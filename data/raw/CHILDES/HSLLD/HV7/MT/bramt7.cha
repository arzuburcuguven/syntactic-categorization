@Comment:	Seems to be a dinner , though the menu is more like breakfast. Mealtime is about 29 minutes long. GFA is cooking eggs and toast while Chi and Mot discuss Chi's geography homework. Chi seems fond of calling various people liars. GFA reveals the reason to save all those old National Geographics: to cut out pictures for kids' school projects. Chi talks with his mouth full , but that isn't nearly as annoying as GFA and Chi's whistling. Chi also describes fooling around with a generator in science class. I'm not so convinced by the arguement that the science teacher doesn't get shocked because she's <used to it> from having studied science for so long. Still , MOT recognizes the <blue thing> as static electricity , and points out a household instance of it.
