@Comment:	MT is Mot , FAT , Chi , and younger Bro , and is about 30 minutes long. They overlap each other constantly. I don't know what the discourse implications are , but it drives a transcriber nuts! The conversation is good- natured , but usually not very interesting. Bro is into sound effects. 20 minutes into the MT Chi seems to be indulging in some solo fantasy talk at the dinner table. Fat talks about doing a book report project with Chi.
