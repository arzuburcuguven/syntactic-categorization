and write a story ?
dear eric carle .
from clara .
i like the book you made the very hungry caterpillar .
becuse it is so funny it is like the caterpillar is loving to death .
do his or her mother know that him or her is doing this .
well you just also can be just a regular old letter to him .
if you want to just write a letter to him asking him .
so you can ask you know .
write my name on it ?
well it's a letter .
how do you how do you do a letter usually ?
i'll give this to you .
right .
that's exactly what we're thinking of doing .
taperecorder baby going ?
yes he is going .
okay .
don't you don't have to take .
thanks .
how is it ?
good .
let me see .
you did a nice job .
just sat down and did it !
good .
dear eric carle i like the book you made the very hungry caterpillar because it is so funny and it is like the caterpillar is .
starving !
to death .
good .
do his or her mother know that him or her is doing this ?
like he went through and ate all the things in the kitchen without without asking ?
thank you that was nice .
good question .
so do you need a surface to write on ?
dear eric carle i like your book the very hungry caterpillar .
i like the nice colorful pictures especially the page with the colorful butterfly on it .
but the best part i like is when he kept on eating and he got big and fat i never knew caterpillars can eat so much .
from chi .
no .
let me get you something .
will this help chi ?
a tv tray .
if it's not it's okay .
stop .
i don't know what to write .
well .
what do you write in letters to people ?
i don't know .
it's your letter you can say whatever you want .
what do you think about the book chi ?
do you remember ?
let's first listen go over the pages so that'll refresh your mind .
you haven't seen this book for years chi ?
you enjoyed it so much .
do you remember ?
look .
wait a minute the last page .
here .
now .
this is the author .
who is it ?
you're writing the letter to him right ?
how do you start a letter ?
dear mister .
blah his name .
you might want to read a little bit about the author .
that gives you an idea how he wrote and then illustrated the book .
let's see .
he's known all around the world as an outstanding original artist and designer .
he does all the designs right ?
they're beautiful and colorful ?
born in the united states .
he spent some years in germany .
what else ?
can we use all this information .
to help you chi .
his first children's book were immediately successful and he now devotes his full full time to their writing and illustrating .
you could ask him a question .
you could just tell him something about the book .
you could tell him something about yourself .
he has two grown children and his wife barbara live in massachusetts .
he lives at the other end of the state .
isn't that something ?
and and look his books have been translated into over a dozen languages .
very interesting chi ?
i'm sure he'll love that letter .
i was in a toy store yesterday looking for christmas gifts and they have a very hungry caterpillar game out now .
so .
we we didn't make you play that though .
like the hungry hippos only sort of .
i was sort of like my god .
ricky you want to say hi .
what is your name i'm sorry .
my name is ellen .
no he doesn't want to say hi .
i didn't realize how famous this book is .
and the author .
over six million copies of his beloved book have been sold since then .
it says what is it illustration ?
translated into a dozen languages chi .
wonder if they have it in spanish ?
probably a good thing to look for ?
alright .
do you read and speak spani i mean you speak spanish right ?
no .
no ?
do you understand it ?
i do .
some .
so i started talking to them in spanish for the last two three years .
see that wasn't their primary language .
right .
so that makes it harder .
and they don't listen to it .
okay .
well you could tell him why you like it .
maybe because you are an artist too chi .
like drawing and coloring .
such a beautiful story ?
careful there .
why do you have it spelled differently chi ?
colors ?
easy to understand him .
no ?
don't you think ?
the ending ?
i don't know what else can you say ?
you may even ask him write .
tell him that you are learning spanish .
you might want to ask him if he is .
selling his book in spanish too .
there are so many things to say about this book chi .
you got a lot down there .
not only he got big and fat but what else ?
he got very full .
he really .
he developed into a beautiful butterfly .
think the ending is the best part of it .
well my opinion chi .
they want to hear from you .
by the way talking about this book now i kept thinking you know because i lost a lot of my spanish l learning more english how do you say in spanish .
no .
how do you say in spanish ?
and i checked in the dictionary .
it's a funny word .
what is it .
spa .
spa ?
spa .
spa .
not not spa .
spa .
doesn't it sound funny ?
so it .
doesn't .
very unusual w word in our language .
and i was like .
first time i i've seen that word in my lifetime .
right .
no one ever says it that's probably why .
that is why chi .
kind of cute his face .
kind of funny looking ?
with big eyes .
like he's looking at you .
he looks a little .
a little scared .
caught in the headlights .
she's a writer .
and a reader .
she has this great teacher this year now .
she .
encourages them and really motivates to reading and writing .
i can tell .
she's a good teacher .
so she has been doing a lot of that lately .
anything else ?
why don't you sign it ?
now see chi don't you find his information interesting ?
how famous his book is and how many books that he published .
that's it ?
i also put my name at the bottom ?
that's usually how it goes on a letter but put it at the top if you want .
i usually do it at the bottom .
so funny ?
that you never knew a caterpillar could eat so much .
i would like to know where he gets all that stuff he eats .
this at the of the spring ?
went to a picnic for that one .
not in winter .

it's tall .
sprinkles are good .

you have a bunch of .
candycanes in the back of .
down in well .
just make sure we throw them out before the spring and the ants come .
ants ?

hunhunh .
if this were the end of february next month could be tomorrow !

it's frosting .
okay .
sticky frosting .
it's sticky and gooey .
right ?
and .
i call it paint .

because it's like paint .
and it and the gooey paint .
we .
put it in .
on the .
graham crackers .
right ?
and .
we make one over here .
on a flat surface .
we made one right here .
sticky ?
and then we put two right here .
and then .
for what ?
and on top of here .
two more .
and then one on top of here .
like a block .
four walls and a ceiling .
and then we .
and then like that .
and then like .
that .
and then like that !
i never thought of doing that .
that's kind of an easy way to do it isn't it ?
all you need is some .
is some .
you know .
that stuff that .
bakers use ?
flour ?
all you need is pour flour in ?
and and .
put some eggs in .
and then .
have a mixer .
to mix it .
right ?
and mix it ?
right and then it will turn into frosting .
did you use your licorice sticks yet ?
that you brought in ?
we didn't use them at all .
are you going to ?
no .
can i have one ?
i like to take them apart and do it .
then take take it apart .
after you lick it .
if if you're gone on .
immediate one .
and you use iron ?
to learn about .
it wasn't chewed .
like very good .
and i swallowed it because i thought it was chewed good .
careful .

let them know .
that we're taking it back ?

did your class make one .
giant gingerbread house or does each kid make one ?
one giant gingerbread house .
it had a .
door that opens and shuts !

we i i forget .
we .
did something clever .
something and we could go all go in it we could all go in it .
i climbed on the top .
no i did i didn't climb on the top though .
i didn't think so .
but they made but they made !
it strong enough to hold itself in when a lots of peop all the people who go in ?
used lots of graham crackers .
and i mean lots !
we we wanted to put it over a desk so we did .
we did .
we put it was so big that it could fit over all !
our desks .

fifty ch on .
five chairs to reach the .
top .
really ?
five .
your =?
the teacher didn't think that was dangerous ?
why didn't you bring in a ladder ?
a ladder ?
because then we'd have to lean it on the house .
right ?
jeez you got a point there .
then the .
then the house would break .
but the chairs can stand on their own ?
that's funny .
if we stacked these chairs together they wouldn't stand on their own .
they'd tip over .
i know .
they're not meant to .
to take them .
and put them on top of each other though .
no ?
our !
chairs are .
wooden chairs .
they're not as big as these ones .

well you never were in the children's room before .
it was .
probably if you knocked all the walls out of here it was about this size ?
now they've got .
that whole block !
where the library is .
down in the basement is a children's room ?
they haven't ?
got enough books to fill it up .
you know there's like .
the nonfiction was probably along .
if you put it along the .
living room wall .
with shelves from floor to ceiling .
that's all the nonfiction .
they have this giant room !
for it and there wasn't anything there .
well maybe they haven't got .
all the she all the shelves to the books .
could've fooled me .
mom .
the li the the library that we went to was a en ente enti .
entire state building .
the empire state building .
bro it's bigger than .
than my !
library ?
they have at school .
i don't know why librarians are so strange .
how come ?
they're all strange .
he's not hogging it you can eat it .
there's not that much there .
i didn't give you a whole bunch .
it's not a telephone .
well what happened to your telephone ?
bro got special treatment today .
what is that ?
well if you want to take a library !
book out linda does library time first thing in the morning right ?
and i told bro before i left make sure you get .
a library !
book today so you can have it for the weekend .
but bro didn't do it .
so at the end of the day .
i said you didn't get a library book ?
and i said you know i didn't know that they hadta do it first thing in the morning .
so i said well why don't you go pick one out real quick .
and laurie said something ?
they have to do it first thing in the morning .
well linda was standing there and she said bro come over here can you keep a secret .
and i said no !
ha !
and .
she said don't tell any of the other kids but .
go over there and very secretly pick out a book and you don't even have to sign it out .
linda does it for him .
she just keeps track of them because nobody .
sorry .
nobody brings them back ?
i'm getting it chi .
just the books they have in the classroom .
well they got another book at my school .
they do ?
what's that one ?
mom guess what ?
what mom guess what what ?
i felt bad that they sat in a line .
you feel bad for who ?
i don't .
well i don't i think ?
the last ones in a line .
the big red hen .
i know laurie told me but let's see if it's what laurie told me .
what ?
the hen the dog had the cat .
what ?
i've heard this .
and guess what ?
i know .
do you know what laurie told me ?
what ?
she said bro is really in touch with his feelings isn't he .
and i said .
and she said because we were reading the little red hen .
and linda said how do you think the little red hen felt .
when nobody would help her .
and bro said i bet she felt real sad and bad that nobody would help her .
mom .
what ?
i've !
heard that .
i didn't say that .
you didn't ?
well laurie !
told me you did .
mom .
you know what ?
what ?
at the end .
they all want him to eat the bread ?
i don't know i don't know that story .
i know .
they all wanted to eat the bread .
and then the hen ate it all by herself ?
because they didn't help her ?
that that's what i'd !
do wouldn't you ?
no help .
no eat ?
i told lenny about that newspaper reporter ?
he he assured me he was quite busy and he hadta he only had two !
minutes you know ?
so i told him and he said gee i don't know .
guess the answer .
i'm going to have to ask doctor zoch about that .
freedom of the press as far as i'm concerned .
that's right .
if it's publicized how bad the schools are doing and they're looking for donations that's their problem .
mom .
what babe ?
if i was a person who done ?
the school ?
excuse me .
more rice .
you know what ?
what is it ?
i'd wr write up all the idiots .
what ?
well there would go mr ariveno .
no he !
that's it folks .
that's all all that's left .
how is this ?
did you eat your sandwich at school today or just your pie ?
my sandwich and !
my pie .
and my .
milk .
i meant juice .
i was going to say tricked you you didn't have milk .
you should've seen what the central kitchen sent for bro's lunch today .
we were all sitting there trying to figure out .
whether it was peanut butter on the bread because you couldn't tell ?
and guess what .
it was peanut butter and orange juice .
well i told linda .
what was it ?
peanut butter .
on bread .
macaroni .
macaroni .
macaroni and .
mom it must have been very gross you know why ?
why it was .
mr ari mr ariveno came .
and he didn't even eat !
it .
mom .
what ?
you leaving bro ?
well if mr ariveno wouldn't eat it it must've been pretty bad ?
linda said she'd like to .
she !
would like to .
buy the food outright .
instead of .
using the money .
you know how they contract with them ?
to give the centers the option .
of purchasing their own materials to make the lunches with ?
she said i'd rather see them eating .
sandwiches every day .
than this stuff .
i mean the macaroni and cheese looked like it was albino it was so bad .
i mean it was really .
and .
so she says .
they said that we could do .
breakfast !
however we wanted .
but the lunch in order to meet the requirements of the federal government .
why can't they have a nu .
they had to have a hot lunch .
you know ?
honey ?
that woman goes down to that high school at least every other week complaining about some .
she showed !
me a roll of hamburgers she had and she said we'd just rather have it bulk and prepare it ourselves so it'd be hot .
she showed me a roll of hamburger patties they sent her .
there was so much grease in there that there was white !
all stuck to the plastic .
you couldn't even see the meat .
and the minute she opened it up there were like big chunks of fat sitting in the the patties ?
and .
so linda said they'd like to do .
like oatmeal and stuff .
so i told her i'd go over to the .
the bakery and arrange for her to .
pick up on tuesdays ?
to get some muffins and some regular bread .
she said she'd get .
like real !
peanut butter and jelly instead of that stuff that you can't identify .
those kids don't know what they're missing .
don't make sense .
they pay three thousand dollars a year for their food in the high school .
i'd like some of them eat it .
want more milk ?
well linda was sitting there eating it .
and she said .
god i've been here too long it tastes good to me .
but what gets me is it's supposed to be like the !
nutritious meal of the day for low income children that supposedly don't get fed balanced !
food at home .
and they're eating garbage .
i told bro that we because he was looking at it and he went like this ew .
i said you don't have to eat it bro we'll get something to eat when we go home .
because they .
they put that peanut butter on all the bread and make sandwiches out of it cut it in half and stuff it back into the .
bread loaf .
wrapper ?
because i went up and i said linda you want me to go get that stuff there's a a loaf of bread down there .
she said they sent us bread ?
then she said no it's probably that .
nut butter stuff that they use .
mom they don't even know what they're missing do they ?
who the kids ?
what ?
because some of them some of my !
kids they they .
they buy !
every day .
what ?
you mean the kids at your school don't know what they're missing by eating .
yuck .
monday mini subs tuesday pizza wednesday hot dogs and beans thursday .
they don't know what they're missing .
they're eating ever the same thing every day .
see and the thing is .
like i told you carole over at .
ed's school .
she said two thirds of the school have the free lunch meal tickets ?
and .
you know giving them stuff like that they're just throwing away taxpayers's money because i can guarantee that them kids .
toss that stuff right in the trash .
do you do the kids that have the lunch tickets have .
to buy !
their lunch ?
sometimes .
do they usually throw most !
of it away or just a little bit ?
usually .
they take one bite .
throw up .
no spit it back in and then .
god .
what ?
and then put it in the trash .
well that meeting .
that we had with bill minny over that .
right before i =?
he resigned ?
lenny said he'd like to see them lose that peanut butter stuff .
because what it is is .
like .
government you know .
federal government peanut butter ?
that's .
like all mealy tasting ?
and they take that and mix .
jelly with it in a bread mixer up at the high school .
they mix it all together so the kids don't drop it on the floor and like get it all stuck all over everything ?
and you can't even see !
the jelly .
it's way too much peanut butter in proportion to the jelly you know ?
i forgot to tell you .
what ?
you know what that ?
the kids threw away ?
once .
he he had two !
trays he bought .
then .
he picked up all the stuff out !
of the other ones .
chicken nuggets .
no anthony ?
and all the little potato puffs and put them in his dish .
to eat ?
out of the trash ?
no n no there's a little tray !
that you put it on and then they put it in the trash ?
and he took them all out and then put some in his trash tray ?
no wait you're losing me .
i don't get it .
you know the little silver things that they .
the little foil dishes .
he takes it and puts that !
stuff in his .
so he'll have more .
you see .
you mean what the kids are done with and don't want he eats it ?
i believe it looking at anthony .
yup !
ew !
ew is right !
that's who was saying the other day right ?
what he likes you ?
fat chubby .
it's because he sees you with all the good snacks he's he's working on you and hoping one day you'll fork over your apple pie .
or this .
my good !
delicious !
tasting peanut butter sandwiches .
aren't you sick of those yet ?
no .
mom .

he eats other people's leftovers .

what ?
no but sometimes he buy buys like .
well mom sometimes he takes the people's whole !
trays .

his .
but what don't the other kids say something ?
no .
are you making this up ?
no .
he i .
i really see him doing this .
yuck ?
well how come they let him do that ?
how come the kids let him do that ?
k because it's on the tray and they're and they're finished with it .

mrs warden teaching .
someone how to be a teacher .
she's teaching someone in your class how to be a teacher ?
no .
she teaching one of her friends .
during school ?
and what did she do with you ?
probably just about all of it .
mrs warder showed her how to to do the stuff on the black board .
said to pay attention really good .
because she might be a substitute teacher .
here it comes .
okay .
so what's this new woman's name ?
cathy i think .
mrs ?
she's not mrs she's only in college .
mrs warden got taught in college .
tto know how to be one .
shh .
i'm sorry what did you say about the second grade teacher ?
mrs warder was learning how to be a teacher from second grade .
where did this girl go to school did she say ?
no .
was she nice ?
was she pretty ?
kind of .
she is .
probably is .
i think it's just about like up to here maybe .
shoulder length ?
but it's not like most straight hair that goes right in like that .
because she has got curly hair .
want to shut the door to the deck ?
okay .
alright that's good .
let go .
this out .
phone book .
so how come you got those math problem wrong ?
i thought i put them right maybe i took them back though .
mamma ?
use your fork please .
okay .
it will not come off .
well if you want to go over with me after supper we'll go over .
see what we did wrong .
unless the number are close together were supposed to cart count down .
but if they're close together just count one like nine and ten .
nine like count nine and one more you can make the little lines in your paper if you need .
that .
so nine take away one is one .
nine take away one is eight .
no !
nine take away ten is one .
no ten take away eleven .
ten take away nine is one .
mrs warden always says it's the other the same way .
if you had nine !
and you took away ten !
it would give you a negative one .
what's negative ?
less than zero .
what's a negative twelve ?
a negative twelve ?
you don't have to worry about negative numbers yet .
what grade are you in when you do that ?
a higher grade .
third ?
not sure .
third's when you start cursive writing .
mrs warden said if i do it now i will not know how to do it in third grade .
i'm five inches taller than jeffrey and jeffrey jeffrey looks taller than me .
everybody says jeffrey's the tallest .
so when joshua tries to measure him .
and but he was to short so jennifer did it .
tomorrow's gym day .
these aren't peaches they're .
what is this ?
fruit cocktail .
brr !
cold !
what does that crazy cat have ?
i don't know .
want to get it ?
what is that ?
where does it go then ?
the radio .
that's what i thought .
look !
hold on !
excuse me could you leave !
please !
go !
go !
go !
so what've you been doing ?
today ?
i don't know .
it depends .
i did groceries and cleaned up the house .
and that .
was kristen there ?
had to leave early i was chopping ice this afternoon too that's how i got the blisters on my hand .
how does snow make you get blisters ?
ice .
when you have to chop it up .
i thought you chop it with the snow shovel or something .
you chop it with an ice chopper .
but it's not easy if the ice is real thick .
sometimes to get it apart you gotta use your hands ?
then how do you get the blisters with the ice ?
the friction on the .
handle of the ice chopper .
how do you get sun blisters ?
from being in the sun too long .
got a wicked sensitive skin she she hadta wear a shirt over a bathing suit because got .
sun blisters too much .
it was a long shirt because she usually hasta wear a bikini .
remember when we went to florida and amy had sun blisters all over her arms ?
no .
and she hadta wear one of your turtlenecks in swimming .
my skin isn't that sensitive .
but then again i put sun screen on you .
tammy doesn't put it on amy ?
mo most vicki never brought suntan lotion for her when she went to camp that's probably why .

i'll let you decorate them .
if you want to do that .

for your .
christmas party .

mom .
there's twenty five people .
i know .
would you bro she can't expect you to buy a gift for every person in the class .
you told me one person .
either that or i can bring like a football in for everybody .
i mean just like .
one that like everybody can use without anybody's permission like that .
the kind that we have in school .
what do you mean ?
to donate like to the classroom like you did you did for everybody in the class ?

mom she will not even let us spend two dollars on a gift for the christmas .
grab .
she wants you to spend a dollar right ?
that's because there's a lot of kids bro that can't afford two dollars .
so she's trying to be fair and make sure that everybody .
that's why they do that .
just like at work if i grab at my christmas grab .
you're only supposed to spend ten dollars .
because there you know a lot of times people don't have the money to spend .
why what did you got for your christmas grab ?
i got some beer .

we spent four hours in the edit room .
and we got about another .
t three and a half minutes of finished tape done .
four i know i meant to time it .
maybe four .
and i meant to time it .
sorry i i didn't .
we got ten minutes done .
so .
how much do we have done all together ?
i have to time it .
i think it's about .
thirteen and a half fourteen minutes .
done .
really .
we should time it i'd like to see what i've done if it's okay at the end .
so we're .
somewhere between thirteen and fourteen minutes into the tape .
but i'd have to time it to .
be positive .
so i'd !
say that we're probably .
going to end up with a thirty minute story .
that's what i thought all along .
you think .
that right about that ?
i'm i don't know .
we have a thirty minute master tape .
well .
i told you i thought i'd be thirty minutes .
but a thirty minute master tape means that it's about thirty two minutes .
why ?
of actual running time on the tape .
yes that's why it's thirty two minutes .
so that you have running time in and out of the piece .
because you think about the story .
i'm trying to think .
more than halfway through the story .
but .
still there is .
still .
the end part .
when she wakes up and then there's the credits .
well .
next time .
we edit we can .
do the credits .
and put that onto a tape .
put it all on to the end of tape seven .

what does he advertise ?
the woman this morning we saw going to .
she wanted to do .
an exercise show .
and so she went to rex trailor's company .
and had rex trailor direct her first exercise video .
if you if you know rex trailor you're really trying to hide .
well she said that he was very nice .
not extremely confident as a director .
and charged too much .
well he's a local celebrity .
who is rex trailor ?
honey .
one of those .
he u he used to have a kids's show when we were kids .
he was a cowboy .
he was on channel five .
we've told you about this .
and .
haven't we seen davey and goliath ?
on five it was going to be on .
he's never seen davey and goliath ?
he's never seen davey and goliath .
davey .
i just do that for him .
and saturday mornings .
they had this .
little song .
and all the kids would go .
and it'd be like a variety show .
and there'd be this guy who's supposed to be .
mexican i guess .
that was his side kick .
pablo .
and they would do like funny stuff and .
and they would show cartoons and they had david and goliath .
they did on sunday .
they would pretend .
the kids would walk with him up to this little church in the hill .
like a little new england church .
the little white church on a hill and they would sit there .
i remembering this wrong !
they walked to a church in a hill !
no .
they didn't .
no .
they .
they did !
they did !
and then they watched davey and goliath !
the kids watched davey and goliath but they didn't .
they would go to a cut away .
of rex trailor .
riding his horse goldie across a field .
to the chapel .
the kids went to the church !
the kids did not go to the church !
well .
i was never on the show .
so i can't say for certain .
but i believe .
the kids went to the church .
and he rode his horse .
he rode his horse .
i remem i forgot that his horse was named goldie .
and pablo walked the kids over !
i'm completely fabricating this !
it's not true .
i fibbed i .
he did .
okay .
it's a one set show right ?
not that big a studio .
and this fake little western street .
in this dingy little studio in boston .
i bet it didn't look like that on tv .
alright .
it didn't !
look like that on tv .
and .
and they're going to march these kids from the studio .
okay ?
on a live show .
up .
a new england hill .
a h .
up a new england hill !
the little white church !
the little white church .
it was very solemn .
and then they hadta watch davey and goliath .
it always had a moral to the story .
gee davey .
what was goliath ?
goliath was a dog !
a dog .
she doesn't even remember what goliath was .
and she's going to argue with me about this .
he's not a cartoon !
it was .
animated .
it was what dear ?
animated .
but it wasn't a cartoon .
is that what they were like .
clay puppets or something ?
sort of like clay .
claymation .
no it wasn't claymation .
no .
i guess they were kind of like little dolls .
claymation !
no !
it was before .
claymation .
but .
anyway .
now .
the ride .
i can even sing you the song that rex trailor .
had when he rode to the chapel .
hoof beats hoof beats hoof beats .
ride .
goldie ride .
ride across the prairie ride .
hoof beats hoof beats hoof beats .
ride cowboy ride .
and he looked so dashing on his horse .
anyway now he sells trips .
like bus trips or something ?
bus trips .
those tours .
you should work for the boston globe .
why .
maybe the herald ?
no .
don't laugh ?
sit up and eat .
but .
okay .
he sells vacations .
to disney land .
and to disney world .
and to knott's berry farm .
and he has a name like something tours .
right ?
universal .
no .
what's the name of the .
company ?
it's usually done through crimson travel .
i don't know what the name of the company is .
anyway .
he dresses up in his cowboy outfit and he .
has his .
new side kick sergeant billy because pablo kicked the bucket .
and and they sell these .
trips .
on tv .
next time we see it i'll point it out to you .
nonna gotta meet rex trailor .
i think they're called getaway tours .
thank you !
i knew the word was in there .
but you'll still argue with me about all the kids marching up the hill to the studio .
they did !
go up to the church on sunday .
they did .
they must have painted one of the tv towers over channel five in needham .
to look like a church .
okay .
you know where channel five is right ?
right near you do it electronics .
be that as it may .
they still had the kids go up to some new england church !
or they made it look !
like they did it .
on a live show .
did they have a set ?
that .
where the kids walked through a doorway ?
white .
the kids walked .
inside the set .
they walked down the little street .
and they would .
walk into one of the doors .
they had all these doors .
but the just walked to the other side of a flat .
yes but there was no hill !
they never left the building !
they stayed inside the studio .
they showed a hill .
they showed him riding across a hill .
so that's the magic of tv honey .
no that's the magic of a little girl that believes too much !
you're funny .
very funny .
i don't know .
sometimes i wish that the world was filled with people like your mother and i was a salesman .
were you a salesman !
boy life would be boring then !
what's that ?
life would be boring then .
we would be able to go anywhere we wanted .
anybody want a compliment ?
me any more ?
i love you .
i'd still marry you .
thank you .
i'd still marry you .
that's your assumption .
did pablo really kick the bucket .
did pablo really kick the bucket ?
i still want to know the effect that butch for a day had on the young girls on bozo .
never mind .
why worry about .
why don't i tell the story about nonna and rex trailor .
right ?
i just have to ask dad one thing .
well he's in the bathroom !
must you ask him ?
what is it ?
i have to .
go ahead .
sit !
the pablo died okay ?
does that make you feel better ?
good .
now eat up .
and i'll tell you the story about nonna and rex trailor .
okay .
while you eat .
as a you know .
you can probably tell .
from the conversation that i was a big fan of rex trailor .
and i watched in town very faithfully .
as a child .
once when i was a a kid .
i was on this group trip .
kids in our neighborhoods went on this trip .
with the peabody house .
when she was a child .
when i was a child .
ma !
chi .
eat up !
you may not !
speak !
because i'm concerned about the rice okay ?
so what happened was .
they had this big bowl .
for everyone to fill out .
a contest thing .
you put your .
entry in the bowl and i did that like everyone else who .
could write .
and .
as it turned out .
i won the grand prize .
what was that ?
go lightly on the pepper because it's mostly going onto your spoon .
don't .
get it on the food .
the grand prize unfortunately most of it i ?
couldn't have .
it was mostly stuff that you hadta be over eighteen to get .
i like pepper .
yes i know but that's a lot of pepper in one bite .
you just .
watch him and see and .
spout fire !
out of his mouth here !
chi .
here .
i do not mean to make you laugh .
i really didn't mean to make you laugh then .
with with milk in your mouth .
anyway chi .
the prizes were .
a little shopping spree .
for i don't know like thirty dollars at a real fancy store .
i don't know .
bonwit teller i think .
was the store .
and .
a night out .
for two people .
with rex trailor .
the people .
get to choose .
the winner .
gets to choose anywhere they want to go .
now .
since i was too young .
for the prize .
i got a token .
flower arrangement .
fresh flowers all pretty .
all around this candle in the middle .
boy that's cheap !
well i liked .
i liked in anyway .
but the other part i got out of it was really good .
because the people on their trip with rex trailor .
get to have a limousine pick them up .
was it a limousine ?
a rolls royce .
rolls royce !
how could i forget !
i don't know .
you still have the picture .
i still have it's fading .
i need a copy of it before it's gone .
okay .
forever .
well it'll never go forever even if it fades .
completely from view .
we can bring it back .
good because a lot of my .
childhood is .
fading in all those photographs .
i tell you .
right .
but if we sepia chemical name them .
okay .
we can .
take whatever silver base there is .
and bring them out .
and bring them out .
good .
anyway chi .
eat up .
what happened was .
since i was the winner and i didn't get to go on a trip with rex trailor .
when the rolls royce guy came to our house .
in the projects .
to pick up .
n nonna and .
steve smith .
was her boyfriend who lived with us .
a real nice guy .
they !
decided to go to a poetry reading of dylan .
dylan thomas .
poetry reading .
and rex trailor hadta go with them to the poetry reading .
and anyway .
so .
this beautiful rolls royce with real firm seats comes in .
and since i didn't win .
i won but i couldn't go .
i we gotta have a ride !
anywhere we wanted before they took .
florida !
before the took nonna .
and steve over to their .
big event for the night .
florida .
no .
no no .
not that .
anywhere .
what we did was .
we went to nana's and back .
so .
nana gotta see all of us in a rolls royce .
in everett .
and then back !
to some of the projects and we had the guy beep !
his horn .
so everyone would look out and see us in a rolls royce and .
and uncle george was there .
he was .
no we kicked ?
him aside and said george this is my ride .
george .
this is mine .
no !
george came along .
he was georgie back then .
he was a little kid .
georgie .
so we had fun !
because we had this great trip .
in a rolls royce which .
was very exciting .
and then .
i'm sorry .
i'm stuffed if you'll excuse me .
should excuse yourself ?
sure .
what ?
i understand .
so anyway .
nonna .
gotta go to bonwit teller and buy .
herself a fancy pair of shoes i think .
i don't know what else she got .
and they decided to go to a poetry reading of dylan thomas .
which .
i've heard was a child's christmas and what else ?
dad reads it sometimes .
and we just saw a thing about it on the tv once s story of it .
and rex trailor .
apparently .
hates .
doesn't really like poetry reading ?
he was not !
very pleased .
he hadta go and they had dinner with rex trailor .
and then they went to a poetry reading and .
i guess he was really bored and .
he wasn't pleased and nonna !
was very embarrassed .
to have dinner with rex trailor .
she thought it was a thing that was embarrassing .
she didn't want me to tell .
any of her friends .
that she had dinner with rex trailor .
why ?
she thought it was silly .
but she gotta have a fun night out .
you shut up .
and that was the story .
that's why dad said .
don't bring rex trailor to the .
poetry reading .
because of that story .
you can ask nonna about it .
next time you see her which will probably be .
sunday when we have a birthday party for chi's older brother .
say .
ask !
her about it !
and you see she'll have an embarrassed face .
and i'll tell .
and i'll say to her .
my mom your .
little daughter told me to say that !
and sometime when i come across the photograph i'll show you .
the driver of the rolls royce .
took a picture .
for us .
and .
gave it .
to me .
of .
me and nonna and steve and .
me george .
you know it i can't remember if uncle george was in the picture .
i might have i might have said it was .
my prize !
you can't be in the picture !
i i can't remember if i was that crummy or not .
so who cares if you're not .
eighteen .
i don't think uncle george really cared about whether or not he was in the picture .
because he gotta ride in a rolls royce and both !
of us were having a lot of fun in the back seat .
it was all real furs !
fancy car .
real fur ?
real .
fur .
real fur .
fur on that seat .
it was .
very strange .
they .
they can't do that !
i i know .
there's a .
see at the time i really didn't have a problem with it .
why not ?
i really can't tell you .
i thought it was very luxurious .
now !
it would .
really gross me out .
the thought of .
you know .
dead animals .
they weren't allowed to kill animals .
well .
but people have fur coats !
you just watched .
who's the boss .
what kind of coat did that .
samantha get ?
fur coat .
where do you think they got the fur ?
from polyester .
no .
it was a real fur coat .
people still have real fur coats .
and buy them .
fewer people now then there used to be .
it used to be a s .
you know what you call a symbol of .
greatness .
to have a fur coat .
a lot of people still think it's a symbol of greatness .
but a lot of people think it's .
really disgusting .
really crappy ?
i wouldn't buy real fur .
excuse my language .
i wouldn't want a real fur coat .
sit .
and eat .
where is that ?
a green bean !
yuck !
it's over there !
please .
pick it up and throw it away .
and don't drop any more .
it's getting late .

you're not going to be able to have a dessert .
because you're eating too slowly .

they never saw that kid again .
that's gross .
well i think that .
we missed the beginning of it .
but i believe there was like he was the kid that just came there for the summer .
maybe .
they didn't .
they didn't say that the dogs killed the kid on the movie .
well it's obvious ma !
no !
i don't think so .
the dog when the dog gave back that retainer .
the kid's retainer .
i thought that it was a sign that he was giving that retainer back for the kids for them .
they saw their friend again .
chi what ?
don't !
chi .
don't look at me .
don't look at me .
just hand me your milk .

i didn't tell anybody .
ate a half .
that .
it's red ?
crystal sugar .
and dad's not .
chi .
drink your milk .
trouble .
why ?
because if dad were to come in while you were there .
spitting your milk out or anything disgusting like that .
he'd probably get ang aggravated .
it's making me .
and i would hide the sugar .
and i would tell my dad .
and i would hide the sugar .
time to go .
where is sugar .
where is sugar here i am .
here i am .
how are you today .
run and hide .
other finger !

we used to do this .

run away .
chi .
put your fingers in your mouth ?
you didn't have sugar on them !
ronald reagan rona .
speaking of sugar chi .
recently .
i was walking in the kitchen .
and guess what .
i walked over by the refrigerator right ?
and there was .
sugar .
on the floor .
white sugar on the floor .
and .
i was just wondering .
do you know how it got there ?
what were you doing ?
with the sugar .
i would say that's gross except .
what ?
it would be hypocritical of me .
and .
there we go .
now put it down .
and now i say to you chi .
that's disgusting .
don't eat !
handfuls of sugar !
you got sugar on the floor !
that's a .
that you don't want sugar on the floor .
believe me .
somehow i thought it was .
it was either you or dad .
i thought about it long and hard chi .
and i eliminated dad as the one who may have spilled sugar .
well he could've .
it could happen .
but it wasn't like .
your dad doesn't spill .
things right in front of the fridge that often .
in fact i can't remember the last time your dad spilled anything in front of the fridge .
i can remember the last time you spilled something .
it was milk .
i know .
but .
i didn't i knew that i wasn't the one that spilled the sugar .
so i spilled the sugar .
but by the time i noticed it i think it was either after bedtime or you were out playing .
i don't know .
there was some reason why i could not ask you about it .
don't ?
do it anymore .
okay .
mom !
how dare !
you eat so much sugar !
me ?
yes !
i'm innocent .
completely !
look at that .
my hands .
clean .
no sugar .
let me feel your finger .
let me feel your finger .
no .
no it's not .
chi .
leave my finger alone .
a little reddish her finger ?
must've been that nail polish .
ha no !
well over on the other side ?
chi !
leave it !
you !
are still eating dinner .
i caught your red !
chi ?
whatever dad's listening to or watching has interesting music on .

very boring .
no i like the sound of it .
that's what i call it boring .
honey what are you watching ?
what ?
what are you watching ?
a .
special about indians .
a special about an indian .
it might be interesting .
the music sounded good .
it sounded kind of .
no .
outlandish .
no .
it sounded kind of .
sad .
eerie indiana is outlandish .
really ?
that's when things are so strange that they don't .
when they seem sort of out of .
context .
or that you would never !
find .
like .
if you were working in a .
bank .
where everyone wears s their outfit .
you know how they wear the suits .
and the women wear dress in kind of quiet colors .
let's say you came to work with .
big feathers !
sticking out of your hair and stuff .
right ?
and red tassels .
that would be outlandish !
because it doesn't fit in with .
your you know what you would wear to .
work in a bank .
no .
so you worked at a bank ?
and you usually dressed up in a little pink suit right ?
can you just go up .
to .
a bank every day you went .
right ?
one day you came to school .
you know all those graduate .
graduate's hats ?
can you just go .
to .
the bank with one of those ?
and one of those black !
robes around you that they wear .
and scholarship !
in your hand !
and you were .
came in the door like this .
you didn't walk in .
you went like this .
yippee !
that would be outlandish .
course it would .
you would come in saying .
chi .
my gosh !
i just looked at the time !
and .
so .
i believe .
we were watching jeopardy when we sat down to dinner .
i believe you've been eating for over an hour .
now .
and i've been doing most of the talking so .
it weren't like .
there really isn't any reason !
that you should be at this point .
not only that .
but you really need a bath .
you're going to have to hop in the tub real fast .
the homework's done .
i'm going to start the water .
what you're going to do .
is .
as soon as you're done eating .
you are going to start putting away some of that stuff that you took off the chair .
excuse me .
and you're going to do it .
it's very late .
do not ?
because i have to call and thank her .
you know dad already thanked her but .
he was being sarcastic .
well he was being truthful .
being .
truthful he was .
see ?
you agree .
this is going to be a really fast bath .
alright .
come along .
be nice .
where is stinky where is stinky .
there she blows .
there she blows .
alright .
let's see .
not quiet time to put away any of that stuff .
what we'll do instead is .
we'll just .
as soon as you're done eating pop in the tub .
okay .
no matter how high or low .
the water is that's what the tub the bath will be .
okay ?
okay .
okay .
alright .
shh .
do it again .
mom ?
can you blow .
like this ?
what ?
can you blow ?
like this .
for what purpose ?
you'll see .
no .
i don't want to .
and .
no .
it's dinnertime .
i mean it's not dinnertime .
okay .
after !
dinnertime .
where's stinky where is stinky .
there she blows .
there she blows .
alright chi that's it that's it .
being fresh .
this is fun .
you should .
write your name on your homework .
homework paper away .
by the way this is very good .
your writing .
what do you call this kind of writing ?
penmanship .
no .
but the kind !
of .
what is it called ?
it is not .
what do you call it ?
no .
you knew what it was before .
we call it penmanship .
at school .
you stopped that other stuff .
looks like the same stuff to me .
what was the other stuff called .
beats me .
okay well it looks good .
whatever it is .
whatever it is ?
you mean whatever you call this type of penmanship .
i !
can read it .
very well .
very good penmanship .
okay .
i have a question .
tell me .
why did you write in differently than the type of writing that your practicing ?
because i can't write a in cursive .
a capital .
you ?
never taught me .
i never learned .
well see .
makes sense .
i can jump and hop !
you can find me in a pond !
i eat bugs .
i am a frog .
good .
i forgot where i found him .
arnold arboretum .
that's how you named him arnold .
you haven't written an arnold story in a while .
maybe it's because you haven't visited in a while ?
maybe you should go visit .
and then you can write another story .
in the summer .
you can visit at this time of year .
really ?
they hibernate .
really ?
they go under the .
ice .
ice .
i guess it wouldn't be very .

guess what he gave me another dish .
you're not laughing .
see we have .
a hundred years to live .
a hundred and eighteen a woman was on tv yesterday .
the oldest woman in the world .
no .
she was .
hundred and eighteen years old .
the oldest .
person !
in the world is god .
god's not oldest .
course he is .
i think .
am i right or wrong ?
right .
haha !
lisa says .
lisa lisa .
lisa .
says .
lisa says .
since her name is lisa light and where am i ?
she always right .
hi !
can i get you guys .
somebody .
hi .
lou !
lou .
been a while .
hi .
you want that on my car ?
why don't just get a babysitter for the week ?
i told him to come in and get warm .
tell him to come in and have some ham and carrots .
okay i'm sorry there's no noodles .
and a brew or not .
how ?
a goober .
what are you looking for ?
take the gallon out of the refrigerator and fill it up because there's another one under the sink .
okay .
did you drink all that water yet ?
no it's not under the sink .
lou want one of those grape juices ?
fill it up there's one under the sink .
want me take mark some ?
don't waste it .
how's the spring water in there ?
why ?
just want to know if it's fine .
no don't put spring water in the battery .
no ?
why not ?
it doesn't matter .
who's this for ?
me ?
thank you .
we're all watching you .
maybe it'll jump up .
i know that makes you hot .
let's move in there .
quit bitching .
you go to bed .
obviously you didn't get enough sleep over marshall's last night seeing you're taking it out on me .
well now i'm nervous mom .
she won't let me watch it .
no it's .
have we started yet ?
looks like mom already had a french fry .
now let's be thankful .
well i'd like !
to be thankful but we already started eating so .
alright =?
i'm thankful .
what's your problem chi ?
you're thankful ?
well that's good to know .
i'm glad your thankful .
let's put this where's the microphone on this ?
put it like here .
try and rearrange the table so that .
the recorder can hear things .
okay .
i guess we're about as thankful as we can get .
yep ?
you know one of one of my .
guilt provoking little little .
pagan grace things .
but .
that's okay .
looks like i got the fork with hot chocolate on it .
it's sticky .
course it is .
i think it's the way you sleep .
what's happening in the living room ?
where did chi go ?
to get a drink ?
some grey poupon in the fridge .
he's probably in the morning when i snore .
you make me look bad .
you don't look bad .
was she making faces at you ?
no .
it's only an audio recorder .
it's not going to pick up the faces that mummy makes at you .
unless it was a video camera .
i think they have video cameras that are just a little bit bigger than that .
little .
sony things .
that's because the video cameras are just like .
so !
heavy .
well these use little eight millimeter cassettes .
about the same size as a .
audio cassette .
a little bigger .
it has got like a door thing on the top .
is the rice too watery ?
no .
fine with me .
fine with me too .
it's not sticky .
but it's not .
watery !
i wouldn't call it watery .
but for some reason it's a different kind of rice than =?
that i'm used to .
try a little pepper on it it's good .
in something like chili you don't really taste the pepper as much .
the sunset seems a lot further south than it used to .
mom ?
excuse me ?
no it's not .
it is !
further south .
the sunset .
it used to be just straight that !
way .
it used to be part way .
it used to be that way .
almost exactly west .
a little to the south .
but now !
it's like it's all the way around the .
that wing of the building .
that's how long it's been since i've sat down to eat dinner here .
at this time of the night .
it's a great sunset .
that's what you get for having to work twelve thiry twelve thirty to nine .
you don't get to sit and eat dinner with us .
well .
only on the weekend .
and even then it's like we're always on the go and everything .
and we get everything we couldn't get done during the week .
even when i worked at the hotel though we wouldn't have dinner .
well we would have ?
once a week .
sunday nights we'd have dinner .
but it'd be much later than this !
it's only twenty of five .
like around six .
sorry ?
that's because .
the sun set .
later !
then .
it's already twilight .
yep .
so how do you like .
vegetarian chili .
with rice ?
good .
see i just .
eat my way around it and then i start .
to the middle .
you have very interesting eating habits chi .
see you sort of .
pat it up like a castle .
i don't like rice .
i used to do things like that when i went to summer camp .
dad look .
no i use to make like little landscapes out of my food .
especially the mashed potatos .
mashed potatos was great for making like mountains and things with .
make ?
some peas like in the middle .
it ?
especially .
if you got peas you can sort of like roll them down the side .
like a little landslide down the side .
they're great .
i want to make a fort .
and those little peas can be people .
it's hard to make a fort with mashed potatos .
well .
what i used to do .
you can do it maybe with french fries .
make like a little log log cabin design .
when i was when we lived in east boston i used to just roll it up into a ball and make a big !
fort .
what mashed potatos ?
i used to roll !
them up and make a big fort like this big .
i never had mashed potatos there .
i always did .
you did ?
i always did up until i moved here .
and now .
the only time i do is .
like the only time i don't !
use real potatos is when i make potato pie because you can't .
it's just it's not you can't use !
it with that .
it's not necessary to make mashed potatos from fresh potatos .
it's nice and all but it's much harder .
well i have potato pie in the freezer .
freezer ?
because i just threw one out that was in the fridge .
belongs ?
in the fridge .
but it's in the freezer and .
you just throw it in the oven .
about a half an hour or so to brown it .
and you're all set .
yep .
on mashed potatos ?
butter .
when you worked at .
the hotel .
when you had days off we would have a .
meal together .
chi you remember that ?
answer my question .
are you telling a tale ?
why ?
because i i'm not interested .
with your .
making up a story .
well not in east boston but .
but ?
but ?
but what ?
i just i was just asking you .
i did !
call the publisher .
no .
it's okay to tell stories but please .
tell us you're telling me a story .
okay ?
why ?
it's good to have an imagination chi .
people needta know whether you're telling the truth or not .
so that people don't think you're going to be lying all the time .
big squirm ?
you know the one about the boy who cried wolf don't you ?
what's it about ?
it's about a boy who cried wolf .
i use to do stuff like that in school .
no this morning no kidding .
i told him turn off the tv and go get a book .
he comes out here with a book .
flips through it .
and he says okay i'm done now what ?
i say chi what's the book about ?
he says it's about a boy and a tree .
you know the giving tree .
that's because i read it to him about a million times !
he says it's about a boy and a tree .
and i said chi .
you needta think .
the book is designed to provoke you to think .
it is not !
about a boy and a tree .
it's about friendship .
and greed and giving .
see ?
and sharing .
right .
if you think about .
it is not !
about a boy and a tree .
and if you come out here and tell me it's about a boy and a tree .
i'm going to tell you to read the book again !
but you read it so fast the first time i thought it wouldn't make any difference .
but we've read it so many times in the past .
it's a good book but i think it's sad .
can i have a napkin please ?
because the boy .
is being greedy .
he asks for everything .
and the tree .
gives him everything .
and then at the end .
on the page when you see the .
stump .
and it says and the tree was happy .
but not really .
good .
because there was nothing left of the tree really .
but .
at the end the boy .
well and .
until it had nothing else to give .
and then th the boy still had demands for the tree .
i just need a place to sit .
well .
come sit on my stump .
okay ?
the tree didn't care if he didn't give .
to the tree anything .
ask not what the tree can give to you .
its apples !
its branches !
its trunk .
so what did he do ?
he made a boat !
out of the trunk ?
no he made a boat out of the trunk to sail away far away .
branches a house .
and apples to get money .
and then the stump .
to sit on .
there really only a few cultures that make boats out of tree trunks .
that hollow out the inside of the trunk .
mostly pacific pacific island cultures do that .
only that's not a commonplace thing .
usually when they make boats they make them like rafts .
no other cultures .
i mean like you know .
just the average person would not make a boat out of a tree trunk .
it's very difficult ?
excuse me .
you have to eat more .
alright .
you don't you do not have to eat all of it .
i don't really like the chili .
you have to .
bullshit .
eat it .
i don't like the chili .
i don't .
you were eating it before .
mix it with the rice .
mix it in with the rice .
mix it in with the .
i'm not kidding it really tastes better .
right .
you don't have to eat all of it .
you do have to eat some !
of it .
i just ate !
some of it .
you ate the rice .
you didn't eat any of the chili .
he conveniently ate around the chili .
you made a circle .
and .
a square .
and .
and then i made it into like a house .
because see i .
went like that .
and then like that .
eat it .
no i don't like it .
you love it chi .
well you're not getting any french fries .
put it back .
fine !
no .
french fry before i eat ?
no !
why do they call them french fries if they're not really fried ?
i don't know .
don't you think the food and drug administration would have something to say about this ?
you done ?
i might have a little more .
i haven't decided .
dad what's the matter ?
want me to get it for you ?
no .
i haven't decided .
i know you haven't decided .
but .
do you want me to get it for you ?
no thanks .
remember just squeezed orange juice ?
up to six months ago .
eight months .
eight months ago .
frozen whole .
disgusting .
i mean it really is .
as soon as you pour it in the glass it separates immediately .
i mean you can tell it's not fresh .
they have it on the menu as fresh freshly squeezed orange juice when in fact it's nothing of the sort .
well for that price you would expect freshly squeezed orange juice .
it's like three dollars a glass .
but where where you know where is the same people who cracked down on citrus hill ?
i know .
look mom .
i ate some .
a little more .
chi come on .
it's not going to kill you .
it might just make you know it might give you a little gas !
that's all .
make me ill .
making you ill ?
well then you don't have to eat it if it's making you ill .
you just cannot eat anything else .
well .
eat a little more of the chili and then we'll put you in and you can take a bubble bath .
no !
i don't want .
i hear you got bubble bath .
i don't like !
bubble bath .
i don't take !
bu bubble baths anymore .
it's a joke about you know how he likes to take a bubble bath .
nobody got it but me .
so that's alright .
i don't think in those terms fat .
okay ?
you don't have to .
eat any more if you don't want to .
you cannot eat anything else .
either .
excuse me .
just like when he's .
so full he can't eat another bite and he orders dessert .
i know .
he's funny ?
beautiful sunset .
it is !
when's it going to go down all the way ?
it is !
down all the way .
nuhhuh .
the sun's down .
the sun is .
the sun's down all the way .
can't see the sun any more .
i know .
i'm not going to eat the beans .
i'm going to eat around them .
so eat around them .
you can pick them up with your fork .
i don't care .
i don't think the beans will be too offended .
that that's both cans of .
vegetarian chili ?
used ?
both cans of vegetarian chili .
really ?
because the one i opened the first one didn't look like very much .
because i was thinking that doesn't look pinto beans .
they're small .
i had some pinto beans in here .
and kidney beans .
okay ?
lentils are kidney beans right ?
but ?
they're same .
s they're the same size .
lentils .
lentils are the little tiny ones .
i thought they were the big ones .
no kidney beans are those ones shaped .
like a kidney .
well .
black eyed .
okay ?
you know .
i mean there's a lot of beans that are generally that size and shape .
that's fine but you can't eat anything else .
mom !
if you can't eat chili your chili you can't have french fries .
but i don't like chili .
but you said you'd eat !
it .
no i didn't !
yes you did .
yes you did .
before dinner when i said would you eat chili .
i should've had the taperecorder going then .
i could have proof of it .
and then we could play it back .
but i didn't .
because i would've made you like a macaroni and cheese or something if you didn't like it .
haha .
you said you would eat it .
i thought it was plain !
chili .
it is plain chili !
it has no meat in it .
how do you define plain chili ?
no .
meat chili .
actually .
chi you know better .
i wanted ?
meat chili .
you know better .
we don't eat meat .
pretend it's meat .
you know what you do ?
with the beans and then they'll be like meat .
right .
they'll be .
mashed beans .
stop !
ew don't do that .
ew .
that's gross .
it has your germs on there now .
ew .
so clean out the plate and go give him some more .
ew i'm not going to eat that now because it has bad germs !
actually chili with meat is is rather quite disgusting .
i've had ?
it before .
it's good .
but you don't know what kind of meat i .
is in there .
sometimes they use hamburger .
sometimes they use like ground pork .
ew .
what do you think sausages are made from ?
ground pork .
it's ground pork .
they take the you know the pork that they don't !
want anymore .
they grind it up .
they stick !
it into the pig's intestine .
they tie a little knot on either end .
and they fry it up .
sounds lovely .
i'm glad i'm a vegetarian .
i !
happen to like sausages .
but .
fortunately i don't eat them .
thought you were vegetarian too ?
i am !
doesn't mean i can't like them .
you know .
you didn't even see me do that .
is that is that like .
now that i'm married i don't have i don't have a particular .
type of woman i prefer over others ?
no .
like people've been telling me that for years .
he's you're married .
you don't have a type .
bullshit !
i don't have a type .
me .
no .
what did i marry ?
an inflatable doll ?
of course i have a type .
so they're always gone for months at a time .
i couldn't take that .
and their insurance sucks too .
it does .
they tell me they have really bad insurance .
watch your language .
watch your language .
did i say a bad word ?
you did .
twice .
done ?
there .
i don't know what i said .
see !
it's like .
a habit .
what ?
it's a habit .
what did i do ?
i don't know what i did .
you swear out of habit .
no it's just my .
my mouth was going faster than my brain .
you better eat that before your chili gets cold .
then it'll taste even worse .
i'm not going to eat it .
it is gross when it's cold .
you know what's even worse ?
is if you make like chili with meat you know .
with all that .
fat and everything in it .
and you throw it in the fridge .
and then take it out it has got like this layer of .
this layer of orange jelly on top of it .
orange .
thick white layer .
it's gross .
no ?
you don't have to .
and chicken soup is even worse .
but i'm going to have dessert .
you're not having any dessert or french fries .
come on !
dessert ?
dessert ?
you'll be lucky if you get to eat breakfast .
no chi if you're not ?
full .
i'm going to have macaroni and cheese .
no you're not .
no you're not .
i am ?
no you're not .
got any clean spatulas ?
they're in the dishwasher .
plug your ears .
come on .
come on !
i wanted to spank him .
now or never .
come on .
sit chi come here !
this is being taped .
that means that this is supposed to be .
a typical dinner with us ?
a a typical dinner at home .
and this is what it's like .
our typical dinner at home probably does not consist .
of chi playing with his food .
not eating .
begging for dessert .
slapping daddy's hand .
yes it is .
you know i'm beginning to think we should stop the tape and we'll start it again some other time .
when chi's actually going to eat what we put on the plate in front him .
as a matter of fact i don't think it would be out of line .
to say chi you can't eat anything else until !
you finish what's on the plate .
whether it's cold or whether it has been sitting in the fridge for a month .
somalia is not funny .
let's wrap it up .
in a box and send it to somalia .
chi .
what ?
if you lived i .
we'll ?
wrap you !
up in a box and send you to somalia .
if you lived in somalia .
they can eat you .
chi if you lived if you lived in somalia .
sorry .
if you were a kid living in somalia .
you wouldn't be living any more .
no they don't live very long .
well five thousand of them die every day .
every day .
i don't know what that is times three hundred and sixty five but it has been going on for years .
it's there's nothing funny !
about somalia .
no don't .
get your foot off my chair .
mom !
get your feet of my chair !
eat your dinner .
and i bet you .
if you sent that off to somalia that will =?
would probably have to go go be split up between about a hundred people .
so they wouldn't even get like half a bean each .
cool .
they would get a little piece .
maybe .
and that's what they'll eat for the week .
i would ima i could imagine that they would have quite a swell time !
with our garbage !
and just the little bit of food that we've managed to throw away .
i know .
it's pretty sad .
i think we ought to send this kid up to the peace corps .
aren't we going into mozambique too ?
what's .
mom !
stop making .
faces at me and sticking out your tongue !
i don't see a tongue .

i'm not going to eat it .
he did .
and he did a little parody of michael jackson's little ?
song .
which was .
and there's weird al .
you know like .
there was this huge !
fat person across from him sitting at the table .
kind of like that monty python thing in the meaning of life .
ew .
i mean just just huge beyond .
the limit of of human proportions .
after dinner mint ?

you've been knocking .
among the doors around here asking if you can borrow a cup of hamburger .
borrow a hamburger .
have you seen this commercial ?
this guy who's tossing and turning all night .
he goes over to his neighbor's house .
now .
he hasta go outside the house .
it's the middle of winter .
he's out there in his pajamas to borrow a cup of nyquil .
the man has got a cold !
and yet .
i mean maybe he put on his little bunny slippers or something .
he's out th .
i mean it's like snowing out !
i know .
i saw that .
no wonder why he needs the nyquil .
just eat it .
i don't do nyquil .
eat it .
okay i'll eat you .
ny nyquil's an evil little .
concoction .
it's alcohol !
it's like forty five percent alcohol .
i'm tired .
which is pretty high as medicines go .
ninety proof .
as high as medicine go but you're only taking really like a shot .
or a shot and a half of it really .
but i mean it would be like you know .
sit .
in the olden days they used to take a shot of brandy when anybody was sick .
everybody would drink brandy or whatever it was .
scotch .
whiskey .
whiskey .
in the central ?
part of the country you're right .
if you were sick .
break out the booze .
like here in the northeast it'd probably be like .
whiskey and scotch because .
you know we were doing a lot business with .
scotland and ireland at the time .
and that's pretty much what they make over there .
what should we have for dessert ?
although there are a few good irish beers .
what would you like daddy ?
guiness .
killians .

it's an adult it was a mama bird .
and if in a few weeks it's .
it's going to have .
i don't know how !
many babies .

this quicksand stuff .
but it's not quicksand .
it's muddy too .
it has water in it .
so does the does skip live !
at the sanctuary ?
i don't .
or does his parents just run it ?
he lives !
there .
well that's pretty neat .
and he also has a hou in house in newton but he but he uses the one in cape cod .
so they go there so that's where his parents work ?
what do you mean ?
they they run they run the bird sanctuary .
and they live there sometimes .
and sometimes when i guess during the winter when the sanctuary doesn't needta be taken care of they live at in newton .
okay .
i get it .
i thought they lived in newton too but the address on the sanctuary was cape cod .
so what did you do ?
how was the trip ?
it was fun .

and was it long ?
pretty !
long .

and she said can i come to chi's party and i said and i said i didn't know who .
she was ?
i didn't know her name ?
but i knew she was in your class .
it sounds like that girl .
and .
she laughs !
a lot .
alright .
that could be her .
and .
and her mother .
well she used to have long hair .
i think ?
you've seen her in kindergarten walk by a few times .
i remember .
so you sat with her and who else ?
and elizabeth .
you know her .
so was it a long trip ?
was it boring ?
you didn't you didn't seem to look like you played with any of your stuff on the way down .
i didn't .

we played that .
and !
we all sang in the bus .
what did you sing ?
a song that it's makes no sense .
what song was it ?
the sailor song .
i don't know the name of it so we all call it the sailor song .
how does it go ?
i think you heard it before .
it goes .
a sailor went to sea to see what he .
i know that one .
i used to sing that one when i !
was a kid .
doesn't make any sense !
no it doesn't .
but it's fun it's fun to sing .
it's one of those long bus songs .
i'm amazed you didn't sing the the wheels on the bus .
did you ?
no .
because that's a long bus song too .
well .
i'm glad you had a good time .
okay .
how long did it take you to get down there ?
do you have any idea ?
was it a long long time or a short time ?
two hours or so .
it did ?
that's a long time .
and you all didn't get bored ?
we kept on asking are we almost there .
i bet .
and there's a song !
named are we almost there so we kept on singing are we almost there too .
okay .
how many adults went ?
daniel's father is one .
but skip and his parents went before us so .
i can't count them .
okay .
because they stayed there and waiting for you .
no they went they went the night before .
okay .
and stayed there .
and then in the mor .
in the .
you know .
okay .
daniel's father .
miss marazo .
miss skouth .
mister galley .
miss malone .
and the bus driver .
the bus driver stayed all day in the truck .
he did ?
he didn't get out or anything ?
nope !
i bet he had a sore butt when he !
got home .
well .
so what else did you do ?
where did you have lunch ?
we had lunch on on their on the grassy part .
like like it's sort of like .
like .
th it's shells then you get on a little garden part .
we had lunch there .
that's where we had snack too .
and you had lots of good junk food .
and did the did the other kids bring junk food too ?
when i was a kid i used to love !
field trips .
mostly because .
you didn't have to eat at school and you didn't and you gotta bring a really big lunch .
and a lot !
of it because the bus was hot .
we didn't eat we didn't get to eat anything !
on the bus .
you didn't ?
no .
well .
we were all starving too .
i think part you know one of the best parts of .
going on field trips was eating on the bus .
so that's too bad you didn't get to .
eat on the bus .
well .
went so wh any idea .
what field trips you're going to go on next year ?
no .
this is sort of a test .
it was a test ?
what kind of test ?
was it really ?
who said it was a test ?
miss marazo .
she told us .
well that's interesting .
and she always says when we go anywhere .
be on your best behavior .
alright .
like you .
well i tell you be respectful .
behave .
and be quiet !
well so you might go on some really neat you know trips next year ?
when i get in fifth grade .
we'll take the bus to the gym .
at the upper school .
really ?
they use the gym at the upper school .
that's pretty neat .
and they go on to field trips they went on a one field trip to egypt !
i think or something like that .
did they really ?
for .
two weeks .
that's pretty nice .
not second grade !
no fifth grade i know .
and fifth grade doesn't fifth grade also go like to to new hampshire or something ?
for a couple weeks ?
i don't know .
i think that the science the science department takes them .
and they study plant life and .
it's pretty neat .
there were all kinds of weird birds at the estuary .
sanctuary .
sanctuary it's a bird sanctuary .
that's where birds .
are protected .
and you know no one can hunt them and .
you know .
they just kind of protect them so that they grow and they they have eggs and they roost and do all that .
you know what ?
what ?
there was this rock .
s at in the middle .
of the sea thing .
and we all stepped over it .
all the rock .
and it was a big !
rock so .
we all stepped on all the rocks and we gotta the big rock in the middle .
did you really ?
was it fun ?
did you climb on the rock ?
but there's one !
thing .
because there were three people at on the rock at a time .
there was one !
thing those three people hadta remember .
what's that ?
try not to slip .
well that would .
that's pretty important .
well .
and .
tide came in .
so the rest of the people couldn't get on .
i wonder if those people who were standing on it stayed there ?
if the water would go over their heads ?
no .
no .
well i it i guess it depends on how high .
the high tide gets .
remember that story we saw on the news where that boy went on that rock ?
and it was really low tide and he and his friends were playing on the rock ?
and then the electric plant let out their water because it has .
you know a dam .
it's a hydroelectric plant .
they use water to to .
make energy ?
and they let out their !
water and the all th his friends left him and he got stuck in that big rock with .
you know .
water spewing !
by him really really hard ?
and he couldn't get off .
couldn't he swim ?
no the water was way !
to strong for him to swim .
he would've drowned if he would've jumped into the water so it was really smart of him just to stay !
there .
and his friends went and got help ?
and then at like hours and hours later a helicopter hadta come down and and pick him up ?
he would have drowned .
that water was way to strong for him to swim .
and too deep .
probably .
well i don't even think it was the d even if he could !
swim .
that water was too strong .
i mean that's it's like having a .
a truck !
hit you .
the speed that that water was .
you know being forced at him .
no .
see he was smart just to sit there but i'm sure when he got home he was cold and hungry .
and wet and sore and stiff .
probably very hungry .
well he was there for something like seven hours .
yikes !
he couldn't go anywhere until someone you know .
came to the rescue !
right .
i bet the person who flew the helicopter got a lot of money !
well i think the i think .
people like that .
are paid by the state .
you know because it's like a rescue team .
you know like the fire department .
gets paid by the state .
and the police get paid by the state .
the police station .
right .
i think people who do like .
stuff like that rescuing and in the coast guard .
and he wanted to be called by rescue nine one one .
right .
that's right .
they said he got a lot of telephone calls about being on tv and and doing interviews and stuff .
why ?
i don't know i guess people were interested in him .
i thought he didn't he he wanted to be on rescue nine one one .
that's what he said he would like to do .
why ?
i don't know chi i don't know .
i'd go for any show .
well i guess he just thought it was exciting .
so anyway .
yikes .
mom .
well .
i'm looking forward to second grade .
you're not going into second grade i am .
no .
don't be silly .
i'm looking forward to you !
going in .
and going on new field trips and having new friends and a new teacher .
and learning new stuff .
i know there's two of them right ?
right .
one's young .
one's old and they're both white right ?
no .
one's one's young and the other one's .
pretty young .
i thought she was an older lady .
no .
alright .
one's name is grace .
somebody or other .
i don't know what their names are .
okay .
okay .
well i hope you get a really good teacher that next year .
i've had !
really good teachers so far .
and have lots of fun .
it's weird because i had all girls teachers so far .
you know .
most teachers are .
are usually women .
i think it is just one of those careers that women tend to go into .
and they don't have many men ?
to go into it ?
but i think .
more at the high school and college level you have more men .
teachers than women .
that's when the men start outnumbering the women .
why ?
i don't know .
it's the way it's divided up .
it's it's a long story .
long story .
but if you ask like irene .
how many of her professors are male versus female .
i think she will probably tell you that most of them are male .
i only had one boy assistant .
and that was in kinde kin no that was in preschool .
right that was john .
that's his name ?
his name was john .
i can't think of his last name but sister also !
was a preschool teacher .
so .
and i think they had another sister that was a that was a preschool s teacher so teachers just kind of ran in his family .
you know all of them .
kind of went into that career .
well .
you're right you're lucky .
you had a lot of teachers .
i didn't particularly like miss marazo this year but .
as long as you did .
i guess it was alright .
but i thought louisa was great .
louisa was fun and funny .
and interesting .
you know she asked us to go to mexico with her .
she did ?
they're going down for the month of july i think .
and she said and she well .
sure ?
i don't think we'll be going this !
time but they go down every summer .
so what we might do is make a you know plan to go down one summer with her .
and that would be really nice .
and so she said she's st she's practicing her spanish this summer .
and i told her you and i !
would be practicing ours and maybe what we could do .
is make plans to go down next !
summer .
when our spanish is all polished !
and we will speak like the natives .
what do you think ?
good .
and i think that will be fun .
she sent us that postcard remember ?
yep .
she sent us a postcard last summer .
do they really dress like that all the time ?
no they dress they dress pretty much like you and i do .
they have cars too ?
they have we have chi just like .
boston .
exactly like boston .
how come .
in pictures that's .
because what what you see in pictures usually is what they .
let's see .
what .
their cultural !
dress is .
what their ethnic dress is like when you see .
pictures of africa you see people .
you know wrapped up in in kenda cloth and .
saris and sandals and hair corn rows ?
but we know africans chi that don't dress like that .
we know africans that wear suits .
and ties and high heels and .
you know .
i mean that's their cultural !
dress .
that's their type of .
and they make it look like the place .
looks like an old .
right .
no no some of the villages !
are kept !
in their original state .
but they you know when they were .
a long long time ago .
i thought it looked all sandy and stuff .
well it does .
mexico .
right mexic .
right mexico still does have old buildings .
because now they i mean they're historical .
you've gotta keep them around so people can see what they used to look like .
but they also have houses just like ours .
i'm quite sure they have apartment buildings .
i mean you know .
they don't have many stores .
they ha yes they do chi .
they have hospitals and schools and colleges and .
universities .
i mean they have everything .
you know .
what you see in postcards .
is the historical stuff .
you know the the .
but how do they take pictures of that ?
excuse me ?
i i don't understand .
what's the question ?
the old stuff .
the old stuff .
what about it ?
if they destroyed it all ?
no they didn't destroy it all .
the whole point is chi .
they're keeping it all together .
they're keeping it they're wel how do how do i say this ?
they're .
taking care of it so that people from generations .
on generations can see what it looked like .
you know ?
like if we go into downtown .
right near my office ?
and you see those those brown stones ?
those houses .
made out of brick they're all in a row and they all kind of look alike ?
they're real fancy .
up by beacon hill ?
well anyway .
near the state house and the boston common ?

but you on vacation so any so his time should've been convenient for you !
so he'll be out wednesday ?
how much ?
between nine and eleven .
what between nine and eleven ?
it'll be done in the morning .
how come they can actually look around and see if they can actually find the termite ?
you =?
he probably did male and thought it was flea or something .
it's just a little flea looking bug !
okay so .
we need two of those big lights .
so for a light to be on like this the last thing you need it the light bulb like that up there .
and it say you need two of those for this .
you put those kind of lights and they can last for years without blowing .
a regular light blow will blow .
like solar .
so it's best to have two of those kind up there .
i'd buy just two of those type there .
put in your door .
my door ?
okay .
so you will start cleaning and dusting while you're on vacation ?
i've been thinking it over .
hold on .
i mean that .
the lad the tall ladder down there can get up to the top ones too .
may not be a bad idea .
no .
ain't no what ?
a dog ?
when w we saw it .

there's one there too .
here of all places .
somebody hold the box while the other one shells .
look at it this way .

male's going ?
fix what ?
if that dog lives for ten years is he going to bark in that darn train every day though the years .
mark and them is looking for a fire ?
dog .
well maybe we better flag them down .
alright .
you rub those pieces so he can start sleeping outside every night until the weather get rainy or whatever .
stayed out last night too .
why you don't think we should leave him out at at night or si or something ?
you don't think nobody going to come back here and steal him do you ?
nobody want to steal him .
well he may be good for something in the long run .
when he's outside .
maybe i'll needta buy a sign for one of these days say caution beware of dog .
and put it on the gate right there .
but it'd be nice if he can be in the back yard and roam around a little bit .
no she didn't .
well male anybody ain't .
johnny equipment ?

i'm so happy you up here because i'm going to teach you how to work .

and they .
you always buying something when you have no money .
i think your brains ?

you see that sidewalk over there just the same .
this side of the sidewalk .

garbage man .

the harvard language people are coming to school remember ?
yep !
and you're going to give them this tape after we make it .
it's okay .
we can talk about it .
they've ?
probably talked to mrs brado ?
by now so .
you going to wear the backpack again .
you think ?
probably .
eat your chili too .
don't just eat the bread !
boo .
why don't you want to go to camp ?
because .
i want to spend time with you .
if i go to camp i'll i'll have .
you'll not time with me .
what if you just went to camp a little bit ?
not every day but just part of the .
like maybe a couple weeks ?
still boo .
you don't think you'll want to go at all ?
no .
you had a good time last year though .
that was small frye .
are you worried because you're going into the bigger kid's camp ?
what are you worried about ?
because i know !
most of the kids in small frye .
and i don't and .
ask cara ?
and some other kids if they were going and they said .
well you know what ?
the kids that were in small frye last year .
are getting bigger now .
just like you are so they're probably going to be in the big kids camp this year too .
not everybody that you went to small frye with you is going to go again this year but a lot of the kids will and they'll be in the bigger kids camp .
because they all turn seven this year too .
stephanie's eight and she's !
in first grade .
some kids stay back a year .
no she's not a stay back .
well is she going to camp ?
i don't know but she was there last year !
at camp .
well i think you're going to know a lot of the kids .
and they're all going to be your age it's not like they're going to be .
you know .
a lot older than you .
they're going to be your age and they're going to be all from beverly .
and .
a lot of them will be from either the ymca or from the edwards .
and you know the teachers .
noelle will probably be there and ward .
no .
ward works in small frye .
noelle works out of the beverly school for the deaf camp .
but she worked with you as guys last summer .
remember you did swimming with her ?
she still works as small frye .
and jimmy .
works at a small frye and .
so what do you think camp is going to be like this year ?
what ?
why ?
what do you think it's going to be like ?
probably just because when we went when we went h for a nature walk .
went by first graders and they hadta play and they were playing basketball and stuff .
i don't like .
basketball ?
basketball's fun !
you know .
the thing is i think that in the big kid's camp .
they do a lot of the same stuff .
nature walks and arts and crafts .
no .
they don't .
do nature walks .
sure they do !
everybody does nature walks at camp .
that's part of being in camp .
it's like a rule !
of camp .
you have to do nature walks .
you're doing mine !
you want two ?
who ate my la my other piece ?
i don't know .
did you ?
i don't think it was these other seventeen people that are sitting at the table with us .
what ?
well .
i don't you know i don't think you have anything to worry about .
the big kid's camp is going to be a lot the same as the small frye camp .
but i don't want to go to camp wanawassa ?
do you know how to pronounce it ?
camp wanawassa ?
no !
i don't think so .
it begins with a .
i can't pronounce it though .
it's a fancy indian name .
tatawassa ?
it's called .
you have to work for rella .
well .
i have to decide whether i want to work for rella ?
and then .
she said yes .
no .
but listen !
what about you and whitney ?
because if i'm going to take care of whitney and erin all summer long .
it's going to be you me .
whitney and erin .
every day .
all day .
and you and whitney sometimes don't get along .
and this wouldn't be .
you want some more juice ?
yes .
well do you say that ?
my my neck is burning .
thank you .
thank you .
so what i'm saying is you and whitney have a hard time getting along sometimes even when you just play over each other's houses .
and i think you needta think about .
do you want to spend your entire !
summer with whitney every !
single !
day .
because that's when it's going to be .
i mean every day chi .
why can't we just skip camp ?
this doesn't really have anything to do with camp .
i'm saying if you stay home from camp regardless of camp what i'm saying is that if you stay home from camp and you stay with me this summer .
then i'm going to be taking care of erin and .
whitney and .
but erin always helps us solve our problems .
i know that but what about you and whitney ?
you guys argue all the time .
but when erin's there .
she helps us .
she's like superhero .
she's nice ?
well .
i guess i'm just a little bit concerned because i would like to have some time just you and me !
this summer without being with everybody else also .
so we can do some of the stuff we talked about doing .
i know .
i know .
so .
i'm trying to figure out rella's going to want us to start taking care of the kids .
right when school ends .
which means you wouldn't get any time just with you and me .
it would be you and me and erin and whitney everyday .
which one way would be good .
i mean you'd have kids to play with .
we could go and do things .
we've got lot of good ideas about what we could do but you and whitney would be able to would have to have to be able to get along this summer and work out your problems .
we probably will .
i mean i guess i haven't been around the two of you enough to see how much you fight .
is it a lot ?
no .
only like one or two fights a day .
last time we had no fights .
what do you guys usually argue about ?
who gets to be yellow .
who gets to be the car .
what do you mean who gets to be yellow ?
on .
and who gets to be the car and dog and stuff on monopoly .
junior .
so you guys fight about games ?
and sometimes we fight .
like .
we don't we .
i don't know what we fight about .
we just fight about stuff .
wa once i went over witney's and we didn't even have a one .
and not even a half of a .
fight .
not even a one second fight .
well that's good .
but that was only one day .
so i wanted to find out what you wanted to do .
i guess our three choices are .
we could have the kids with us all summer .
and have some more money .
we could not have the kids with us and not have any money .
or we .
or you could go to camp .
if we work if we work for rella .
could i go to .
kung chi's karate class for a couple couple days .
a week ?
that's actually a really good idea !
that that you could like we could have a break from fighting and stuff .
that's an excellent idea .
erin might also be taking music classes that i would have to drive her to .
but that's a really really good idea .
chi because if you were taking karate lessons every day you could go to the karate studio for a couple hours and that would give you a break from whitney for awhile .
that's a very !
good idea .
and i could learn how to defend myself like if i get scared from dad and stuff .
you want to do that now .
take those lessons ?
aye aye .
i think that's a .
just really really good idea .
i'm glad you thought of that .
that's a good way to break up the day .
is there any other lessons or stuff that you want to do this summer ?
art lessons !
art lessons .
where at ?
i don't know .
do you know if jenny's going to art school this summer ?
has she mentioned it to you ?
no !
wait .
i want to play .
this year if i go into the farm league i want to play .
okay ?
well .
the thing is i think that little league stops when school stops .
and i don't think they have little league during the summer and then it starts up again in the fall .
but don't they have farm league ?
they do have farm league but i think it also ends at the end of the school year .
but we're going to but me but larry's going to turn us into the farm league .
right ?
well .
you needta speak with your coach about that and i will also because he had just mentioned to me that you and his son kevin .
right ?
you and kevin .
might be ready to move up to the farm league by the end of the season because you guys are doing real well and you're the big kids on the team .
but why don't you ask him about that at practice on thursday okay ?
you still have a ways to go .
you've only had you're first game .
but anyway .
they don't have little league in the summer .
are you eating your chili ?
i ate most of it !
you're doing good .
okay .
chi you shoulda seen the size of this wedding !
cake that i went to last night at this wedding i went to .
was the wedding cake like one mile high ?
it was huge .
it was humongous !
humongous !
i shoulda i didn't get a good look at it but .
i was really far away but you could still see it from the other side of the room .
it was like one .
two .
three cakes like this and then stairs .
chi look !
stairs came up like this onto another cake and then the stairs came up onto another cake and there were little a bride and a groom .
here comes the bride .
all all fat and wide .
here comes .
what is it called ?
just go ahead !
okay ?
chi they want to hear you talking while that tape recorder's on !

here comes the .
groom .
all all skinny as a broom .

i forgot what happens the rest of it !
so the bride is fat and wide .
the groom is skinny as a broom .
the maid we don't know about .
and who else ?
that's all .
what other songs do you have at school ?
well fran used to sing a song .
fran your teacher ?
and the boys used to sing down goes the gay ship instead of the gray ship .
and then they and then they say .
then after that they say .
fishes and turtles and women lost their bras .

they say women lost their bras !

that's all but there's something really funny .
your cheeks are all pink .

store that this artists's co-op .
right .
runs like every christmas time and they sell their crafts and stuff .
anybody if they want to .
but then we went into this other place .
which was .
the children's gallery .
and it had like .
things for children like accessories and .
you know .
they didn't really sell them .
so mary said .
and mary said .
well actually i'm just you know and .
so maybe she might do some baby quilts and bring them in .
she should !
that would be really !
good .
because it wouldn't take her .
eight months to do it .
well .
well .
right .
and at this christmas store we saw this quilt that was like they were asking twelve fifty for it .
it was a wall hanging .
it wasn't even like a for a bed !
or anything .
right .
and it was was .
ugly and it was not as even as well done as the ones that she's making .
no i .
well she she hasta .
set aside more time .
get organized .
i'm going to tell her .
you know actually i think she's on welfare .
i'm going to tell her that she really ought to think about making baby quilts =?
clothes .

you have to start writing .
mom !
it can be really short .
just like inv said .
it could be one sentence .
one !
just one word then .
one sentence .
word .
or it could be really silly .
you could write something a little bit crazy .
you could ?
write something to the turtle .
you could you could write to the turtle and ask him a joke .
or you know .
i mean .
he could never read it .
this is not like a school paper or test or anything .
right .
doesn't matter how it looks .
this is like you know .
the world has turned upside down .
it's whatever you want to write .
right .
or you could write to the one of the birds .
well you said you wanted to change larry's name .
i know !
because larry we found was .
hunhunh .
i didn't .
say that .
because it has a blue beak .
that means they're female .
i didn't know that .
me neither .
i didn't i didn't either .
the color of the beak ?
the little .
piece above the beak ?
that little where the nose is .
is blue .
blue means they're a girl .
i didn't ever know that ?
i had no idea !
that's the only way you can tell .
the coloring .
it was larry bird .
that's so cute !
larry's mother .
no i didn't i didn't .
change his name yet .
i know .
so you can't make him .
you can make up a joke .
you know why i named him larry bird ?
why ?
because there's a basketball !
player named larry bird !
well write that ?
no !
i don't want to !
i don't want to write anything .
how about .
just writing something .
like what your name is .
refers to the pencil which is dull .
did the pencil work ?
i got a pencil .
i'll !
sharpen it .
use the sharpener .
now ?
which ?
sharpener ?
i think it's on top of the bed .
do you want me to get it ?
bet it is .

hope it sharpens !
these kinds of pencils .
me too .
yup .
sounds like it's working hard .
anything ?
it's too old .
it's like ten years old .

it's working hard .
it is working hard .
but sometimes it gets .
its times off ?
when i'm done i'll ask you the question .

that's a capital ?
comma .
what's that ?

let me see .

starts with the same place you have a .
god .
like this .

you have to write .
and then we put the comma .
right ?
dear brian .
do you have an eraser ?
how do you spell ?
capital .
don't write messy .
write it the way you know you can .
here's an eraser .
okay .

write it write it neat so he can read it chi .
okay ?
what's that ?
you erased part of the .
why don't you fix it ?
okay .
you don't have to write fast because they'll they'll wait for you to do it .
now you put the comma .
and you put it you start it .
the same place you start a period .
where do you put the period ?
here .
very good .
good .
dear brian .
now .
down here ?
you want to start .
see where the is ?
wait .
wait .
no .
what are you doing ?
saying .
to who ?
chris .
we're going to write the letter now .
you want to write to all of them in one letter ?
okay why don't we write all their names .
right after .
like dear brian .
chris and nicholas .
how about that it will save space ?
no ?
dear .
how do you spell ?
same as you .
okay .
now you want to .
do it .
christopher .
dear christopher .
now .
very nice .
dear .
nicholas .
he spells it .
nikki .
that's right .
now .
you want to put the comma in the same place .
now put the comma .
in the same place you did for brian .
after and then .
well he spells it that way .
but that's how he !
spells it .
okay .
even though sometimes it sounds a different way .
a person likes to spell it the way they like to spell it .
so that's how we wrote it .
okay you want to to put a comma .
after their names ?
yes .
okay now you write the letter part .
right ?
what letter part ?
the part you want to tell them .
like you know about your new school or your new teacher or friends .
what's that ?
because you haven't seen them in a while .
look that .
look .
look what you wrote .
can you read it to me ?
dear brian .
dear christopher .
dear .
nikki .
okay good .
next time we write that we write to all of them do you think there's an easier way to do it ?
what ?
can you think of one ?
no .
instead of saying three times ?
how else can you write that ?
dear brian .
christopher .
and nikki .
right ?
we can write once .
and then we'll save all save that space .
okay ?
dear brian and chris and christopher and nikki .
right .
so next time we'll do it like that okay ?
and it'll save a little time .
okay now what do you want to tell them ?
you can tell brian you've seen nikki but brian and christopher what what do you want to say ?
like if you were on the phone right now and you were talking to them what would you say ?
you'd say instead of but .
what would you say ?
how do you spell ?
capital .
you know what ?
start in a little bit .
because when you start the sentence .
after you write .
you write in .
right here .
just a little bit more .
that will do it .
wait .
put it .
see where this w this starts ?
you want to put it in a little bit .
okay ?
wait .
because this .
what ?
dear .
what are you doing ?
i'm writing .
why ?
you gotta write the letter chi .
dear lauren .
no .
that's okay .
yep .
you gotta write the letter part .
okay you finished that part .
we'll write la lauren afterwards .
now you put you start the sentence a little bit .
farther in like the second letter in from dear okay ?
okay .
can you do that ?
so where do you start the ?
where you going to put the ?
no .
what did i just say ?
you put it in .
one letter in at least from the .
so you start it below the .
okay ?
how come you start below the ?
because .
that's just the way that it works .
it's called .
you indent it a little bit .
out so that way they know it's the beginning of of your letter .
okay ?
okay .
capital .
it's the first one .
first letter of the sentence right ?
do you know how to make a s a lower case capital ?
capital .
yep .
you can just .
put the line high and what does it say ?
how do you spell ?
what does it sound like ?
say it .
say the word .
no say the word .
hi .
hi .
what's the last sound ?
i don't want to sound it out .
what's the last sound ?
it's really easy .
just close your eyes for a second and think about it .
why .
then you'll get it .
hi .
good .
that's right .
and then you want to put an exclamation point ?
do you know what that means ?
what does it mean ?
no that's not how you do it .
who taught you to do that ?
that's nice but you know what you want to do ?
hi .
you want to make sure that point is the same place where your period would be .
so you start it .
way up here .
okay ?
so they go up there .
okay ?
yep .
okay .
now what else do you want to say ?
hi .
chris .
hi !
how about saying something else because you already got their names up there .
they know that you're talking to them .
say hi .
how are you or .
how do you spell how are you ?
or i miss you or .
how do you spell i miss you ?
well .

i was talking to ross about .
he was actually he was asking me who is my .
let's see .
who in my family liked me the most , was i the most fa favorite of .
or something like that .
and i said ".
well my mother .
and then i said ".
well .
no he said ".
and i said ".
no , well my father .
and then he said ".
i remember .
you told me once that you had your father wrapped around your finger .
or ".
you had your dad wrapped around your finger little finger .
you had your dad wrapped around your little finger .
and this is true .
but the thing is i can't remember how long ago that was .
it was really quite a long time ago .
i think it was at the beginning of this year sometime or at least at the beginning of the school year .
but anyway he remembered it and he remembered how to say it also .
i heard mark say ".
we don't want no soap in the water .
and ross said back to him ".
mark .
it's we don't want any soap in the water .
mark you have disgusting language .
and mark said ".
i just made a mistake , ross .
i gave mark a drink of water because he wasn't quite g .
well he was still awake in bed and i went in there and he asked me for a drink of water .
so he finished the water and he said ".
thank you , mom .
the more i drink , the more eat .
with little hand movements .
the more faster i fall asleep .
mark was having trouble with reading some books that we got him and ross mark said ".
it's because the the words are too little .
and and ross said ".
the reason he can't read it is because he can't see the words on the page .
so my suggestion is that when he wants to read the words you write them up on a on a piece of paper so that he can see them .
and what was interesting about that was this ".
my suggestion is .
mark's suggestion is .
business is was well used .
it was like part of a general solution to a problem that everybody was facing at this point .
actually mark's causing us all a lot of problems right now .
he's sort of being a little bit difficult , let's say .
ross that he was just mister wonderful just like when he was a baby .
he said ".
mister wonderful the wrestler ?
no , no .
and then he said ".
there is !
such a guy .
in other words , that's the first use of in that sense that i'd ever in that specific sense that i'd ever noticed .

the ugly old emperor .
he's going to take you and he's going to turn you into one of his minions .
nuhhuh you know why ?
he they that's just a movie .
it's just a movie .
it's a movie about what's going to happen in this world in the future .
marky said ".
these are the twin boys and they go diagonally .
diagonally ?
mary said ".
and he said ".
that doesn't mean they go straight .
and he hadta he was referring to some pictures in a you know in a in from his class portraits where all the kids' pictures were out all put out together and they were indeed diagonally arranged .
mark asked me ".
daddy what did the volcanoes erupt after ?
and i said ".
after the earth was born .
and he asked me ".
what did they have to erupt for ?
they hadta erupt because it was very hot inside the earth .
ross i i want you to come right now „ ross .
baby monkey ?
very good now sit down and eat .
you should see him in his bed .
with his mommy .
he's in his bed with his mommy .
now marky asked me about why did the vol volcanoes have to erupt „ ross .
what do you do you know about that ?
what ?
marky asked why did the volcanoes have to erupt .
because the earth was too warm inside .
no the earth was making land .
that's true but marky had the right answer .
that's how they made land but that's not why they made land .
there's another thing that i want to tell you about .
it's not very polite at the table though .
the earth was full of gas .
so ?
hadta burp .
burp ?
that's what volcanoes are .
it's when the earth is burping .
really volcanic eruptions are caused largely by gas .
hot gas .
now that's not true of lava flows but when they actually blow i think .
actually it's a little more complicated than that .
but gas really is involved .
more „ please .
see there's pressure inside .
pressure inside the earth .
because it's very hot inside , did you know that ?
you know about the devil ?
do you think he's real ?
unhunh .
unhunh .
he's not real .
how do we know he's not real ?
because you have to be underground .
because that's where mud ?
is .
he would have to live underground .
and they know that he can't live there .
why ?
why can't he ?
it's too hot .
and there's mud .
first it gets muddy and then after .
it's too hot .
he'd burn up .
nothing could survive .
nothing .
it is so .
not not even him .
the only thing even the rocks turn to to gas .
even i'm not kidding .
to lava they turn to .
liquid .
liquid they turn to liquid .
they melt .
can i have some more cornbread „ please ?
they what$v ?
can i be excused „ please ?
no not yet .
you haven't had enough to eat .
you're not finished .
i'm full .
you're going .
your mouth is full .
okay .
now ross let's go back to what happened in the beginning .
do you think the oldest thing is when the earth was began ?
no .
unhunh .
want to know what the very first thing was , according to scientists ?
first the big .
what is it called ?
planet blew up .
it's called the big .
dipper .
no you're close .
the big .
bang .
that's the beginning .
in the world was the big bang .
what's the big bang ?
that's how the world started with a bang .
that's what scientists say .
to come closer .
no it was all the world was compressed into very small space , so tiny that noone could stand it .
there weren't any people .
all there were were molecules and pieces of matter .
everything in the whole world was compressed very tight „ okay ?
and it got so tight that it went !
„ okay ?
and it blew everything out into the world , dus stardust all over the world .
and then .
i thought there wasn't any world then .
then all the stardust came together and formed planets and stars and started to cool .
it was very hot .
so there is !
such thing as stardust .
my teacher keeps saying there isn't any .
stardust .
she doesn't understand what you mean by stardust .
she thinks you mean romance .
what's that ?
stardust like what ?
sandman .
what rainbow brite .
those ?
you know that stardust that she springs into life ?
i can't .
hate that ?
i'm stuffed .
okay you're excused .
bye bye now .
did you finish your milk „ ross ?
i can't eat .
i can't eat that .
that's alright .
you did a very good job „ mark .
with little with little crumbs .
okay .
with little crumbs ?
lots of little crumbs .
lots of them .
lots of ?
have you ever seen the dust ?
little balls of fluff and fuzz ?
but marky i mean how could teeny things , how could they form a big world with lots of little crumbs ?
under the what$n ?
under the bed ?
all the dust .
some fluffy stuff .
under the bed ?
you know you know what that's made of ?
what ?
dust and crumbs .
matter .
and it all clings together .
made of matter .
you mean it got dried and then it sort of ?
clings together .
it joins hands .
do you want do you want me to tell you something really surprising ?
what ?
you know what your body is made of ?
what ?
bones .
but everything .
the bones are made of .
you know you know you know what else it's made of ?
matter .
it's made of matter .
what is your blood made out of ?
matter .
stuff .
is what is your eyeballs made of ?
stuff .
matter .
what is your ?
the whole world is made of matter .
the whole world .
little pieces of stuff .
there are different things that are called elements .
matter is in different types of elements .
pancakes ?
fluoro what ?
pancakes ?
pancakes are made of carbohydrates .
they're they're a union of carbon atoms , oxygen atoms , and hydrogen atoms .
like oxygen .
oxygen is one you breathe .
you breathe .
and nitrogen is in the air too „ nitrogen .
argon , xenon , those are sort of rare .
but that stuffie ?
in the on the ground , gravity , it keeps you down .
but in space there's no gravity so you go up and down like that .
right that's right .
and in space there's no air to breathe , no oxygen , no nitrogen .
so you need a little spacesuit on .
how do you get to breathe with a spacesuit on ?
got a bunch of oxygen on your back .
in a tank full of .
in a l all stuffed together real tight .
a bottle full of .
bottle of oxygen .
but how do you eat with taking off your helmet ?
don't take it off .
you'll die .
well how do you get to eat that way ?
wait until you get back into your into your spaceship .
then you can eat .
in the spaceship .
when you get in your spaceship then it's safe .
it s has air in it .
because because you have to open the spaceship when you're going up in space .
right .
how'd you learn that ?
so in when you open the thingie , air comes in .
right .
how did you learn about that ?
i just i didn't learn about it .

she says .
we're .
voted you in and .
you .
let me see that for a second .
we're voted you in .
and .
you sold out !
you sold out .
and that's the end of the story ?
and .
well .
that's the what .
the main .
idea is like .
yes .
okay .
now .
who did who did lucy want to win ?
linus .
linus .
okay .
linus did !
win .
yes .
but how about the other kids ?
did they want charlie to win ?
thinking .
you mean linus .
he was the only one he ran against this other kid .
not charlie brown .
but russell .
russell ?
this kid named russell .
yes ?
i see .
okay .
what else .
do you want me to do .
dad ?
okay .
let's see .
so .
did let's see if there's anything else in this story .
russell anderson .
what happened to russell anderson ?
he lost .
he lost ?
well there was only one more person that forgot that did that didn't !
vote !
but how many candidates were there how many people .
and that !
was russell himself !
and so how many .
no one voted for what ?
he !
did !
russell himself .
thought linus would be better than him .
yes .
russell wasn't the only person !
it was .
close .
thirty eight and eight three to eight three .
i see .
russell broke the tie !
now what did do you what is it that made .
eighty three to eighty four .
what is it that made linus lose ?
he won !
who won ?
but how come .
linus !
linus won ?
but what did linus say that was stupid ?
he said ".
instead of boring you with .
speech .
i would i'll say a few words about the great pumpkin .
and then they all .
yes .
because .
and they thought it was funny .
right .
okay .
but you know something ?
what ?
did you how many votes did did russell get ?
thirty eight .
eighty three .
eighty three .
and how many did linus get ?
eighty four !
eighty four !
just one extra one .
okay .
so russell from russell .
so it was a tie .
right ?
that was called a .
it was !
a tie unless .
unless okay .
until when russell .
broke the tie !
yes .
okay .
so what is linus can linus fix the lockers ?
well .
said !
he would .
well .
at the end he said he really .
couldn't do .
anything all those things he said he would !
do .
he couldn't do them .
right ?
right .
what did he think he was going to do ?
he said .
well the well the .
principal is still !
the boss of the school .
right .
and so he can't do it .
now what about all the parts in the beginning .
when they have trouble with their stupid lockers ?
that's with .
lucy .
i mean .
that's not so interesting .
sally .
sally .
i think you're right .
so you want to tell the whole story again .
one more time ?
no .
let's tell it one more time so daddy will listen to it .
come on !
cause you have to do a real good job when you're up there in front of the class .
read it from the book !
well .
i think .
what's the most funny part of the story ?
i think it's when linus talks about the great pumpkin .
let me see .
i think its when linus talks .
and also what does lucy do to get people to vote for linus ?
well .
i think that was funny !
what did she do ?
she pull that kid by his shirt and yanked !
him !
you ought to tell them about that .
okay ?
okay .
okay .
tell them about that .
so what are you going to say ?
how did lucy get people to vote for for her brother ?
yanked one !
kid .
and what did she do with the other kids ?
the .
next ?
kid .
yanked him by his collar .
she said she the first kid she yanked him by the collar !
but the second kid .
she asked him .
and he said ".
sure .
i'd vote for anybody that .
shared their lunch with me .
because he forgot his lunch .
and one day linus .
had been good .
to him .
and what of the other kids .
what'd she do to them ?
but russell anderson said ".
i'm running against him .
so he wasn't voting .
but he ended up voting for him anyway .
okay .
so that's the funny part is when and the other funny part is when linus says instead of giving a speech .
he's going to tell them about the great pumpkin .
that's it ?
and that made him lose a lot of votes .
don't you think ?
well .
then he gained them back .
then because all the kids .
thought it was funny .
say !
he's a pretty good comedian chameleon .
he's a pretty good comedian .
or whatever .
comedian .
or whatever .
and because what did lucy say ?
that's the worst speech i ever heard !
now i know !
we're going to win !
yes .
and they did !
right .
okay .
okay .
well that sounds good !
let's turn it off .
let's turn it off .

and then when he gets it when he brings avc it back , he like wants ic to play chase with it .

my dad .
do you have a chess rating ?

that's okay .
do you have a chess coach or a teacher that you play with ?
at school we have ic this little thing on wednesdays that we call rc chess club after school .

yes .
is it a him or a her ?
it is ic a he .
and his name is ic dave and .
he teaches ic us a lot about chess .
sometimes he let us ic us play .
and sometimes he gives ic us a lesson .
what types of things does he teach you when he gives you lessons ?
like how to fork and how to pin .
and how do you do that ?
like if if my rook is avc here and my king is avc here and your pawn is avc here and you want to attack avc a piece but you can't ic because this one is pinning avc to the king .
and it has to protect ic it so it can't move avc .
that is ic called pinning .
that is ic pinning because the rook is protecting avc the king .
and it can not move ic .
and what was the other thing you said ?
forking .
and how do you do that ?
like when you move avc a piece and you are able to get ic two pieces .
you can attack ic two pieces .
and the other person can only move ic one .
so i get to keep ic the other .
that sounds like a good move .
how many times a week do you think you play chess ?
lots of times .
i can hardly even count them ic .
is it more than five times ?
hum .
so you play at home too and not just at school ?
hum .

and the queen can go ic anywhere .
are there any others ?
tell me about the goals of chess .
what are the players trying to do ?

can you tell me about the rules that players need to follow ?
in other words tell me everything you can think of about the game so that someone who has never played before would know how to play .
my mom has not played ic for a while .
but she knows ic how to play .
let's say you are teaching me how to play .
what sorts of things do i need to know ?
like how to fork and how to pin .
and how to checkmate .
what is checkmate ?
when the king is being attacked avc and he can't move ic anywhere because all the squares are being controlled avc by other pieces .
so if your king was in a checkmate you would lose ?
hum .
is that the only way you can lose ?
what would a player do in order to win a game of chess ?
what are some key strategies a player should use ?
to fork and to pin and to attack i think ic .
is there anything else that you can think of ?
try to get your pieces to the center .
okay .
is there anything else that you should try to do ?
not really .
how long does it take to play a game of chess ?
maybe a half an hour .
what makes a game last a long time ?
by like not taking very many pieces .
and not being able to attack very many pieces .
what do you think would make that happen ?
unintelligible .
what would make a game end really quickly , or be really short ?
like taking ic all the pieces really quickly .

the chess thing .
it has ic a computer in it .
so you can play ic against the computer .
can you name any famous chess players ?
i do not know any ic .
do you ever play chess on a computer .
can you tell me a little more how you play on the computer .
so it is ic like a chess board .
but it has ic a computer in it .
and it can give ic you hints .
and when you get avc someone it makes ic some sound effects like you are nom fighting with swords .
it is really funny ic .
so the chess board has a computer in it ?
so it is not on a computer , a regular computer .
no .
so you move a piece and then what happens .
so the numbers and letters , like four there is two ic .
so it says ic them when you push avc them .
so you ic know .
and when it wants avc to move some place , it tells ic you .
and it tells ic you if there was nom any illegal move , checkmate .
so you are moving the pieces for the computer too , it tells you .
okay .
and this is ic stalemate and a lot of other things .
that sounds like fun .
there is ic a battle screen that shows rc .
it gives ic you hints .
it shows ic where they could move nom .
it is ic really cool .
it shows ic where you should move nom or where the other player should move nom .
it shows ic where you can get nom someone when you push avc it down and look on the battle screen .
they can show ic places where you can move nom .
they are like hints .
and you can press ic this button that says rc move .
and it will move ic for you .
so it decides where to go when you are really stumped .
do you use that button very often ?
no .
now tell me why you enjoy chess .
i do not really know ic why i enjoy nom chess .
do you enjoy puzzles in general ?
but chess is ic easier than puzzles .
sometimes we don't know why we like certain things , we just like it .
okay , so i am not too familiar with the game of chess and you probably know a lot more about it than i do .
so i would like you to explain some things to me .
first of all , how many people may play a game of chess at one time .
two .
i have heard of simultaneous matches , do you know what that is ?
no .
no .
okay , tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move .
there is ic a rook .
they can move ic up or down , left to right .
and there is ic the knight .
they can move ic in l shape .
they go ic one , two and over .
and the king they can move ic only one space in any direction .
pawns can move ic two squares .
and when they are avc attacking someone , they go ic diagonally one space .
and there is ic the queen .
they move ic like diagonally up and down , left and right .
there is ic bishop that moves rc diagonally .
and that is ic all .
now tell me the goals of chess .
what are the players trying to do ?
they are trying ic to get the king in check .
and that means ic like if you like go avc diagonally you can get nom him .
you can go ic anyway to get him .
and if you get avc him in check and he can not move avc any other place , then it is ic checkmate .
and that is a good thing for you .
now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
in other words , tell me everything that you can think about the game of chess so that someone who has never played before , could play the game .
like do or don't need to know .
the rules that need to be followed .
like if we had a chess board here , how would you teach me the rules .
i would show ic you where they can nom move and help you play .
and you are ic going to do this thing called castle king .
if your king and rook are avc near each other , and there is nothing ic .
i forgot ic what i was going to say nom .
you were going to explain something about the rook and the king .
, if there is avc nothing in between them , you can move ic the king .
you skip ic one space .
and you move ic it there .
and your rook moves ic to the other side of your king .
why would you do that .
like if they were picking avc on you on one side so you can move ic over on the other .
now i would like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess .
in other words , what are some key strategies that every good player should know ?
find ic a place where no one could get you nom .
then you move ic a rook and another rook .
but there is ic one space in between .
that is ic where their king is nom .
and then you get ic your queen down the middle of them .
and then it will be ic checkmate because it is avc like three rooks and they can avc move side ways .
so they can not move ic anyway .
and then the game would be ic over .
so your king is between the two rooks or the other person's king .
the other person's king .
and the queen is ic in between the two rooks .
you are trapping the king .
do you have a name to that strategy .
no .
did you make up that strategy yourself ?
did you ?
it sounds like a pretty good one .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
may be forty five minutes .
what makes a game last a long time ?
plenty of open spaces to move and you have ic a lot of good pieces .
okay that makes the game last a long time .
what makes the game end quickly ?
if you play ic bad make bad moves .
if you do a bad move avc and the other person gets avc you it is ic really hard for you to win .
and your queen is ic the most powerful one like a bishop and a rook .
do you know how to use a chess clock .
no .
is there anything else you can think about the game of chess you want to tell me ?
i think ic i told nom you everything .

no .
now tell me why you enjoy chess .
i do not know , it is ic fun .
i'm not too familiar with the game of chess .
you probably know a lot more about it than i do .
so i'd like you to explain some things to me .
first of all , how many people may play a game of chess at one time ?
four .
i've heard of simultaneous matches .
tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move .
so , the rooks move ic like this each one one space .
do they go straight ahead or diagonal ?
not diagonal , like this .
like an l shape .
and bishops can go ic diagonal .
and on your first move with a pawn , you can go ic two spaces or one space .
but the rest you have to go ic one .
your first move you can move two spaces ?
, one time .
and kings one space any direction .
and the queen all through the board any direction .
the little short pieces ?
alright and knights can jump ic other pieces .
now tell me about the goals of chess .
in other words , what are the players trying to do ?
capture the king and checkmate .
now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
in other words , tell me everything you can think of about the game of chess so that someone who has never played before would know how to play .
and so if you touch a piece you have ic to play .
that is ic all i can think of right now .
those are pretty important rules aren't they ?
now i would like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess .
in other words , what are some key strategies that every good player should know ?
if you get avc your pawn down to the other side , you have to get ic a piece .
but it doesn't it cannot be ic a pawn .
or it cannot be ic a king .
if you get avc your pawn down to the other side without being taken , you can get ic another queen .
and you can have ic two queens on the board .
is that a good strategy ?
and if you do not lose avc any of your pawns and you get them all down , you can .
and if you if you get avc a pawn down and you can flip one of the rooks over and that is ic a queen .
and you get another one down you can flip another rook over and then you got two queens .
you get and then you get ic all seven pawns down you can have ic eleven queens .
is that great ?
but with two or one then you get ic checkmate .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
if an inexperienced player is avc playing , five minutes ic .
and an experienced player is ic playing it can go ic up to four hours at least .
what makes a game last a long time ?
not winning his pieces .
cause if you are avc winning his pieces , then it gets ic done fast .
what makes a game end quickly be short ?
you lose your pieces very ic quickly .
and if you up pieces , avc you should start trading ic .
trading ?
so you should do ic that if you are avc ahead of the game .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
child nods head .
tell me about it .
if it is your turn avc and you make a move , you have to hit ic the clock .
so then it will ic pop up a light or pop up something that will tell the other player .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess ?
en passant .
what is that ?
that is when you are ic in fifth rank .
and a pawn is here ic and another pawn here .

or see what she's doing .
okay .
is it being nosy ?
and she doesn't even notice him .
she doesn't ?
so he's being secretive about it ?
or .
where are they ?
in a lab .
and or it could be her pets .
maybe .
could be too .
but i don't think she'd have a pet octopus .
why not ?
because they live in water .
and for some reason he's not in water .
could you keep an octopus in your bathtub ?
it might be too big .
what did ?
what do people do in labs ?
they create and inventions .
and .
but she looks like a kid .
which is .
have you ever done an experiment before ?
like what ?
i forget .
because it was a while ago .
but .
i've done one before .
anything else you see in this picture ?
no ?
alright we'll go to our last picture .
there are a bunch of vegetables .
and one's giant .
and there are a bunch of slugs trying to get the vegetables it looks like .
and she's .
and looks like she's picking the vegetables .
an .
but it looks like they're all radishes .
and there's a fence around them that doesn't stop the slugs .
and she has a shovel .
ope .
i think you got a little friend .
there you go .
is that better ?
and her hair's in a ponytail so it must be .
wait hold on .
hhhot .
there we go .
okay .
her hair's in a ponytail so it must be hot .
it's hot outside you think ?
and she's wearing .
so because her hair's in a ponytail .
so it looks like it's hot .
and another clue that it's hot is there's no snow .
and vegetables don't usually grow in the winter .
so it might be spring .
and .
i think the slugs are looking at the giant radish .
and i think that the slugs are thinking that they want the radish .
and .
i think that the slugs are also going after the smaller ones .
because there are a lot more of them .
and she .
i think she's carrying that ha the radish to her house .
so that she can make soup .
and .
have you ever gardened before ?
what ?
have you ever gardened before ?
how do you do that ?
well i thought .
i thought i foun .
i found a a garlic thing .
and .
that was near the compost bin .
and there were a bunch of garlic on it .
so i planted them .
because they were already starting to grow .
so i planted them .
and i haven't checked on them lately .
so i'm not sure how they're doing but .
i planted them in the spring .
cool .

my mom thought that it was a good idea for me to learn survival .
but it really was just talking about like god and natural disasters .
i want to learn about real survival so mom went to a survival class .
i didn't though .
for two days and the weekend .
and i went to my nana's for that two days .
and she learned so much stuff .
so much .
what kind of stuff ?
how to eat like normal non-poisonous plants .
like honeysuckle .
oo .
you can drink from honeysuckle .
that's cool .
especially out in the country where we live .
we live in the country where there's a lot nature, honey suckle, and a lot of fleabane sometimes .
a lot .
of fleabane .
well you finished this section .
you know what that means ?
hit some buzzers .
and now i'm going to .
guess which one .
what a beautiful orchestra .
i love it .
now we're going to start this one .
and then when we're done with that you can hit it for the final time .
it's going to be so awesome .
ready to start the next one ?
alright .
this, for this section i'm going to show you some pretty crazy pictures .
and i want you to just .
guess .
tell me what you see .
so what's going on in this picture ?
what can you see ?
if someone cuts his oxygen tank there is a one hundred percent chance dead .
why is that ?
why is he carrying a notebook ?
well where is he ?
in space .
that seems to be weird planets that match with his notebook .
why are there two earths ?
i don't know .
why are there two saturns ?
i don't know .
why are there many of these weird things ?
why do you think ?
i don't know .
i guess the planets have multiplied .
maybe .
would you ever go into space ?
i'm actually want to grow up to be a space scientist .
really ?
what made you want to do that ?
that is so cool .
to see if there's actually isn't infinite space .
which i know there can't be an end to space .
there has to be an end to space .
there has to be an end to everything .
that is so cool .
you're going to be an awesome scientist .
and why do person still believe that earth is flat when astronauts have went out ?
that's so dumb .
cause they've seen videos .
they've seen photos of like circled earth .
but they probably think its like photoshop .
which is probably the worse thing to do while you're in space .
is photoshop something .
alright .
can you tell me what's going on in this picture ?
he is working on a bird house .
and the birds seem to be excited .
and why is his dog the size of him ?
and why is the bird house bigger than him ?
he must be like the size of an atom .
and his dog must be the size of an atom too .
and those birds must be the size of like an atom of an atom .
and that must be like d n a of an atom .
oo .
okay .
and that must be an atom .
atom .
atom .
atom .
atom .
atom .
d n a of atom .
d n a of atom .
i see, i see what you're saying .

well violin, violin .
nice .
do you know how to play any instruments ?
i know how to play piano .
i have one at home .
that's so cool .
how long have you been playing piano ?
and i don't understand how music notes even work .
how about i show you this one ?
what's going on here ?
a king frog in a cup .
in a cup .
that's really all to say here .
why do you think the frog's in the cup ?
i guess it's it's home .
and that frog looks very cute .
little froggy .
what do you think the frog did to be a king ?
he ate another frog .
oo .
i mean that's probably why he's the size of a cup .
and do you know that we saw a toad at nana's that was this big ?
pretty much .
oo .
it was so big .
it's almost as big as his face .
i know .
it was like round .
like literally it was that chunky .
it was round .
did you touch it ?
no .
if you touched it what do you think it would feel like ?
slime .
but i would definitely touch this frog .
do you think ?
but if it ate another frog i wouldn't because probably bite my finger off .
that could be true .
i mean if a frog ate another frog it's probably bound to be eating the earth soon .
or the one dwarf star we have .
pluto .
can you tell me about this picture ?
cutting up cheese .
making a sandwich with a giraffe .
have you ever seen a giraffe ?
at a zoo i have .

safina sophie or sophino .
what was it ?
so the the hippo or whatever .
fiona ?
fiona is so cute .
it's so cute .
and right when we stepped, stepped in the line and like saw her she pooped in the water .
diarrhea .
is that how fiona shows off ?
poops in water .
how big was fiona ?
about the size of you and that computer combined .
really ?
and she actually weighs seventeen hundred .
pounds .
that's so big .
it's so big .
i know .
i know .
i know .
and that's too tall of a sandwich to make .
that's like a double like two sandwiches combined .
so like four sandwiches combined .
like two like two club sandwiches combined .
that would be four toothpicks i think .
no .
two .
two toothpicks .
do you think that's too much ?
probably .
let's count them .
go for it .
one .
two .
three .
four .
oo .
that's four .
that's two club sandwiches combined .
what about this one ?
king llama with a party hat on .
with a bunch of gold and some candy .
and it looks like it's about to get married .
oo .
okay .
it has a ring .
a chocolate bar .
some probably .
chocolate coins maybe .
okay .
and a diamond .
maybe ss getting married to two persons .
oo .
who knows .
a necklace .
maybe that's a present .
and what else can we see here ?
the goat is weird .
what do you think ?

you said a king goat .
what do you think makes it a king ?
it has a giant vault .
and it has a throne .
hello .
hello .
okay .
how about this picture ?
a bear selling potatos for seventy five cents a pound .
would you buy potatos from a bear ?
if it's seventy five cents for a pound i would .
that's not bad is it ?
but if it's like a dollar for like a whole, just one potato i would probably run away because it might have snapped my face off .
but i, i would take the risk for seventy five cents a pound .
that's a good deal .
isn't a pound like three potatos ?
or four ?
a pound is a few potatos so i think it's more than that .
so like five potatos for seventy five cents ?
that's a good deal .
you know a lot about your deals .
i like it .
i like it .
like .
is that the end ?
let me show you this one .
what's going on here ?
a pig a pig in a bathtub .
a pig a pig it is taking a bath .
and why is a rubber ducky out of the pool ?
that's number one rule .
always have a ducky in your pool .
who do you think put the pig in a bathtub ?
its owner probably like got all in mud .
probably face planted into mud .
do you like pigs ?
and why is there soap out of a bathtub ?
i don't know .
why is it spilling everywhere ?
clean that up .

and the pencil .
and glasses .
and it looks like it's a girl somehow .
okay .
weird .
and .
what about this picture ?
brushing your teeth with a lion isn't the best idea .
why not ?
it will probably be a one hundred percent guarantee if you want to brush a lion's teeth .
if it doesn't want to it will snap your face off .
and you better not tie a thing to the back of it's tail .
it might bite your face off .
did you see a tiger at the zoo too ?
not real .
and if you wear bunny slip slippers .
if you see .
if that lion sees them your feet will be its feast .
what are you going to do to save yourself my dude ?
that's probably one hundred percent go one hundred miles back .

djembe .
djembe is a drum from west africa .
the word jj djembe .
djembe .
djembe means everyone come together in peace .
this drum pl .
is played to tell a story .
people often come together to play their drum in a group .
three or four may be played together in a drum circle .
people come together to hear the drum music .
and they like to dance to the beat .
they also tell a story with their dancing .
a djembe hahas a shell made of hh hh .
made of hard wood .
is made from the skin of a goat .
it can be different sizes .
this kind of drum can be two to fifteen inches around .
as high as twenty three to twenty five inches tall .
it can be eleven .
to twenty nine pounds .
this kind of drum can make .
different kinds of sounds .
it can make a low ss .
sound low or a sound high or it can sound how .
the music can also be quiet .
or it can be very loud .
a long time ago, only the men would play a drum .
it was rare to see a woman play a drum in west africa .
so people were surprised when they saw a woman djembe player .
they the woman had to work very hard to get to play .
now, there are women drum circles .
and the women are just as good as playing music as the men .
this kind of drum was first played in west africa .
but now it is played all over the world !
it is even played in our country !
next time you listen to music, you may hear the best beat of the .
djembe .
djembe in the song .

it is a fact that some kids do not eat right .
if kids don't eat healthy foods, they can get sick .
to your best, you must eat right .
i wanted to help kids eat right .
so i started a garden at the ss .
at school .
like the garden at the white house .
i asked my friends at school to help me .
and they said yes !
they were really excited .
then i asked my teacher missus burns to help us .
that is such a good idea theo, missus burns said .
i would be happy to help !
missus miss burns asked our principal if we could use a part of the playground to make to make a raised garden bed .
the principal said yes !
i asked my grandfather to help us too .
my grandfather said yes !
he he was an excellent builder .
and he he made the raised bed for us .
in early spring miss burns helped us plant seeds in cups in our classroom .
we watched the seeds sprout through the soil and grow to seedlings .
in may, it was time to plant the seedlings .
we grew lots of vegetables .
we had to make sure the plants had plenty of water in the summer .
we took turns coming to school to take care of the plants .
by july, the garden was looking great !
there were lots of vegetables .
and they tasted fresh !
when school started again, there were plenty of vegetables .
so all the helpers had fresh vegetables for lunch !
in the fall, we had a harvest party to celebrate the garden .
it felt good to work hard on the garden and know that we helped children eat healthy .
good job you're really good at using the exclamation points !
thanks .

alright so now we're going to look at some pictures .
okay ?
and .
i want you to tell me everything that you see .
fish .
a lion .
a kid .
an and a boat .
do you see anything else ?
flowers .
and a bug .
okay .
that's all i can can make out .
so why are they in a boat together ?
i have no clue .
could you come up with a story for me ?
be as creative as you want to be .
okay ?
one ?
this .
this lion could have powers .
it could talk .
i'm thinking of a story that my mother has read me that's fantasy .
oo .
once upon a time there was a little boy named .
i got to think of a name !
what's the best name ?
alex ?
i'm trying to think .
edmund !
once there was a boy named edmund who loved lions .
but didn't know that there was one lion that was at the zoo that had magical powers .
and then one time that drah that lion escaped .
and went into a boat that had the little boy in it .
and they lived happily together .
edmund that sounds like the chronicles of narnia .
have you ever heard of that story ?
yes .
because my mother's reading that to me .
wait .
it's so good !
and the name of the lion is aslan .
now what ?
what about the fish ?
why is it upside down ?
wait what ?
do they have ?
can the fish ?
does the fish have powers ?
yes .
and .
does it come from outer space ?
and then there was fish from outer space .
how'd they get here ?
he was evil .
he had traveled from space all the way to earth .
my gosh .
to steal the lion away .
and take him to space .
so they could use his magical powers .
the end .
my gosh .
what are they trying to use his magical powers for ?
they want to destroy earth .
no !
and how's this boy going to help the lion ?
what can he offer ?
he's going tt .
the boy was going to row him away to get safe from all the fish .
because all the fish were evil .
sounds .
the end .
scary .
alright let's look at this next one .
okay ?
this is going to be fun .
i want to tell the story first .
yes please .
once upon a time there was a boy who wanted wanted so much to be an astronaut .
well okay .
maybe not astronaut .
that would be cool .
and so he practiced pretending flying planes by using his bed to act like he was a plane .
and he made paper airplanes .
so it could look like a jets .
and .
this is hard .
the kk .
this was enchanted place .
and the clouds could talk .
and the wind could too .
you could see the wind .
it was a very majestical place .
if clouds could talk what would they say ?
the cloud .
one cloud said to another cloud, pete what's going on ?
what else ?
and pete .
and pete said what's going on chicken ?
i have no clue what's going on said pete .
i'm a chicken .
that's an amazing conversation .
do you see anything else in this picture ?
there's a lot going on .
and his fish could talk .
which is amazing .
he always said blub blub hello .
blub blub goodbye .
blub blub chickens .
is this an evil fish from this ?
or is it a nice fish ?
it was the only fish .
remember the story that i told earlier ?
that was the ff .
it was the only nice fish left on the planet .
and so it was doing its best to keep the boy safe .
because guess what ?
i'm pretending that this boy is the same boy from this one .
oo .
so .
the lion was hidden .
he always liked .
he had prepared a room in the up in the attic .
because his mother hated lions .
she was working for the fish .
no way .
so was his father .
are you kidding ?
and .
me ?
and his father's father and mother .
and his mother's father and mother .
but those .
his whole family is against him ?
except his great grandfather .
his great grandmother .
thank goodness .
right ?
everyone else in his family except .
they the fish actually controlled the people .
it had only gotten them under control .
but the others stayed safe .
and since his .
they had gone away .
the other people in his family kk would help him .
and his pet fish was a very good companion .
so how come the fish can control everyone when they have to be in water at all times ?
could all the people hide on dry land ?
because they can turn .
have you seen luca ?
no .
well it's like him .
he is a fish .
and when he's on land he turns into a human .
they go on land .
and turn into a human .
that's scary sometimes .
but this one since he's with all of the of the family members have had to live with him .
and that fish had power over that entire family .
because he had he was spirit of the most .
he was the the spirit of all the goddess fish who was trying to destroy them .
my gosh .
so do you think his family that all are working against him do you think they're actually fish ?
that have turned into a family member ?
and pretending that they're their family members ?
and then all of his real family are somewhere else ?
that's actually true .
how'd you read my mind ?
really ?
my gosh .
because your story telling skills are so amazing .
thank you .
so how come there's no ceiling here ?
wait .
hang on .
i think i've come up with pp .
they had taken off the ceiling .
because he wanted to fly his planes out into the night sky .
he loved the stars .
he loved the sky .
so he had his parents .
his real parents before they had been stolen they hhhe had his parent parents .
take the roof off the entire house .
because the they had loved the night sky .
what happened when it rained or it was cold ?
it never rained or ever cold .
it was only spring .
with no rain .
because they had plenty of water in the streams .
because the sun did not shine too brightly like it does here on earth .
so where is this magical place that doesn't have rain ?
it's always beautiful weather .
where's this place ?
it's hidden far back in the deeps of the space .
so were they ?
it's .
from earth ?
or are they from a different planet ?
different planet .
what's the planet called ?
hang on .
let me think of a name .
jibo .
you're going to name the planet jibo ?
that's .
that's cool .
are there a bunch of robots that roam the planet too ?
they are all friendly .
okay .
so they're all good robots ?
yes .
good robots .
and they're all named jibo .
alright you did awesome with explaining this one .
you got .
okay .
a couple more pictures we're going to look at .
okay .
okay this is funny !
can you tell me about this picture ?
can i say something real quick ?
all these stories are you are from a different planet .
i'll tell you the names of this plan .
okay .
the name of this planet first .
alright .
it's called .
can you guess it ?
i don't know .
i'm not that good at reading minds .
it starts with a j !
what's the name of the robot ?
jibo planet number two ?
my gosh .
is it just called jibo two ?
jibo two .
okay .
okay .
once upon a time .
wait .
is this supposed to be a girl ?
okay .
wah !
that's not .
that's okay .
it's okay .
what is jibo ?
is jibo part of the games ?
at the end we're going to get to talk to jibo a little bit more .
okay ?
for right now .
i can't wait to talk to him .
let's look at this .
let's look at this picture for now .
once there was a girl who lived on a planet called jibo two .
it was a very magical planet .
it lived .
it was right above jibo planet one .
that's the name of the planet .
and there was robots there as well .
and they were all named jibo .
because all the robots on enchanted places were named jibo .
jibo heard his name .
hi jibo .
and what about these people ?
why are they on jibo planet two ?
because the evil fish have forced them away from their home .
but .
what's this called ?
jibo .
it's called jibo .
do you know what animal this is ?
it's a octopus .
but .
so they're .
it's actually going to be called jibo planet cat .
okay .
okay .
that's interesting .
because i think jibo planet cat is a good name for it .
i think so too .
the cats .
so this is a .
it can .
it's actually a cats that can turn into octopus .
that way it can swim in space .
so this is another animal that lives in water .
is it good or bad ?
good .
all the animals that live on enchanted places are good .
but the people .
the animals on earth are evil in the stories .
okay .
this is going to be a series called jibo !
i'm excited .
why does jibo turn blue ?
because he hears his name .
when does he hear his name jibo ?
jibo !
jibo !
look .
say it really loud .
jibo !
there you go .
and okay .
let's keep looking at this picture .
what's she doing ?
she was a scientist .
who liked experimenting with light .
hoping that she could bring light to planet jibo number two .
the planet jibo was a very good place .
and they her relatives lived on jibo .
so she's a good scientist ?
not a mad scientist ?
she's not a mad scientist .
she's a good scientist .
she has very good a scienscientist work .
and her name was jibo .
what kind of research does she do ?
actually haven't thought about that .
she researches about their home the planet jibo .
actually .
no .
she searches about planet jibo .
not planet jibo two !
and turn blue .
alright let's look at this one .
okay ?
okay .
wait .
wait why is that huge ?
i don't know .
you tell me .
can i name it jibo ?
sure .
everything should be named jibo .
tell me about this picture .
so the jibo boy .
okay never mind .
carried a jibo radish .
he .
it was a huge jibo radish .
because jibo radishes were his favorite thing to eat .
he made jibo radiradish soups .
everything that he ate was made out of jibo radishes !
so he .
and he had a pet slug named .
can you guess it ?
jonathan ?
what ?
is that what ?
is that what you were going to name it ?
no !
i was going to name it jibo !
jibo !
it had .
everything needs to be named jibo .
okay .
jibo .
so on this planet is everything big ?
yes .
or are all the people really small ?
the people are really small .
and these are really small too .
that way .
and by the way the name of this planet was jibo number three .
no .
okay .
jibo three .
jibo three .
jibo three !
i mean .
so this is just the jibo galaxy over here ?
yes .
it was a different galaxy that's had been that had not that evil fish had not .
been to yet ?
yes .
because they couldn't go out of that galaxy .
it was too hard for them .

in nineteen fifty five, the city she lived in .

lived in had an unfair law .
the law stated .
that if there were not enough seats on the bus for white people, black people must let the white people sit in their seats .
soon after rosa got on the bus, but the seats were full full .
then, more white people got on the bus .
the white people waited for rosa to get up from her seat .
rosa didn't think it was fair .
she did not want to be treated poorly poorly any longer just because she was black .
she said no .
and did not give up her seat .
rosa parks was arrested .
and put in jail .
many people found out what had happened .
some didn't think it was fair .
and felt mad .

maybe .
anything else ?
i don't .
there's lily pads .
i think that's it .
okay .
we can move on to the next one .
okay .
so it's a kid playing with his toy airplane .
and making paper airplanes .
and pretending he's flying in the sky .
but on his bed .
anything you see around the room that you want to point out ?
there's cars on the floor .
there's a fish .
maybe it's the boy from, like, the fishing .
and he caught a pet fish .
that's smart .
possibly .
do you think he wants to be, like, a pilot or something ?
maybe !
why do you think there's no ceiling in his room ?
no ceiling .
i don't know .
maybe because he doesn't have a ceiling .
or maybe the clouds are his ceiling .
because i can see clouds everywhere .
makes sense .
anything else you want to tell me ?
maybe a story behind it, or .
a story .
ww .
they .
once upon a time there were a pilot flying airplanes .
and there were a lot of them flying .
and then they came down to, , pick up the passengers .
that's all .
that's all ?
alright .
we can move onto the next one .
you're doing great .
thanks, jibo .
maybe that's a scientist thinking of something .
and maybe she found an idea so that's why she has a lightbulb .
cause i think .
because lightbulbs mean, like, you have an idea .
there's an octopus .
i don't know how it got there .
what do you think he's experimenting ?
maybe how to make the octopus disappear .
maybe .
what do you think the octopus is doing, though ?
grabbing her stuff .
maybe the octopus is annoying her .
and she wants him to disappear .
maybe .
because it's grabbing all her stuff .
like a book .
a magnifying glass .
a pencil .
i know .
anything else you see ?
a mouse .
two mouses .
and lots of like, experiment stuff .
there's another one .
and a ball .
so once upon a time, a scientist was working in her lab .
then she poured .
well, accidentally made a spell that could make a octopus appear .
she didn't have any ideas to make it disappear .
but then she got one .
so she had a lightbulb .
and then, .
so, she made a potion to make the octopus disappear .
and it worked .
the end .
sounds good .
okay .
let's move on to the next one .
oo .
so .
last one .
a girl is pulling, like, a big something .
onion something .
and and there's lots of little ones .
like one right here .
right here .
and there's one .
excuse me .
there's right there .
and she has a shovel .
maybe she used that to get it out .
there's two snails .
three .
so there's three snail .
so once upon a time, there was a girl who was getting , pullinging .
a vegetable out of her garden .
and it was ginormous .
bigger than the other vegetables that looked like that .
and .
but, there was snails eating her other vegetables .
so she tried to shoo them away .
and it worked .
the end .
that's an amazing story .
how do you think the vegetable got so big, though ?
maybe because .
she might've gr .
planted it, like, for a year .
and then she keeped on watering it .
so that's probably how it got big .
have you ever planted a vegetable before ?
maybe .
maybe ?
but we planted flowers .
were they pretty ?
do you know what kind of flowers ?
no .
no ?
okay .
there's , , , more vegetables on the ground .
there's so many of them .
i know !
anything else about the picture ?
there is a shovel .
so she probably got it out from that .
okay .
i think that's all .
alright .
we can move on .
so go ahead and hit another buzzer for me to go to the next game .
okay .
might've hit all of them .
but we can probably try another .

djembe .
djembe .
djembe is a drum from west africa .
the word djembe means everyone comes together in peace .
the drum is played to tell a story .
people often come together to play their drum in a group .
three or four may be played together to make a drum circle .
people come together to hear the drum .
and they like to dance with the beat .
the people also tell a story with their dancing .
the .
what was ?
djembe ?
a djembe .
has a shell made of hard wood .
the top is made from the skin of a goat .
it can be different sizes .
this kind of drum can be twelve to fifteen inches around .
as high as twenty three to twenty five inches tall .
it can be eleven to nine .
wait .
twenty nine pounds .
this kind of drum can make different kinds of sounds .
it can be very low .
or it can be very high .
the music can also be quiet or can be very loud .
a long time ago only the men would play a drum .
it was rare to see a woman play a drum in west africa ss .
so people were surprised when they saw a woman djembe player .
the woman had to work very hard to get to play .
now there are women drum circlers .
and the women are just as good as playing music as the men .
the kind of drum first played in west africa .
but now it is played all over the world .
it is even seen in our country .
the next time you listen to music you may hear the beat of a djembe in the song .
have you ever played a drum ?

let's do this one .
this story takes places in nineteen fifty five .
one day rosa parks had a long day at work .

rosa got on the bus and sat .
i was here .

the seat she sat in was in the front of the bus .
in nineteen fifty five the city she lived in had an unfair law .
the law sssaid ?
stated .
stated that .
if people were not .
if .
if people were not enough seats on the bus the white people black people must let the white people sit in their seats .
soon after rosa got on the bus the seats were full .
then more white people got on the bus .
the white people waited for rosa to get up from her seat .
rosa didn't think it was fair .
she did not want to be treated poorly any longer just because she was black .
said no .
and did not give up her seat .
rosa parks was arrested and put in jail .
many people found out what had happened .
some did not think it was fair and felt mad .
so the black people in her town decided we are not going to ride the bus until the law is changed .
for one year the black people did not ride the bus .
finally the law was fixed .
rosa parks had helped black people to be treated fairly .
she was a rule model ?
and leader .
all across the united states people began to ins .
instance ?
insist .
insist on being treated fairly .

whenever .
haha !
i can just .
i have some pictures here .
and they're really fun pictures .
and i want you to tell me what you see .
and what do you think is going on and all about them .
it looks like a boy is in a boat with a lion .
hhh on and the boat is on a lake with fish in it with lily pads .
and i don't know what else .
i can say .
that was a good description .
where do you think they're going ?
ththey might be going .
i read a book called the lion in the library .
so maybe the boy is taking the li the lion to a library .
but that's highly unlikely .
well if they went to a library, what would they do ?
they .
in that one book the lion was actually kinda helpful .
really ?
what ?
because he because i think it the because in the book, the librarian fell .
and then the lion roared to get someone's attention .
he he he .
what else happened ?
the lion would go to story hour .
hehe .
and the lion knows how to read ?
i think ss .
maybe !
i don't think the book ever says .
what else do you see going on here ?
it looks like the boy is trying to touch the water .
why do you think he's trying to do that ?
maybe he would just wants to feel it .
how do you think it feels ?
it might feel cold .
or it might feel warm .
and ff .
how do you like your water ?
what ?
how do you like your water ?
cold or warm ?
i kind of like it cold .
because i don't really like it to be warm .
or else it tastes weird .
i don't understand how my mom or my brother like room temperature water .
hehe !
room temperature water .
let's move on .
ha ha ha !
what do you see here ?
it looks like a boy is using his imagination .
it looks like he's pretending to be a pilot .
what else is going on in this room here ?
he's throwing paper airplanes .
and i think he's pretending like they're real .
that's a good observation .
can you tell me about his room ?
it's really messy .
and he has a fish .
he he he .
his .
i think .
i think how all that air is coming in is because his window is open !
that's a good catch .
what else do you see in his room ?
he made a big stack of pillows so he could use them for for him to play on .
good point .
why do you think he's doing what he's doing ?
he's definitely playing .
definitely .
but he's playing and pretending to be a pilot .
specifically .
do you think he wants to be a pi pilot when he grows up ?
i think he's my brother .
he wants to be a pilot too ?
awesome !
and th .
what do you want to be ?
i'm not sure .
you have so much time to figure it out .
i might be a zookeeper because i love sloths but i'm not sure yet .
oo !
you like frogs, you say ?
no sloths .
sloths okay .
i like sloths too .
i can relate to them .
i like to sleep .
what do you see here ?
i see a girl in a lab and an octopus ?
isn't that strange ha ha ha .
and then there are two rats .
maybe they're lab rats he he he .
that's a good point .
and then looks like there's some d n a right there .
and the octopus .
what is the octopus doing ?
i'm not sure .
if you had to guess, what do you think they're doing in a lab together ?
i don't know .
it looks like the octopus is writing stuff down .
he does have something in his hand to write on .
he has a book and a pencil .
what's .
i don't understand this part right here .
it looks like the rat is sitting on like the little thing that you puh that you use your foot to push down to open a trash can .
so why is the trash can not open ?
maybe they're trying to figure out how to open it .
ha ha ha !
do you like science at all ?
what are some things you like about science .
i don't really know .
all i know is that i know some scientists .
okay !
i know marie curie, einstein, and thomas edison .
awesome .
then you met three today, ?
what's going on here ?
it looks like something out of a story .
hhh but ss .
i th .
my prediction is in that in this picture, they let this one grow and grow and grow and grow .
and now it's so big that it's bigger than their head !
and they can't eat it in one bite !
it's definitely bigger than her head .
ha .
with the leaves it's like bigger than her .
what do you think she's going to do with it ?
she might give it to her mom .
and then .
and then her mom might cook with it because it's so big .
i bet you you'd have like a year's worth .
what would she make with that ?
what do you think she's going to make ?
i don't know .
the .
i don't know either .
there are lots of possibilities .
like what ?
cooking hehe !
cooking !
fair enough .
hehe .
what else do you see here ?
it looks like she likes gardening .
wait i think she's on a farm because i feel like .
i i don't know why .
i just feel like that .
because i just now saw the fencing .
that's a good point .
and i .
and i just now saw the one's back there .
so and like the it's a big field .
so hh .
so it's probably a farm .
right .
i see that too .
hehe .
that was a cool picture, wasn't it ?
alright .
well we're done .
do you remember what to do when we're done .
wait that one blue .
so i'm going to press the blue button .
i like that .
good job .
are you a good reader ?
no .
no ?
you want to try ?
let's try .
okay .
okay ?
let's start here .
let's read this here .
billy walked up the front steps .
he rang the doorbell .
he waited .
is anyone home he said .
he hoped the door would open soon .
he didn't like to stand alone on the front step .
it was cold outside .
billy could .
wait .
billy could feel his toes getting cold .
in his boots .
you're actually a good reader .
you tried to trick me .
let's keep going .
no i can't read that well .
let's keep going .
okay .
just a little bit more, okay ?
maybe i came on the wrong day thought billy .
i hhh .
i thought he said he would teach me .
how to play chase tuesday after .
wait .
after school .
we had art .
so i know today is tuesday .
but billy was about to ring the bell again .
he stopped when he heard footsteps inside the house .
the old man was walking toward the door .
sometimes it took him awhile to answer the door .
you're so good at this .
let's just finish the page .
and we'll move on, okay ?
okay .
who's there said a gruff voice .
is that mr billy .
black ?
wait .
black ?
good job !
black at my door ?
you sure .
you sure took your time getting here today .
what took you so long ?
did you stop and talk to all your girlfriends ?
that's silly hehe .
teased mr black .
he opened the door for billy .
grandpa, i know you don't have any girl .
wait .
grandpa, i know you don't have any girlfriends .
i'm .
wait .
i know .
i don't have any girlfriends .
i am only seven years old laughs billy .
i didn't have to walk .
wait .
i didn't have to walk slowly through .
i didn't have to .
wait .
i didn't have to walk slowly through .
the sidewalks were covered with ice .
i didn't want to slip and fall .
billy stepped inside .
inside the house .
don't let your boots drip all over the hallway, billy .
please take them off .
son .
come into the kitchen .
we can eat some warm cookies while i teach you how to play chase .
what did you think about that story ?
i think it was a good story .
and i when i was reading i realized that billy was my age .
and i actually have a friend .
and her name is bella .
and i don't get to see her a lot ever since i moved away .
i'm sure she misses you too, ?
alright .
you did great with that !
we're going to move on .
so you can press the button for me .
if that's red, the closest one to red is orange .
so i'm going to press the orange .
awesome .
good choice .
so we have some more pictures here .
can you tell me what this kid is doing ?
he's brushing his teeth .
how do you brush your teeth .
i'll normally like .
i'll brush, i'll like brush normally .
then i'll go to the back and get the back teeth .
and then i'll do the front of my teeth .
top and bottom .
then i'll do the back .
then top and bottom .
and then i'll .
i heard that it's good to brush your tongue and up here .
very thorough .
what do you use ?
i i .
i i just get my toothbrush wet .
i put the toothpaste on .
then i brush my teeth .
then i get my toothbrush .
you do ?
hehe no i get my toothbrush first .
ha ha ha !
he he he !
great job !
let's see what's next .
what about here ?
he's washing his hands .
how do you wash your hands ?
step by step .
i turn on the water .
then i put the soap on .
then i scrub my hands .
and then i put them under the water .
and then i keep scrubbing .
good job .
that's how my mom taught me to do it .
she taught you well it sounds like, ?
they are tying their shoes .
and i tie my shoes .
i take both strings .
i put them across from each other .
i put one of them .
i put one of the .
what are they called again ?
strings ?
strings through the hole .
and then you pull them .
then you make a bunny ear .
then .
wait .
you make a bunny ear .
you take the other .
and you wrap it around .
and then you put .
then you push it through the hole .
then you use your hand to grab it .
and then you pull .
that sounds .
and then to double knot, you do the same thing .
except you only do the first part .
you .
with the loops .
you take the two bunny ears .
you put them across from each other .
put one of the bunny ears through the hole .
and then pull .
awesome .
do you double knot all of your shoes ?
it's the most secure, right ?
i bet your shoes never fall off .
sometimes they do .
sometimes ?
because i'm not wearing .
no shoe strings .
nope !
i miscalculated that .
what's going on here ?
she's pouring cereal .
and i .
personally, i put the milk first because .
milk first ?
that's new .
not the cereal first ?
no because then it splat .
because then when you pour the milk it splashes all over !
fair enough .
so then what ?
you get your bowl, your milk .
then the cereal .
then what ?
and then i get my spoon .
and then sometimes i'll have milk to drink .
other times i have water .
and sometimes gatorade .
did you nnknow that gatorade is actually all the fluids that come out of your body when you sweat .
it's just all flavored !
so it's not made from alligators ?
no .
no ?
gatorade isn't made from gators ?
no .
no ?
i didn't know that .
what's next here ?
what do you see ?
he's putting on his clothes .
wait or is he taking them off ?
let's go .
wait hhh no !
it .
i think those are .
i think he's putting on his pajamas ?
okay .
maybe ?
because that is a tee shirt .
well tell me how would you put on your pajamas .
well first i have .
well first i have to take a shower .
then i .
and then i put on my pajamas .
sometimes i'll do the bottom first .
then i'll do the top .
but i don't really have a certain way to do it .
okay .
so what if you're getting dressed in the morning .
would you do the same thing ?
what would you do differently ?
i don't take shower in the morning .
because you take them at night .
and sometimes i put on my deodorant .
i don't do it a lot because i honestly i always forget .
ha ha ha .
that's okay .
everyone forgets sometimes, right ?
she is decorating cupcakes !
i want to hear about how you do that .
i don't really decorate cupcakes .
i haven't decorated cupcakes in a long time .
but what i do decor .
but the most recent thing i decorated with icing and sprinkles .
was actually pancakes .
pancakes ?
tell me how you make some pancakes .
do you know how to make pancakes ?
so this is how i do it .
i me and my grandpa do it this way .
it's very weird .
so you get out all the supplies like .
a whisk .
stuff like that .
and the batter or batter, the mix !
and then you put the mix in .
then you put it in water .
then you mix it up .
and if it's a bit too wet, you will put in more batter .
but if it's a bit too dry .
wait no wait .
if you if it's a bit too dry you put in more water so it's more moist .
but then if it's just perfect .
you'll mix it .
and put in the vun .
put in some vanilla .
and that's how me and my grandpa do it .
then you put in some sugar .
and sometimes you can put in milk .
but if you don't want to you don't have to .
and then you p .
and then you use a measuring cup .
which you don't have to put in any certain amount .
you just use it to scoop out the batter .
and then put it on the griddle .
and then you do that .
and then you wait for it to cook .
and then you flip it .
and then you wait for that side to cook .
then it's done .
and then you put on the icing and the sprinkles .
sounds like i need to come to your grandpa's house for pancakes, ?
grandma and grandpa's house .
grandma and grandpa make the best pancakes .
noted .
what's going on here ?
it looks like she painting .
do you know how to paint ?
it's really fun !
tell me about it !
so the thing that i'm working on painting right now is actually at school .
it's on the drying rack in the art room .
cool !
so i'm going to finish that .
and it's .
i used masking tape and blue paint and red paint .
so basically what i did is i put the masking tape in the shape of a heart .
and then filled it in with more of it .
with more .
and i filled up the heart with more masking tape .
and then i .
so i could paint over it .
and then it'll still be in the shape of a heart .
so then .
cool !
so then i painted everything blue .
and then i didn't have .
and then i did start on the heart .
but i didn't get to finish the blue .
so i still have some blue left .
okay .
what color are you going to paint the heart ?
red .
red !
that's a good color .
ha .
let's do a couple more .
what's going on here ?
he's putting on his seat belt .
how do you do that ?
i just grab the seatbelt, pull it, and sometimes .
sometimes i'll pull it all the way so i know i have enough .
ha ha ha .
but now i don't pull it all the way .
like i'll pull it some .

let's take it piece by piece .

a fish .
this is .
i think in the .

what do you think they're doing in a boat together ?
they're going swimming .
would you go swimming with a lion ?
no .
why not ?
i don't know .
you don't know ?
no .
do you think it's safe to go swimming with a lion ?
nope .
why ?
i don't know .
it's not safe .
because he might try to eat me .
he might .
he might get mad .
he's not trying to eat this boy .
it's a drawing !
good point, good point .
i'm going to take this and just put it to the side, okay ?
there you go .
thank you .
alright .
have you ever been in a boat before ?
nope .
no ?
has be bibo, jibo been in a boat ?
jibo, have you ever been in a boat ?
no .
jibo's not very water proof so that wouldn't .
wait, why does he light up blue ?
that's his favorite color .
i know .
i know his favorite col .
i knew his favorite color .
because the box is blue .
one the one he .
his box is blue .
the one he came out of .
that's his box .
that's his home .
now you say it .
yes .
okay .
so, anything else you want to tell me about this picture ?
lily pads .
okay .
that looks like pizza .
anything else ?
no .
alright .
look at the picture .
he has cah .
what is this ?
a boy throwing a paper airplane on his bed .
and his .
and his room is messy .
and he needs to clean it .
with a fish in a bowl .
with the fish in the bowl .
and .
does your room look like this ?
no .
no ?
nope .
do you keep it nice and clean ?
no .
you don't kle keep it clean ?
no .
so your room does look like this, ?
it doesn't .
his room .
okay .
fine .
my room is messy .
sometimes it does ?
yes .
what do you think he wants to be when he grows up ?
a pi lot .
a pilot .
what do you want to be when you grow up ?
i don't know .
nothing .
i'll get .
nothing ?
i'll .
i don't know .
i'm going to get my .
i'm going to make a decision when i'm like sixteen .
you want to get what ?
i'm going to make a decision when i'm like sixteen .
you want to get surgery ?
no !
what ?
i said i'm gonna, , get a job when i'm sixteen .
and i don't know what .
you're going to .
yet .
get a job when you're sixteen ?
yes .
because i'll ha, i'll be able to drive .
jibo .
jibo .
do you know ?
what's your name ?
hi, i'm jibo .
and i'm a social robot .
yep .
that's jibo .
anything else you want to tell me about this picture ?
no .
okay .
i'm just going to fix the microphone one last time .
because i'm not sure .
your jacket .
okay .
alright, move on to the next one .
jibo .
do you want to learn with me ?
i don't know how to answer that .
now you say it .
i think jibo wants you to tell him about this picture .
what else can you call it ?
i'm not sure .
jibo .
i'm not sure what he's just said .
what is this ?
what is this ?
it's a drawer .
it is .
and then there's a girl that wants to be a scientist .
no .
shshe is a scientist .
why do you think that ?
because look at her whole room !
and there's literally a rat right next to her there .
do you think that rat is a friend or do you think it's an experiment ?
i think it's an experiment .
what do you think they're doing ?
i think they're trying to make him into a tiger .
because that tiger was probably friendly .
because it was him .
that makes sense .
so they put the tiger on a boat with that boy .
hhhe because he probably likes tigers .
maybe he doesn't want a real one with him .
so they put a fake one .
okay .
that makes so much sense .
and he didn't know how to use his teeth and stuff .
so he couldn't hurt .
that's probably it !
good story .
what's this guy ?
i don't know .
you don't know ?
seems like a ops ococtopus .
is he one of those ?
is he's one of those ?
octopuses ?
it looks like he is .
jibo .
why'd you give me such a hard activity ?
i thought it was going to be fun !
i'm having fun .
jibo can do something fun when you finish this okay ?
you guys can .
do a cool trick after .
alright, anything else about this picture ?
no .
okay .
last picture we have for this activity .
is that a huge onion that she just digged out the ground ?
and that's a girl .
and she probably wants to .
and she's a cook probably .
she probably is .
what do you think she's going to cook with that ?
onion soup .
oo, do you like onion soup ?
oo !
no .
she can make onion powder out of it .
it is not .
it's a good spice !
what else do you see in the picture ?
i don't know .
just that ?
a seashell .
and that's probably the canister that she puts the stuff in .
no .
that's .
that's .
it looks like .
a snail .
a snail ?
two snails .
three !
three snails ?
and then she has two more onions digged up right there .
why do you think this onion is so much bigger than the other ones ?
so it's probably a special one .
why is it special ?
it probably has a whole bunch of onions mixed into one .
maybe that's it !
and then they grew .
because it was getting stretched out .
how long do you think it took that onion to grow that big ?
you can probably just cut it open and put all the onions that been growing .
and then they closed and sealed it up somehow .
then and then they put it in the ground .
they made a story like this .
and then now they're just acting like they .
it's been growing for years .
very good .
anything else about this picture ?
no .
alright !
you're doing great !
thanks, jibo .

what about making a mini one ?
well they will grow no matter what .
you can't invent one that's tiny ?
well it starts out tiny because it'll be an egg .
so then when it .
until it's getting bigger and big i'll let it outside .

this one is division .
can you read this one ?
how am i supposed to know the answer ?
you can just read it .
two, twenty one division three .
and then can you ?
what ?
read this one ?
six times three equals .
this is .
three .
tough, so if you don't .
six .
know it, that's totally fair .
twelve of fifteen ?
that's really .
eighteen .

no .
why not ?
because they're so big .
and that's a little boat .
that's true .
it is a little boat .
if it were a bigger boat would you get in a boat with him ?
alright .
anything else about this picture ?
and fish are swimming .
and they don't want to hit the fish .
so they use their arms .
the boy uses his arms to swim to shore .
looking out for those little fish ?
awesome job .
what is this ?
this boy wanted to be a pilot .
so he started making paper airplanes .
so to train him .
and he wanted to do it .
so he stacked a bunch of pillows on his bed .
and flew the paper airplane .
then jumped on his bed like the plane was dru .
the plane was going up and down .
and he opened the window so there could be a little wind to push it .
and then he climbed up .
then he started jumping on it .
and throwing the paper airplanes .
that's .
and .
ope .
he returned his toy plane on .
and it started flying with the wind too .
that's so good .
i loved that story .
man .
what do you think ?
so you think he he wants to be a pilot when he gets older ?
what do you think about his ceiling ?
is that real life ?
no .
no .
why not ?
because there can't be clouds in a room .
that's true .
he's using his imagination ?
does your room look like this ?
no .
it's clean .
do you clean your room ?
very good .
alright .
anything else about this picture ?
and his fish is worried that one of the paper airplanes is going to go into the fish bowl .

look at the picture .
this girl wants to be a scientist .
so she meh .
she got a octopus .
and did experiments on it .
the octopus is trying to tear down everything while being in a ball .
but she's doing a experiment with a light bulb .
and she's putting it on the electric desk .
and seeing if it would turn on or not .
and the fish was .
and the octopus was worried because .
it was like what if it shocks me ?
but she knew it wouldn't shock it because her desk just absorbs it and charges other stuff .
the mouse was high .
was trying to hide under the shelf .
under .
behind the books because it didn't want to get shocked either .
those two .
so they hid behind stuff .
and under stuff because it .
because they're plastic .
some of those book covers are plastic .
and that trash can is plastic .
so it will not shock them .
that's so good .
you're so smart .

you guys are best buds ?
not quite .
i i still haven't met him though .
but i've seen fan made videos .
okay .
of sonic fighting a fanmade character .
what's in the videos ?
it's basically sonic fighting naso, which is a fanmade character .
it's like a light blue version of sonic made from negative energy from the chaos islands .
i don't know why .
but, but it's how sonic physics work .
do you play video games with sonic in it ?
sometimes .
only on the play station five though .
okay .
i .
so do you just like to watch videos of him ?

what do they like to build in minecraft ?
hmm, you don't really build anything .
it's just about all .
what all the regular sonic games would be about .
collecting the chaos emeralds, becoming super sonic .
and that's basically the end of sonic minecraft .
i'm planning to get those emeralds in, in sonic minecraft if .

it gives the option to put sound effects, movement, and all that other stuff .
you can create your own characters .
and it's all super simple and wha .

i call it a mini game engine .
it's like a game engine but easier to use .
and stuff like that .
okay .
what would your cardboard level look like ?
probably like any old sonic level .

oo .
i'm going to show you some pictures and you're going to tell me about them .
oo .
okay .
look at the picture .
there it is .
so what do you see there ?
so there is a lion with a kid on a boat .
and there's fish with a pond .
and some flowers .
so what do you think they're doing there ?
they're going fishing i think ?
for what ?
some fish .
okay .
for the lion to eat .
so a boy .
because .
go for it !
because lions get hungry very easily .
do they ?
because when they smell meat ththey wake up so fast .
they they can just .
they can go straight on to predators .
they eat .
do you know a lot about lions ?
very cool .
anything else you know about them ?
not really but .
it looks like this lion adopted him .
okay .
so you think the lion is taking care of the boy ?
yep .
how do you think they met ?
well the lion the lion was probably travelling to get some food .
and then the the baby boy was with his family .
and then his family got lost .
and he was still going because he thought his family was probably still with him .
and then he met the lion .
and then they probably .
that's a good idea .
maybe .
so you think this is a friendly lion ?
or what do you think this lion is like ?
he's pro soon as the lion met the boy he was probably a little bit aggressive .
but and then probably they got along .
and then became friends .
sounds great !
would you be friends with a lion ?
but it's pretty much a risk to do that .
because you might lose a hand or fingers .
its possible .
where do you see lions normally ?
the zoos .
the zoos .
do you go to the zoo a lot ?
not really but i only been to a zoo twice or once .
okay, was it fun ?
okay .
op i think that's it .
alright anything else you want to say about this one ?
it's a nice picture .
it is a nice picture, right ?
i love these .
look closely, look at the fish .
what do you notice ?
that ff .
that fish is swimming upside down .

yep .
what stuff is on the floor ?
a little racecar .
a sock .
a piece of paper .
and a little truck toy .

but i can rebuild it .
very cool !
yep .
awesome .
so .
do you think this kid wants to be a pilot ?
or what do you think this kid wants to do ?
this kid wants to be a plane pilot .
have you been on a plane before ?
like to take us somewhere yes .
a big huge like .
plane .
would you want to be a pilot ?
nah .
nah, what would you want to be ?
a carpenter just like my dad .

i can hold this .
and it's opened .
what else ?
and there's a mouse or a rat .
and he's running with a lightbulb in his hand .
and there's a science picture right there .
and there's some shelves .
and that .
so what do you think they're doing ?
i think the octopus is trying to learn .
learn what ?
probably science or something and the book .
okay .
what do you think the person is doing ?
he is probably doing science .
he's .
do you think they're helping each other or .
probably the octopus is reading to him so he knows what to do .
so very helpful .

no not really .
are you not a science person ?
no .
what do you like at school ?
gym .
gym, .
do you play sports ?

that's a good point !
so i can eat .
what sports do you like ?
normally i like football but i i quitted .
okay .
but i did football camp but i don't want to have regular football .
probably time consuming i'd assume ?
but i do like football camp .
if you like running you could do like track or something in the future too .
because i already like ran like .
the two days i was at football camp i .
the first day we did stuff .
and then at when my mom and dad and sister came in i ran a whole track .
woah, that's awesome !

very good idea .
that's the first time i've heard someone suggest that .
that's smart .
ts yup .

a sunny spot .
plants need sunshine to grow nice vegetables and flowers .
a spot that faces south the best .
good soil .
soil is a kind of dirt .
pile up soil like a small hill so that water can go down the pile of soil .
should be about twelve inches or the size of a ruler .
it was good it is good for your plants .
worms like to live in the soil .
to invite worms put cut up leaves three inches down in your soil .
water .
it is hot and dry outside .
you will need to give more water to your garden .
best test is to put your finger in the soil .
if you get mud on your hands it is too wet .
if the soil is dusty the plants need water .
some plants grow in few weeks .
others take a few months .
you must wait .
and take care of your plants .
then enjoy the food and flowers from your garden .

but one of them is a little weird .
and i see some lily pads in the pond .
and i see a dragonfly .
and i think i see mountains in the background .
so how they got here is a boy was exploring in the forest .
and he met a lion .
and they became friends .
and then they traveled off to a pond far away .
and then they found a boat .
and they hopped in the boat .
and they .
and they went into the pond to sail and see the fish .
how do you think they make became friends ?
would you become friends with a lion ?
i could .
you could, .
i .
it might be hard .
but .
so, maybe he gave it some meat to eat .
so he wouldn't eat him ?
anything else ?
no .
alright we can move on .
okay .
okay so i see a boy in his room .
and he's dressed up like a pilot .
and i think he's pretending that his bed is a airplane .
and he's pretend .
this is his imagination .
and he's flying through the sky .
and .
and he has a paper airplane .
and it's flying around .
that's what i see .
so this boy, he didn't know what to do .
so he decided to pretend he was flying a plane through his bedroom .
and you would pretend his bed is the plane .
so and he wanted to get high up .
so he got some, a lot of pillows .
and he got on top of them .
and he made a paper airplane .
and he pretended that it was flying through the air .
that makes sense to me .
anything else you see around his room ?
i see some cars .
maybe he was pretending that's down below .
and i see a little fish over there .
and it looks like a pretty nice day outside .
that's pretty much all i seem to see .
perfect .
alright we can move onto this one .
okay .
oo .
so this looks like a girl who is pretending to be a scientist or is a scientist .
and there is a giant octopus .
and it is reading her books .
and it's sqigsquiggling around her lab .
and she has a book .
i see she has two pet mice .
and , there are a lot of test tubes and beacons .
and i see some graphs on the walls .
and i see safety first .
she has goggles on .
and she has a clipboard .
so maybe she is a scientist .
and she has .
she's experimenting on a giant octopus .
and she .
she has an idea because she has a lightbulb .
and maybe it is to , do an experiment on this octopus .
but not hurting it in any ways .
just doing it, an experiment on it .
and .
and maybe she'll use some beacons in this experiment, maybe .
and .
and probably her two pet mice are probably just going to run around .
and relax .
and not help with the experiment .
that's pretty much what i see .
what do you think she is experimenting on the octopus for ?
like what is she trying to figure out ?
i don't know .
what what do you want to figure out about an octopus ?
maybe how they produce their ink .
that's .
alright, we'll move onto the next one .
ok .
my goodness .
so i see a girl .
and she's very happy .
probably because she found a ginormous radish .
and i think she is looking to eat it .
and i see it's a pretty nice day .
and there are two snails .
and i see some other normal sized vegetables .
maybe they could be big vegetables .
i don't really know .
and, so maybe she has a garden .
and she went out to her garden one day .
and she found a ginormous radish .
and she pulled .
and pulled .
and pulled .
and she got the radish out .
and now she's thinking of splitting it with her friends the snails .
wha how do you think the radish got so big ?
well i know that plants need sunshine, water, good soil, and oxygen to survive .
so maybe it was a really nice day .
and then it was raining for a for a little while .
and there was really rich and nice soil .
and then it grew woo, boing !
and then it grew super big !
alright, that is all for this one .
go ahead and hit another buzzer .
i feel .
did i hit all of them ?
did you hit the purple one ?
i don't know .
i .
i know i hit these two and this one .
okay i think maybe you didn't hit the purple one yet .
okay .
not sure .
have you hit that one ?
i did .
i think .
i think i did .
well you can hit two at once next time .
okay .
alright, do you like reading ?
yes i do like reading .
perfect .
i just want you to read as much as you can .
okay .
tess tricked her brother ty into going to the park by letting him play with her tennis ball .
the two ran four blocks to the park .
they slowed down to a walk when they could see the tennis courts .
in the summer the courts were always full .
tess was very clever .
she had been earning tennis balls and lessons from people who were playing at the park .
when the courts were full, tess asked people if sh sh people .
tess asked people she knew if they needed help picking up balls .
of course, she never asked strangers .
tess saw some people from church that were taking a break and getting a drink on the side of .
wait, where was i ?
of, of the side of the court .
hi, can i help you pick up balls today she asked .
i can help too said ty .
mrs sims smiled and said, that would be nice, but we are all done playing for the day .
maybe next time .
okay, thanks said tess .
ty ran into the next court .
he started to ask two men, can i help you ?
tess took his hand and whispered, ty, we don't know them .
we can't ask them .
we should only ask people we know .
ty looked around and spotted his teachers from church .
he ran in front of tess and asked, can i help you pick up balls ?
after the ball fell to the ground and a point was won, mrs webb said, that would be fantastic !
can my sister help too ty asked .
tess changed her mind about having ty at the park with her .
he was hard .
he was a hard worker too .
and she didn't mind him coming with her .
good job .
you're a fantastic reader .
thank you .
i have good news class said mrs star .
our school is going to have a play .
the play is called the princess and the frog .
the principal wants students in our room to dance in the play .
she knows we have lots of good dancers in our room .
she'd like us to dance the way we dance off the playground .
she will visit later this week to pick children in our room to dance in the play .

everyone shouted, hooray !
we are going to be in a play !
people will come and watch us dance .
what fun !
i'd like to dance in the play, said jamia .
me too, exclaimed tamera .
the girls were good friends .
jamia was a good dancer .
tamera liked to dance .
too but she did not know all the dances .
i know not .
i do not know all the dances .
i will not be picked, said tamera .
i will teach you every dance, said jamia .
each day on the playground the girls practiced every dance .
they practiced so they would be good dancers in the play .
the girls danced and dreamed about being in the play .
all the children danced and danced all week .
on friday, the principal came to pick the dancers to pick dancers for the play .
you are all good dancer, dancers .
i'd like all of you to be in the play she told them .
the children were happy .
they were excited to all be in the play .
tamera hugged jamia .

you're a good friend .
the girls were so happy they smiled and danced .
all the boys and girls joined in the dance too .
alright this is our last one .
okay .
carmelo, sam, and .
rashawn play baseball .
rashawn is a good hitter .
one day, he hit the baseball over the fence .
no said carmmemelo .
now we cannot play .
our ball is gone .
sam said, no problem .
i will jump over the fence and get the ball .
no you can't !
the ball went over mr smith's fence .
mr smith has a big tan dog .
if you jump over the fence, the dog will bark and bite you said carmcarmelo .
sam said, fine .
i will just go knock on mr smith's door .
that is just what he did .
mr smith laughed .
he says, my dog wouldn't hurt a fly .
here's your ball .
sam was a super hero that day .
i never saw snow before .
in so, somasomalia it does not snow .
this is my first winter in ohio .
that's where we are !
it is cold now .
it is cold enough to snow .
i looked out the window before i went to bed .
and i did not see snowflakes fall .
then when i woke up, there was snow on the ground .
i woke my cousin and we ran outside .
the other kids were lying on the ground in the snow .
they were doing jumping jacks on the ground .
when they stood up, i saw the snow angels .
perfect !
you did absolutely fantastic !
go ahead and hit another buzzer or two .
it's up to you .
i think i've done all of them already .
you can hit two at a time .
okay .
alright, perfect .
alright .
i just want you to tell me what's going on in the picture .
and .
okay .
there's a boy .
tell me how .
brushing his teeth .
you would do it .
there's a boy touching, brushing his teeth .
so, how i would brush my teeth, is i would take the tooth .
i would take, first take the toothbrush .
wet the toothbrush .
then take the toothpaste .
and put a pea sized dollop on the toothbrush .
then i would brush in all surfaces .
perfect .
that's a boy washing his hands .
so how i would do this is i would turn on the tap .
wet my hands .
turn off the tap so i don't waste water .
and then i would soap up my hands real good .
and then i'd turn back on the tap .
and rinse my hands to get all the soap off .
it's a boy tying his shoes .
so, i actually don't really know how to tie my shoes very well .
so .
that's okay .
i don't really .
so i know you do something , you cross them .
and then you make a little loop .
and then you have to put the other thing around the loop .
and then you have to insert it into a hole .
but i never know which hole it is .
because there are so many of them .
so .
i know that's exactly right .
that's how one ties their shoes .
okay .
there's a girl putting cereal into a bowl .
so how i would do this .
and i see she poured some milk too .
so i would .
to get the milk, i would go to my refrigerator .
i would open it up .
get the milk out .
get a glass from my, the cupboard .
and then pour the milk into the cup .
and then i would bring it over to the table .
and then i would get the box of cereal .
get a bowl and a spoon .
and pour the cereal into the bowl .
and then i would eat it .
perfect .
it's a boy getting dressed .
so i would .
i don't always wear socks .
so if i was wearing socks, i would just put them on .
and then i would get some underwear on .
and then i would put my pants on .
and then i would put my shirt on .
it's a girl making cupcakes !
i don't really know how to make cupcakes .
have you ?
she's icing the cupcakes .
have you iced cupcakes before ?
i know how to do it .
how would you do that ?
so i would take the icing bag .
and squirt frosting onto the cupcake .
and then i would smooth it out with a knife .
and then i would take some sprinkles .
what's your favorite flavor of cupcake ?
vanilla .
vanilla's a good one .
it's a girl painting .
i like to paint .
so what you do is you dip your brush in the water .
and then you dip it in the color of paint you want to use .
and then you get some paper .
and you paint it on the paper .
what do you like painting usually ?
i like painting .
i espe .
i really like painting abstract art .
and , little shapes and stuff .
that's what i usually like to paint .
it's a boy buckling his seat belt .
so i would just pull out the seat belt .
doo .
and buckle it in .
that's a very simple one .
it's a girl feeding a teddy bear .
so i would scoop up the food .
and then feed it to the teddy bear .
but i don't think the teddy bear would actually eat it .
but you could pretend the teddy bear would eat it .
do you feed your stuffed animals ?
no i do not feed them .
this is a boy dressed up for halloween .
so i would a few maybe months later before halloween, i would pick a costume to wear .
and then over those few months, we would make that costume .
we usually make our bah costumes .
but we .
we usually buy stuff to make the costume .
so and then for halloween i would dress up and go trick-or-treating as you do on halloween .
what have you dressed up for previous halloweens ?
well last halloween, i think i dressed up as a cat .
and then the cat .
and then the one, the halloween before that, i dressed up as a bat .
and then i know when i was really young, i dressed up as a pea .
and an octopus i know when i was really young .
what about this year ?
do you have any idea what you're going to be ?
no .
not yet ?
no, not yet .
these are some kids going down a slide .
so i would climb up the ladder to get to the slide .
and then i would go !
and i would put my feet down at the bottom so i don't go wah !
it's a boy kicking a soccer ball .
so i would put .
i would lift up my leg .
and maybe get a running start .
and then i would go pow, woo !
and the ball would go wah !
do you play any sports ?
no .
i do not .
it's some boys playing with blocks .
making a block tower .
so i would dump out the blocks .
and then i would put one block, two block, three block, four blocks .
and i would stack them up .
that's what i would do .
okay it's a boy .
it's someone pushing a girl on a swing .
so how i would .
wait which one do i have to ?
pushing the swing ?
any .
either one .
do you get pushed on the swing or do you do it by yourself ?
well sometimes when the swing is really high, i need some help getting some velocity .
but at my swing that we built on my plays, on my pirate playset that i have in my backyard, i can just go back on my feet .
and then let go .
and then i start pumping .
and then i eventually get really high .
it's two girls sharing ss a lollipop .
so how i would share a lollipop is i would get the lollipop .
and then i would give the other person some licks of the lollipop .
and then i would have some licks of the lollipop .
and so on .
last one .
what ?
what is he doing ?
i don't know .
so there's some type of timer .
and he's sitting .
so what do you think he's doing ?
thinking ?
possibly .
how would i think is i would think ?
how do you think ?
using your brain !
maybe he's in timeout ?
i don't know how i would do timeout because i'm usually very good in school .
that's good .
i'm glad .
alright, that's all of them .
so go ahead and hit another buzzer or two at a time .
okay .
so i'm going to hit these two .
alright and then we have .
that was a strange noise .
one more thing .
okay .
i'm just going to pick a random picture .
