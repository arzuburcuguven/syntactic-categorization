i want something to drink .

no here go get a juice .
get up and act like a little lady .
come here .
here .
you ready ?
no .
becky bumper's twin stopped chewing her toast long enough to say i'm good too .
baby bonnie lifted her arm .
she wanted to get out of her high chair and sit on her daddy's lap .
but she didn't .
papa picked up picked her up for a minute and then put her back in her own seat .
bumper eat your toast grandma said .
but i can't bite into it answered bumper .
my tooth is loose .
it is not yelled becky .
you're making it up .
i know you are because we're twins and my tooth is not loose .
it's loose bumper insisted look at it move .
bumper wiggled his front tooth for everyone to see .
yuck said becky .
well what does a little child with a loose tooth eat for breakfast asked momma .
what's soft enough ?
ice cream answered bumper immediately !
you can't have ice cream for breakfast said momma .
how about an egg .
no egg said bumper i'll eat my toast .
bumper took a big bite and guess what ?
bumper's loose tooth came out .
what should i do now bumper asked ?
grandma answered first .
you should take your tooth out of your toast papa added .
go to the sink and rinse out your mouth and you can also wash off the tooth .
but be careful not to wash it down the drain .
after he rinsed bumper put his tongue where his tooth used to be .
then he announced i have a hole in my mouth .
don't worry about it said momma .
the hole will soon fill out with another tooth even bigger and stronger than the one you just lost .
mom .
momma kissed bumper .
grandma kissed bumper kissed bumper .
papa kissed bumper .
they all smiled and told him losing his first tooth was something to feel real good about .
becky was upset .
everyone was making a big fuss over bumper .
bumper would probably get something from the tooth fairy and there would be nothing for her .
becky ran out of the kitchen even before she was excused .
bumper ran after becky .
he wanted to show her his tooth and then he wanted to put it under his pillow before it was time to leave for school .
becky becky he shouted .
don't be mad your tooth will fall out soon .
becky didn't answer she just picked up her school bag and headed for the door .
soon grandma called from downstairs let's go twins the bus is here .
becky and bumper hurried outside momma followed .
she was on her way to work .
good bye momma .
said have a good day .
i will said bumper i won't thought thought becky .
now the house was quiet .
papa went to his bedroom for a nap .
what shall we do today grandma asked bonnie ?
bonnie walked over to the kitchen counter she pointed to the mixing bowls .
bonnie wanted grandma to bake cookies and she wanted to help her .
grandma put everything on the kitchen counter kitchen table flour sugar eggs and butter bowls and beaters .
spoons and spatulas .
bonnie sifted and bonnie stirred bonnie poured and bonnie mixed .
grandma dropped the batter onto the cookie sheet one spoonful at a time .
when the cookies were just right grandma took them out of the oven and put them on a plate to cool .
then she said it's time for your nap bonnie .
now it was grandma's time time for grandma to do whatever pleased her .
faster !
she .
went to the living room to practice the violin .
grandma was a good fiddler she liked to make pretty music .
playing made her feel good inside .
grandma played slow songs then some fast ones .
she tapped her foot to keep the rhythm .
grandma's feet danced as she played .
before grandma knew it bonnie was calling .
grandma took bonnie out of the crib out of her crib .
what about this one ?
let's go downstairs and see if our cookies are ready for becky and bumper grandma said to bonnie as she took her by the hand .
bumper and becky were coming up the back path by the time grandma and bonnie got downstairs .
they came inside dropped their school bags in the hall and headed for the kitchen .
they found the cookies already on the kitchen table .
here said bonnie giving each of them one cookie .
who made these bumper asked .
bonnie grinned from ear to ear .
me she shouted !
they look good said bumper .
becky and bumper sat down for glasses of milk .
becky bit hard into her cookie hoping her tooth would fall out just like bumper's .
but it didn't even though becky bit and chewed as hard as she could .
go get her her pacifier .
do you believe in the tooth fairy .
bumper asked .
yep becky answered .
i believe if you leave your tooth in an envelope under your pillow someone will come take the tooth and leave a present instead .
what kind of present ?
i think tooth fairies leave whatever they want but mostly it's money said becky .
how much do you think a quarter but you'll probably only get a nickel .
you're mean answered bumper i'm going up stairs to check under my pillow .
becky ran up the stairs bec bumper ran up the stairs becky followed close behind .
bumper ran right to his bed and shouted the tooth fairy's been here and she left an envelope under my pillow !
bumper tore open the lumpy envelope and smiled as he read the message .
loose tooth wiggly tooth a bite of toast and the tooth falls out .
want me to hit you ?
real hard ?
no no !
here is a shiny new quarter for me hope this has been a good day love the tooth fairy .
i though you would want to save your tooth for a while so i returned it to you .
becky was sitting on her bed looking miserable but something made her check under her pillow .
there's an envelope under my pillow too she yelled across the room and it's lumpy !
becky ripped open the envelope and inside she found a letter and a shiny new quarter .
what did the tooth fairy tell you bumper asked .
and not one minute sooner .
no .

he's looking for some food .

names is because .
because what sweetheart ?
i heard .
some chick chicks from nature or something .
i'm still hungry .
and when is it going to stop ?
you said it's already started again .
so let it start again i hate that !
is it going to start all over ?
chi where did you get this honey ?
on the ground .
for the flowers i thought it would be nice .
it is i put it in the dishwasher so it's all clean .
but it is a little dirty .
well we have it in the dish washer honey .
usually i find a lot of things .
daddy usually keep a something ?
do you want to go return those bottles ?
today that grandma gave you ?
yes .
put it in your bank ?
yes .
look how long my fingers are .
yes .
that's because i'm getting so tall .
that's right .
my fingers are growing longer and longer and longer .
longer and longer and longer and longer .
help .
mom .
mom .
what honey what honey .
come here and see this .
i know .
say bye .
bye inv .
bye .
certainly .
there you go .
what's up ?
i'm just pretending to do a park .
kind of spreads the light out a little bit .
what have you gotta drink there ?
lemonade .
in the cup ?
it's season again .
that's an old commercial .
what ?
that used to be an old commercial .
i don't know if you've seen it even once .
cut it up so it cools because .
tastes great .
it's steamy right in the middle .
let it cool a little bit .
what momma's doing is a cooling aid = play on word .
okay ?
wait .
see all the steam ?
just wait one minute and let the steam come out of it .
has it been a minute yet ?
probably not .
well if you want to start eating it .
you should start around the edges .
there's steam .
on this side .
i'll take ?
that out of your way .
there's garlic bread too .
you want a piece of garlic bread ?
yes please .
this is steaming too .
everything's steaming .
well what do you supposed emmy'sister doing for supper tonight ?
i don't know .
i think =?
say pizza .
pizza ?
could be .
she'll probably stay out late tonight .
she'll be dragging around tomorrow .
what time is she supposed to come home tomorrow ?
you told her the middle of the day .
how's the lasagna ?
great .
can't wait .
can i have some ?
there you are .
this is very nice .
so what gave you the idea for lasagna ?
watching garfield this morning ?
you watched him scarf it down .
he has some unusual diets .
he had a sit on it diet .
and .
a girl would sit on some food .
he could eat what ever he could sit on .
so .
most people would wouldn't mind sitting on lettuce .
and most people would !
mind sitting on .
cake .
right .
so .
if you could sit on it you could eat it .
i could probably sit on a cake .
it would become a pancake if you sat on it .
could i have =?
cut the garlic bread please .
you could sit on a sponge cake .
but it would be difficult to sit on an upside down cake .
why ?
because i'd be upside down .
its top would be on its bottom .
and my top would be on my bottom .
this is good .
and my head would be squished into the cake .
yep .
we'd have to wash cake out of your hair .
that would be the worst part .
no but the worst part is .
having to go with cake on my school .
having cake at your school ?
having cake in my hair on school .
on a school day .
i see .
that would look kind of strange .
some goes in my hair .
that would be awful .
but just think .
you could always have it there for a snack if you got hungry .
this is good dad .
very good .
it's sweet .
maybe if i have time !
tomorrow i'll make a cake .
now you !
brought up a good idea mom !
what kind of cake would you make ?
chocolate .
what ?
chocolate .
now i believe ?
it .
i knew she would make chocolate cake tomorrow .
why ?
because she bought the mix too ?
no .
you went to the store today ?
did you talk her into buying it when you were at the store ?
no she was pretty good .
she only talked me into one thing .
what's that ?
chocolate middle cookies .
i talked you into that .
well that's acceptable .
and we got ice cream sandwiches .
and you wouldn't never do it .
you didn't remind me .
we have we have enough icecream .
yes i did .
we have to use up what we've got before we buy strawberry .
i reminded you .
just ask me .
no .
you better pay attention !
i guess .
we have vanilla and chocolate .
and something else ?
chocolate chip .
we have chocolate chip .
and we have .
chocolate and vanilla .
we have the chocolate .
it's a good day .
it's perfect .
i never expected it to be seventy degrees today .
i know .
i hope it's going to be nice tomorrow .
it's still april .
this is the kind of the weather you have in june if your lucky .
i remember last summer .
i .
invited michael nicky and nicole over .
and .
dad put the slide in the pool and .
we filled the pool with water and we .
keep going splashing in .
that was so fun .
well we can do that again this summer too .
but we gotta wait till summer to do it .
and that pool is getting pretty small .
it wouldn't fit michael .
actually it isn't the pool that's getting smaller it's you that's getting bigger !
i noticed that today .
i couldn't even fit in the .
cart thing .
i kept wiggling around .
and last time .
all i hadta do was .
just put the seat down .
and put something behind my back .
for support .
there's two things for the grocery cart seat .
the grocery cart .
big pretty soon you'll be big enough to .
drive to the store and buy the groceries for us .
i will ?
well .
about thirteen or fourteen years .
i will ?
sure .
in fourteen years .
that's fun .
in fourteen years you'll be seventeen .
and you'll you'll have your driver's license and .
go grocery shopping .
in fourteen years she'll be nineteen .
right i'm sorry .
gee !
only twelve !
years and you'll be seventeen .
suppose emmy will .
supposed emmy will go grocery shopping for us when she gets her .
license ?
now that's hot !
maybe she'll offer to do it just so she can drive the car .
i don't know .
that would be the only !
reason she'd offer .
that would be real good .
i hope she doesn't crash .
well we hope she doesn't crash either .
more lasagna please .
you did a great job .
wait wait .
wait what ?
just a minute .
you get some of the sauce ?
well you don't have any trouble eating now that your .
tooth finally fell out ?
you got a big hole and you're chomping right into it .
sure can .
are any of the other kids in your classroom losing their teeth ?
yep .
katie lost teeth ?
one tooth .
sarah lost .
these two teeth .
i think it's .
this one .
it's the tooth that i lost .
but she already lost it .
those are the first ones to go i bet .
i don't know .
for everybody .
no !
and .
and !
she lost these .
but this one's wiggly .
no but she didn't lost this one .
your bottom ones are coming in pretty good .
let me see .
yep .
they're coming up pretty good .
more lasagna please .
okay .
i'm starting to get a house !
in my mouth .
a what in your mouth ?
a house !
in my mouth .
in mouth .
a big living room for your tongue ?
i'm getting a house !
for my tongue .
well that was .
worth seconds .
well having lasagna is a good .
thing to have when emmy's not here because she doesn't like it .
we're going to have it .
see .
i knew it .
she has fine lines .
but not by emmy .
nope .
but not by my cake .
clyde .
get out of my seat .
clyde .
come on .
he thinks !
he's like garfield .
he wants lasagne .
he probably wouldn't eat it .
licks up .
spaghetti sauce .
doesn't he ?
there .
is lasagnas .
he's feisty later when it's getting dark .
you have the candles .
and moonlight .
am i going to have to go to bed ?
no .
it's the weekend .
you can stay up .
i like this .
i love weekends .
two times two .
most people do .
i like two times .
two times ?
how come two times ?
because .
i don't have to be in school .
and also because i can stay up late .
and another reason too .
what's that ?
i can have friends over .
well micky came down to play most of the day today with you ?
yep .
any any of the other kids around ?
what ?
are any of the other kids around ?
rachel or nicole ?
rachel is around .
but .
i don't want to play with her .
no !
she wasn't around .
she was at her grandma's .
he was roller skating .
you know jason came up .
i know that .
i remember that .
you and jason get along today ?
okay ?
no ?
how come ?
because .
me and nicki hadta have a meeting .
meeting .
with each other .
about jason .
and nicki and niki's laughing .
and telling secrets and stuff .
but then jason .
was second or the third one .
he kept following us around .
so i went to my room .
with nicki .
and .
jason .
and then i came out one of these doors .
running near the door .
that was the best part of all !
and i could calm ?
him down .
you fooled him ?
i wasn't trying to .
no i know .
it's too bad you can't play with those boys who live next door here .
i know .
i really wanted to .
well sometimes you guys get along but .
sometimes you don't .
that's right .
you seem to get along okay once you go down to his house and start playing nintendo .
he can get kind of bossy .
he likes it too much .
he wants to .
he wants to .
he wants to take your !
turn just so he'll get be able to play .
because .
because .
invites me over to watch !
him .
no .
more lasagna please .
my gosh .
you're having thirds ?
adding ?
more .
actually i'm going to have thirds too .
well i didn't think we'd .
eat a whole thing of lasagna but jeez .
it's almost gone .
good thinking dad .
meow .
my thirds !
thirds .
this is a record for you .
think so ?
are you breaking the record ?
chi ate thirds for supper ?
it has been a while .
since i've ate so much .
here's your .
can you eat another piece of garlic bread ?
where's my first one ?
you must've ate it .
gee my second !
piece of garlic bread .
my third !
dish of lasagna .
how much can i eat ?
was your hair cooling off up in a bun on your head today ?
well .
there's two things we can do .
we can either keep it long enough so we can put it up in a bun .
or we .
can cut it short .
cut it short .
okay .
well maybe .
you and i should go to the hair dresser soon .
how about the day after tomorrow ?
no .
monday night .
tuesday night .
either of those nights would be good .
tuesday .
is that the day after tomorrow ?
day after tomorrow is monday .
then tuesday .
could cut it there .
you think so ?
that's pretty .
candles make shadows on the ceiling ?
i feel like a bit of my tooth fell out .
i don't think a bit !
of a tooth could have fallen out .
think you bit something that made your tooth feel funny ?
that is very soft .
it felt like my gum .
there's a little piece of garlic bread left .
guess i'll have to stop eating lasagna after this because there will not be any garlic bread to go with it .
what's that ?
another drink ?
it's tequila ?
you're squeezing lemon in it ?
drink it all ?
you eat the lemon after you drink tequila .
i guess you do .
lemon .
i wonder what i'll be when i grow up .
i can't make my mind up .
i can't make my mind up if i want to be a doctor .
a nurse .
or if i want to work in a l library .
if .
i want to be a librarian .
like moms .
you were thinking about being a teacher at one point too weren't you ?
i don't know if i'll be a teacher for a lot of kids .
that i have to handle .
well you've got plenty of time to decide .
i think the thing to do .
is to see what kind of things you like !
to do as you're growing up .
because that they might be the kinds of things you'd like to do .
for a job !
i don't know if i want to be .
working a store .
well .
maybe when you're a teenager you can get a job working in a store and see if you like it .
like big d ?
big d or a department store .
where they sell clothes and stuff .
i'd rather go to big d .
well that's nearby .
it would be a good job .
close ?
first job .
a lot of kids have jobs .
as teenagers .
and for things .
they're not planing on doing .
when they grow up .
but they're .
good jobs for teenagers to do .
because they can work for a few hours .
around school and stuff .
and in the summers .
well one thing to do is like .
if you think you're interested in teaching .
remember how you had .
kids at saint agnus ?
high school kids that came in and helped in the afternoon ?
there were kids from emmy's school ?
holy name ?
there was one girl from holy name that came in .
in the afternoons .
i forget what her name was .
teacher's helpers .
teacher's helpers like that .
they were high school students that came in and helped .
in the afternoons .
you could do something like that and try it to see if .
it's something you'd like to do when you grow up .
anyway .
i just found a face with hair .
little eyes .
lipstick and the hair .
did you find anything yet ?
i found lasagna to go on my fork .
i found a mountain .
you did ?
right there .
i'm making a little face .
mine is bald .
now i ate !
her .
the best thing to do .
yep .
i think thirds is probably .
as much as you should eat .
you don't want to get a bellyache .
you can finish your garlic bread .
with a couple bites .
any more ?
is that enough ?
well you certainly did very well tonight .
i have a small tummyache .
your head is as big as this .
your head is as big as this .
looks as if you got your fingers so close to your eyes .
that it's bigger then anything else .
what did you say ?
that small from here .
your head is .
that big from here .
no the further away you get from your eyes the bigger it's going to look .
now it's that !
big .
that !
big !
watch your fingers .
don't move your fingers .
i have a big head .
is that what you're saying .
no .
no .
probably because he needs a haircut .
i got big hair .
we all need haircuts ?
yes we do .
i look like one of these teenage girls with their teased hair ?
can i have the rest of your bread if your not going to eat it ?
chi .
clyde .
here want me to give your scraps to clyde chi ?
sure .
she's just like garfield .
come on kittie .
you garfield .
you big old garfield .
no room for dessert chi ?
what ?
should we have dessert later ?
later would be alright .
mom .
mom .
what ?
can we go upstairs ?
in a few minutes .
just sit and .
relax for a minute .
okay ?
sit on my lap ?
five .
whole .
dollars .
what are you going to do with five whole dollars ?
well .
you could save it for something useful .
maybe i could buy .
some barbie ?
bathing suits .
was there a doll you said you were saving it for ?
a daisy .
a daisy .
well .
sometime .
maybe if i save .
more than .
maybe if i save like .
a lot !
of money .
i could get both !
no .
i think you'd be saving for about a year .
those dolls i think cost about .
some of those dolls are kind of expensive .
twenty five to thirty dollars each .
that would make a hundred dollars .
well no .
right now you have five dollars .
you'd have to save .
five times more of your five dollars in order to buy one of those dolls .
so i would have to save .
twenty five .
dollars .
that would take quite a while .
it took you five weeks to save five !
dollars .
well she got a little bit ahead of the game .
four weeks .
four weeks and a tooth .
tooth falling out .
so that's .
but i don't think you're going to lose any more teeth .
you might be able to afford some of that ?
in a way .
save !
my money .
you can save it .
you can save it and buy one of the dolls .
one thing you might save it for is if we .
if save it you pay half and we'll pay half .
go to the beach this summer .
that's right .
you might .
bring some spending money .
buy something like shells or .
a sweatshirt .
no way .
no .
excuse me .
only the dolly .
well then save your money for the dolly .
for what ?
no idea .
no idea ?
save it for clothes .
or books .
could save it for .
eating ?
mcdonalds .
you could go to mcdonalds with your savings .
or .
maybe i could .
save it long enough you could go to a fancy restaurant .
chinese ?
nah .
you can save it for whatever is important to you .
what's important to me is dollies .
okay .
then .
save it for a dolly .
maybe we'll go to the store toy store in about a month .
because .
it's going to be close to mary's birthday and we'll needta get her .
something .
and you can look for something for yourself !
you'll have saved .
probably about ten dollars by then !
in a month .
you can certainly !
get something with ten dollars .
so .
five is ten .
so five plus ten will be fifteen .
with another month would be another four weeks .
so .
five weeks would be ten dollars .
so just about the time of mary's birthday you'd have .
ten dollars .
ten dollars ?
i might buy a doll .
i could buy a barbie doll .
you could .
probably .
ten dollars ?
maybe we'd help you out .
maybe we'd negotiate that .
you shouldn't chew on a scrap ?
well .
let's wait and see .
we'll have to look and see .
little mermaid barbie dolls .
we saw that on tv this morning .
they had little mermaid dolls out .
when i lose .
this tooth .
how much money will i get ?
it's up to the tooth fairy .
i don't .
keep the latest stock quotes on teeth .
i don't know .
those teeth you're going to have for a while .
those back teeth .
i think you've lost most of the ones you're going to lose .
right around this age .
she has got two more .
the ones beside her front two teeth .
will come out .
in the next year .
but .
it could be a year from now you know .
these two .
no .
no .
back ones and the square ones tend to come out later .
like when you're about .
ten or twelve .
well i remember when emmy was ten she lost a whole bunch of teeth all at once .
i lose them when i'm six !
well the front teeth you lose when you're around six to seven .
the back !
teeth you lose when you're ten to twelve .
so you have a couple more in the front these two pointy ones that are right next to where the big hole is today .
and that's probably it for a few years .
so you'll be rich for a little while because you lost all of your teeth but then .
you'll be poor until you start losing the back ones .
i will not be poor .
i'll be saving my money .
that's true .
my money teeth .
my money .
saving the money .
save the money .
save my .
my .
do you want to spell it ?
no .
what does it begin with ?
right !
right !
eee .
eee .
and then one letter at the end .
money .
it's a silent .
money .
or as the song says .
i know me .
is he ?
who's donald duck ?
the person sitting there is donald duck ?
i can't do it .
are you daisy duck ?
quack .
she's pretty good as her .
better than me .
nope nope no .
chi don't chew .
you're like a puppy .
chew your shoe .
that's what puppies do when they teethe .
chew on things .
we read a .
story in the paper .
a couple of weeks ago about a dog who stole .
all the tennis shoes and things like that in the neighborhood .
he took them off to a hill top .
i know .
because he was .
teething .
and finally somebody found out where he had taken all the shoes .
they went to the top of the hill and they found this big pile of old shoes .
sneakers and boots .
i need something to chew on that i carry .
well not your pocketbook handle .
it will not be a handle anymore .
you'll chew it .
and it'll break .
i don't do that .
you don't .
i suppose it's mice that come chew your barbie dolls's .
fingers .
i'm not doing that anymore .
good .
well i suppose i gotta get up and do dishes ?

timmy shouted .
tim pointed at a car coming up the lane .
well .
we'll have fun .
you and susan and me .
lassie wriggled all over and barked excitedly .
they would have fun .
the car .
what's wrong ?
the car pulled up and timmy's cousin susan opened the door .
susan hi yelled timmy .
running toward the car .
lassie barked happily .
boun .
bounding after him .
eek !
shrieked susan .
when she caught sight of lassie .
a dog !
make it go away .
and she scrambled back into the car and slammed the door .
lassie stopped barking .
she stopped wriggling .
susan timmy coaxed .
lassie's the nicest dog in the whole world .
she will not hurt you .
he looked down at lassie rubbing her head .
well lassie .
he said sadly i guess you'll have to be polite and stay away from susan until she gets used to you .
and so and so with drooping head and limp tail lassie lay down under the lilac bush and susan got out of the car .
she carried a doll a yellow haired doll wearing a soft blue dress .
this is maryann .
she said to timmy .
hugging her doll tightly .
she doesn't like dogs either .
and she marched into the house .
that night as lassie settled down on her rug next to timmy's dad .
he whispered don't feel sad lassie .
tomorrow we'll make susan like you .
and so after breakfast the next morning .
timmy and lassie played ball .
but susan .
well .
she j she just sat on the steps and changed .
maryann's dress .
later timmy and lassie played dressup .
susan didn't play .
though she was busy having a make-believe tea party with maryann .
but !
lassie thought she saw susan smile once .
watching them play .
after dinner lassie did tricks .
she shook hands with timmy .
she said please for a cookie .
and she rolled over and played dead !
and with that susan laughed .
she laughed right out .
out loud .
timmy was pleased and proud .
lassie he said shake hands with susan .
happily lassie moved ?
forward but then make her go away .
shrieked susan .
as she darted into the house .
timmy sighed alright susan he called you don't have to be friends with lassie if you don't want to .
come on i'll show you the creek .
timmy and susan had fun putting toys on dry leaves .
and watching as the little boats moved out into the swirling waters of the creek .
lassie lying behind a log watched them playing until her eyelids slowly drooped .
shut .
suddenly timmy spied a piece of wood .
lying nearby .
look !
he said .
wood for a real boat !
he tied a piece of string to it and sent it out into the stream .
then he pulled it back .
out and back out and back .
susan looked down at maryann .
and had an idea .
maryann would you like a boat ride ?
she said and so then the little boat went out with a passenger on it .
timmy and susan watched their little boat bob in the water .
then timmy started to bring it back to shore .
suddenly the little boat .
teetered .
teetered .
maryann wobbled and then as timmy and susan .
susan watched she slipped into the water and was carried down the stream .
maryann !
susan wailed how will we get her back ?
timmy looked around .
lassie .
he called .
where are you ?
but lassie was asleep .
her nose twitching gently as a fly buzzed near .
timmy and susan ran along the bank following the bobbing doll .
lassie timmy called again desperately .
still lassie didn't hear .
but suddenly the bothersome fly settled squarely on her nose .
her eyes flew open .
she snuffed fiercely and then she heard timmy's call .
lassie !
with a bound she was on her feet .
looking around for timmy .
then she was she was down at the water's edge .
maryann cried susan .
pointing .
lassie get maryann .
cried timmy .
lassie splashed into the water and headed for maryann .
swimming fast she fl she followed the doll down the stream .
slowly she drew near .
at last she reached out caught maryann's dress in her teeth .
and turned back toward the bay .
lassie dropped the wet but safe maryann in the grass .
stopped long enough to shake the water from her coat .
and then she headed back for her place in the sun .
she lay down and closed her eyes .
but then at the sound of light .
foot steps !
lassie opened her eyes .
susan hugging maryann .
dropped down beside her .
lassie she said softly holding out her hand .
maryann and i we'd like to shake hands with you .
you're the nicest dog .
anywhere .
who is .
you bet you bet !
said timmy and now will not we have fun .

lassie barked happily .
as she shook hands with susan .

they hunted for more then an hour but no one found him that white puppy with black paws and black ears .
so each policeman decided to hunt in a special place .
the first fat policeman went to look in the field across from the schoolhouse .
there he heard a .
it was a soft sad .
that bird couldn't be happy .
there far out on a branch was a yellow canary bird with a black stripe on each wing !
the bird looked lost and sounded very lonely .
the first fat policeman took him gently in his hand .
the second fat policeman went to look in the narrow lane behind the shops on main street .
he heard a meow .
it was a soft sad meow .
that cat couldn't be happy .
there behind a big rubbish .
can was a small orange kitten .
the kitten looked lost and sounded very lonely .
the second fat policeman took her gentle in his arms .
the third !
fat policeman went to look in the woods beyond the railroad tracks .
there he heard nothing but the wind blowing through the trees .
he was many anu .
animal footprints tracking back and forth in and out and across muddy paths .
all the way into the fields beside cross old mr dump's house .
the three policemen met in the square in front of the town hall .

now .
debbie has mentioned something to natasha's mom .

mom .
why does chi always have to .

why does she always have to have an appointment ?
she's been having this for a long time .
they always want her to recor they always want you to record something .
they want to see how her her language is .
she's in a study .
so that's why ?
like one one day when she said .

especially a few people in our classroom and such .
is that .
after you read the text .
go and read the workbook .

based more on the workbook .
mostly .
on the way things are worded in the workbook than the way they're worded in the text .
i haven't even read the workbook .

just a little .
bagel segment .
and a .
you are funny ?

as my father used to .
if if you didn't finish something .
it would reappear magically at breakfast !
this is breakfast .
no i mean if you didn't finish something at dinner .
for dinner .
would reappear magically at breakfast and then .
like your asparagus ?
broccoli and brussels sprouts i remember vividly .
and then it would reappear at lunch .
and so on .
hadta keep .
you had !
to eat .
your food .
before it spoiled ?
well .
i think once my sister .
pushed the limits of that one .
guys !
mom .
i think this went on for days .
mom remember .
visitors are coming today .
she .
would not eat the brussels sprouts .
remember ?

blame me .
do you want a strawberry ?
nah i'm full .
okay .
strawberries ?
no thanks .
no thanks too .
no .
i just ?
remember crawling around under the kitchen and trying to .
discard my brussels sprouts .
and hoping everyone would actually believe that i really ate it .
all the way to the kitchen and back .
yes .
i ate my brussel sprout in the kitchen .
of course my mother found it .
in the disposal .
i see .
and .
let me ask you something .
were the brussels sprouts mandatory ?
i mean .
like how did they get onto your plate in the first place ?
they were there .
they they i do not like brussels sprouts .
they're the worst things i've ever tasted !
actually .
brussels sprouts are alright .
it's asparagus i don't like .
i like asparagus .
i don't like brussels sprouts .
i like everything green .
i love asparagus .
i have had brussels sprouts a couple of times when they've been fresh .
and they've been .
and they've with hollandaise they're not bad .
but these .
because you cover up the taste !
see that's that's .
they're not bad with hollandaise !
if they're fresh .
that's the whole point of hollandaise sauce .
can i see a knife so i can cut this ?
but these .
or .
the ones in question though are these .
top off ?
frozen .
little brussels sprout bombs .
go get a knife okay ?
you don't eat frozen vegetables .
they're nasty .
all frozen vegetables are nasty .
guess nobody wanted a yogurt .
i'll have a yogurt .
i love !
yogurt .
there's blueberry too .
love it .
have some .
what ?
what are you watching your potassium or something ?
strawberries are good !
what's ?
this ?
strawberry thing .
i like strawberries .
apparently so .
the only thing about strawberries i don't like .
which i was given once .
by this .
very rude woman in mississippi .
strawberry wine .
in ponchitulla .
ew .
had strawberry wine .
i remember we had this strange !
lunch over with this lady's house .
and .
and .
it it was .
in some sort of odd .
odd spaghetti and .
something casserole .
strawberry festival ?
wine ?
really .
strange .
next !
and then .
the ones that are not .
mushy .
and when we went over .
went ?
back home and we were telling jessie mae about it .
down and up .
jessie mae used to cook for her .
miss dottie ?
sure can cook some peculiar things !
it's just better if she stays away from the kitchen !
vanilla !
yes .
vanilla .
there's more in the fridge if you want .
there's blueberry over here or there's more in the refrigerator .
nah .
no .
i just want to see what it looked like .
that would have been very sweet .
that's all .
and .
very disgusting .
yes .
my yogurt tastes a tastes a little vague ?
it's strawberry .
it's supposed to look like that .
doesn't taste like strawberry .
it tastes like .
you know like those mineral waters that have a hint !
of something .
no .
well what did you add .
no !
to it .
why ?
because the strawberries in here are pureed .
so .
i don't like the little seeds .
they bother me .
why ?
they bother my gums .
they get in .
into my gums .
infected ?
add a strawberry .
what ?
add a strawberry .
might want to stir that up a little .
seems a little chunky .
yogurt is like that .
although if you put whole strawberries that's going to be very chunky .
would you like a strawberry ?
i'm eating all the strawberries .
in one day .
well one morning .
i'm going to put some in your lunch for school .
goody thank you .

pick them .

we'd end up with bloody fingers .
from all the thorns that were around them but .
you probably ate them without washing them ?

just in a .
regular house .

she can go out there and be stupid if she want to .
cou could you hand me that little cup in there please .
i told she gotta concentrate on trying to get your life together .
get a job so you can have some money .
all you going to think about i keep ?
thinking about boys all the time and you don't even know how to clean your room up !
gosh .
little girl what'd i tell you .
put it in !
there don't throw them in there .
i mean if she was a contributing grownup like kenny is .
kenny paid his way in this house .
erika don't do nothing .
don't even clean up .
and when she do wash dishes she leaves more food on the dishes than was on them before she washed them .
that's your baby .
then you'd have these kind of privileges .
put the napkins away ?

we see adrienne occasionally .
but we but i i still haven't seen her since then but ken and erika did they saw her out .
say she's kenny saw her yesterday said she was going to come back here but she ain'hasn't showed up yet .
let them be .
she reminds me of erika when she was little .
she looks a little like her .
just hope she don't turn out to be erika like erika when she get to be big .
leave her alone .
you never .
i will not leave alone .
i mean can't depend on her to do nothing .
can't depend on her to be around to watch the kids .
you can't depend on her to wash dishes .
you can't depend on her to do nothing but fly the street .
fly in the street hanging in the street more than ken'd do .
i said ken is the boy you would think supposed to be the one hanging out and staying out all night .

she didn't get her popcorn either did she ?
right here .
no i mean she didn't take it with her .

that's true .
so if she comes in in the next five minutes or so she can make it .

they must get out and have an extra period or something .

the kids picked up two bricks off the ground and threw them in the water .
he comes over and says .
they gotta keep the water clean and whatever .
and they they climbed over on the other side .
and i just told both of them .
don't !
go over there .
right ?
and and they weren't listening so i'm standing there making sure they don't fall in on their faces .
the guy comes over and starts yelling .

i didn't know what to say .
do you know that this is federal property .
i went .

i'm making this into .
a forest .
okay .
remember we were talking about we were reading a story about elephants ?
somebody lost his tusk .
two hippos .
they're hippos .
that's right .
a baby hippo .
a zebra .
isn't it cute .
and .
what's this thing ?
what's this thing ?
a female lion ?
a lioness ?
it's a female lion .
and .
let's see .
chi what's behind you ?
any anything behind you ?
because there used to be dinosaurs in the forest .
well .
two kinds .
well .
two little baby giraffes .
aren't they cute ?
too bad this one can't stand up .
i got an idea .
no that's a bad idea .
right sometimes .
this could be a grass stand .
so we could it could be standing on grass .
okay .
want to help ?
the same idea !
they're very similar alright .
what we'll do is that .
you say it stands in the bushes a lot .
i'm going to make a ramp !
okay .
i'll make a ramp with these two .
so .
this going to be the mud here ?
yep .
this is it .
put the lions up there .
chi .
what do you think ?
good !
well these guys are playing .
they're playing in the in the mud .
right !
well i'm !
building this thing that's going to be .
a places for .
all the cars to go on .
the cars ?
in the jungle ?
right !
didn't people used to come in the jungle to take the elephant's tusks ?
so !
what does that tell you ?
they could be getting tusks .
bet they have roads somewhere yes .
yes they are having a road .
a very hard road .
good !
make it harder so to protect the elephant the less people the less tusks being left .
i don't think these animals are going to want to be near this road i tell you .
that's okay it's going to be real hard .
what ?
the elephant can see some road there .
know what he's going to do ?
he's going to jump up there .
he's going to warn !
all the other animals !
where's the other car ?
where's the other car ?
come on car .
me too !
really looks to me like the kind of cars people used to ride through jungles .
but the big !
one is more like a landrover .
that first one that you had ?
well .
you're mr fixer ?
well i guess if they had dinosaurs in the jungle they might as well be useful .
right !
to guard you .
excuse me .
we're !
nobody messes with the buttermobile .
no no !
go get them !
i ain't going to let them in and take these tusks .
forget it !
how come you're fighting me ?
because .
we want they're friendly .
they're giving us food .
they're not friendly .
they're going to take the elephant's tusks !
no they ain't !
look !
do we have anything to take these tusks ?
no we don't .
look chi you told !
me this .
these guys are coming .
they're always here because come and take the tusks .
right !
they used !
to !
but now these days they come here and take them to the zoo so people can see them .
well you got me stumped now because it's hard to say .
what i think about that .
i'm i'm really glad that we have zoos and all but maybe these animals are happy here .
i mean these guys have their mud .
i know they're going to have lots of mud in the town .
no this one should go .
maybe someone will take care of him up there .
right !
and the lions .
you're going to take the babies !
you're going to take the little babies of the of the hippos ?
i don't think the zoo people actually separate them from their parents maybe .
no !
they're going to take the parents with them .
because .
they're going to use that big car .
okay .
i'll go along with it .
it's a nice zoo ?
right !
we're going to take all the animals .
and we're g especially going to take him .
we're going to make him stand up .
the baby he does need help .
i think the jungle's a bad place for an animal who has a bad leg .
okay .
okay we'll take i'll take the zebra .
hello zebra .
want a little giraffe chi ?
okay .
no .
i'll bust the road .
what ?

well usually the guys in corvettes are bad guys .
what ?
that car .
you don't have no permission to do this .
these are nice ones .
how come ?
i know where they got them .
because they're bigger and they're heavier they're not the kind of plastic that you squeeze .

simpsons on .
the simpsons are on ?
he thinks this is a bridge .
he's so dumb he doesn't know ?
he doesn't know they're brontosauruses .
mom who is this ?
well .
they give them weird names that aren't the names that are in the books for these guys chi .
mom why don't they just call all these brontosauruses and why don't they call the ones with longer necks bro i mean allosauruses ?
i don't know because depend it seems like depending on what book you read they're all different names .
this one says he was fourteen meters long .
you're going to have to teach me meters chi .
how come ?
we didn't do that when i was in school .
this one was twenty two meters long .
he was eight meters longer than him .
what do you mean .
he's bigger ?
well i think you can tell that by looking at him can't you ?
because his neck is little .
why don't they call him the allosaurus ?
yow !
look out a brontosaurus !
i don't know i never heard that name allosaurus until we were reading that one book chi i never heard of an allosaurus .
but that is him isn't it ?
his long old neck .
mom !
and there's another dinosaur called brachiosaurus .
i know .
him i remember .
this guy must be brachiosaurus .
isn't brachiosaurus the one with the bump on its head ?
he doesn't have the bump on his head .
you know what the bump's on his head for ?
what ?
an echo .
an echo chamber .
didn't you get that off riders ?
no .
that's what your book said ?
no .
it's on that dinosaur movie that we got from that tyrannosaurus .
you mean that's how he hears and tells where things are .
it's like sonar ?
n no n no no he echoes from it .
that's weird .
i'm going to have to watch that movie with you so i can see what you mean .
because even duck bills have some .
mot !
you know more about dinosaurs than i do !
excuse me i don't want this in the way .
mot they're in trouble here come hippopotamus .

he built a small house called a cocoon .
this is a cocoon .
then how can he fit in that !
little hole ?
no he's see he build it around himself .
he's inside of it .
he stayed inside for more than two weeks .
and then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon and pushed his way out .
then he became a beautiful .
ful butterfly .
because in that hole he turned into a butterfly .
first he .
turned into .
this .
and then .
when he came out he turned into a a huge .
dude with wings .

no you can't said mrs bear .
it's bathtime .
anyway .
you'd have to find a rocket first .

i know this .
thing .
he makes a rocket .
baby bear found a rocket in the closet under the stairs .
there's a secret passage .
on this picture ?
see there's a little crack .
yep .
that means there's a secret passage .
secret passage ?
and anyway .
he see that's doesn't have lines but i mean ?
there's a door right there .
you're right .
you're very smart .
so he opened up the door and what do you think is inside ?
a rocket .
you're right .
and then what did he do ?
he dug in to see if there was .
anything in there .
then he made a a rocket .
i didn't know a cat was up there !
then he found a friend owl .
then he headed for the .
the the airport !
they he landed right on the moon .
then they had a picnic .
what're they having at their picnic ?
they're having juice a cookie .
soda pop .
honey apple .
cheese and .
a cookies .
soup ?
you you want to know what he has on his head here ?
what ?
you know why i think that's so funny ?
why ?
that's a colander .
you know what we do with a colander ?
what .
we put our lettuce in it and wash it off and put our fruit in it .
it has holes in it .
and we wash it off .
it's what he has got on his head .
that's funny .
now what happens ?
he flies back to his own earth .
can you see ?
and they're landing back .
goodbye friend owl !
he said that .
then the rain came .
hiding in the back .
and the side .
how does he get back into his house ?
he fell through the chimney .
just like .
who ?
who else goes through the chimney ?
santa .
he just .
puts stays on the box and .
stay inside of the chimney .
i see that .
what's .
then then he gets in the hot bath .
his mom probably wants to know why he's so dirty .
look .
but he .
look .
what did he leave on the side of the tub ?
footprints and mud ?
and soot ?
everywhere .
and now what ?
where's he going ?
to bed .
to bed .
do you want to look at this book ?
sure .
okay .
this is a book about elephants .
you read it .
you want me to read it ?
okay .
elephants are the largest land animals .
this baby looks tiny beside its mother .
see the baby ?
he is !
pretty tiny .
and he doesn't have these like his father .
know what these are called ?
what .
tusks .
yep and .
when my human you you know my .
world my human ?
book .
that we had .
well .
i saw these men taking off these and they they fried him into a hamburger .
they fried the elephant into a hamburger ?
well you know it's true .
anabella told me that .
anabella told you that ?
she knows .
well you know what you saw that's really right ?
i don't know if they fry them into hamburgers but they do take their tusks and they make jewelry out of it and it's really unique .
i don't want to .
kill the elephant .
no that's what they do .
they kill them and they take them .
and it's called ivory .
and they make .
stuff out of it .
what's all those red things ?
part of the book .
so .
but we will not do that okay ?
we will not eat any elephant burgers .
yep .
okay .
but when the baby was born it weighed two hundred pounds .
and was about three feet tall .
it grew inside its mother for over one year and ten months .
more than a year longer than a human baby needs to grow inside its mother .
i thought i thought baby elephants get need they push them into it .
i i didn't know they were so heavy .
they're really big .
because their mommies are really big too .
and their daddies too .
yep .
a baby elephant is called a calf .
a mother elephant usually gives birth to one calf at a time .
she will not give birth again until her calf is about three years old .
a baby elephant may drink its mother's milk until it is four or five years old .
like i am .
it curls .
yep you're five !
it curls back its trunk while it's feeding .
see ?
yep just like a mommy baby cow .
yep you're right .
that's what it looks like .
you hate that noise .
only when you're eating .
when i'm drinking .
there are two kinds of elephants .
asian and african .
this is a female asian elephant .
asian elephants are not as tall as african .
as as their african cousins .
which one is it ?
they said this one's an asian elephant .
i wonder why it has a furry stuff on chin ?
i don't know .
let's see if it'll ?
explain it .
they also have smaller ears and smaller tusks .
the female .
called a cow .
often has no tusks at all .
they call her a cow .
see she doesn't have any tusks .
and she's furry .
so that's why they don't kill .
these ones .
because they don't have any .
tusks .
to make them into jewelry .
you might be right about that .
that would be a good guess .
they only turn .
the ones that have these .
into jewelry .
and that one doesn't have it so .
they don't want to turn that one to to jewelry .
right .
yep .
so the asian ones they probably don't kill .
and then maybe it's the african ones that get killed .
because this is an african elephant .
and .
these ones don't have !
these .
male elephants are called bulls .
african elephants have a dip in their backs .
they also have ridges on their trunks .
which end in two points .
asian elephants have a smoother trunk that ends in one point .
see there what they talk about the dip in the backs ?
see how it goes down like that ?
like a camel .
like a camel .
well it's it's the opposite .
see this one comes up like that ?
and this one goes down .
like a skateboard thing .
they have a .
like a skateboard ramp .
your dad would be really proud of you to know that you know what a skateboard ramp looks like .
his used be a nasty ?
skate boarder .
i know i saw that in the kitchen .
that's funny .
okay .
let's see here .
sit back .
the elephant's nearest living relative is a small furry creature called a .
hyrax ?
there's .
i read it .
there's a couple of things in here i had certainly never known what they are .
they give you some books that the parents can't even pronounce the words in .
i read that .
is this it ?
yes .
this is a hyrax .
sure is like a gerbil .
it looks like a gerbil doesn't it .
can you believe this is related to an elephant ?
i don't know .
these hyraxes live in rocky holes in africa .
they don't look much like elephants but their feet are like elephants's feet .
only much smaller !
look .
okay .
this is funny .
this is called a sea cow .
give me a break man .
it's true .
that's what it says .
okay if you can quit mommy laughing so hard we can read this book .
okay the sea cow is called it's called a manatee .
okay .
it's called a manatee but they also call it a sea cow .
let's see .
sea cows are shy creatures that never leave the water .
their skin and teeth are like an elephant's .
some sea cows have even small trunks .
even have small trunks .
look at these elephants .
they're cute .
i bet they turn these babies into jewelry .
they are !
cute .
maybe .
because see they have .
these .
tusks .
here's asian .
asian elephants often live in forests and swamps .
this asian cow elephant lives in nepal .
a small country north of india .
you can see her small ears and her very small tusks .
can you see them ?
right there .
she has just got little ones .
i wonder why she's called a cow .
they call this one a cow ?
cow elephant .
i don't know .
that's just what they call the girls .
cow elephant .
these are so weird .
african elephants live in the plains as well as the forest .
this african elephant lives in the open grassland .
it flaps its huge ears to help keep cool in the hot african sunshine .
big ears .
do you see all those birds with him ?
yep .
going on the back .
have you seen pictures of elephants with all the birds sitting on their backs ?
no .
it's funny you can see it on tv .
they all sit on the backs of the elephants .
like .
and they sit on their trunks ?
i don't think so .
only on their backs .
because if they sat up front what do you think the elephant would do ?
yep .
throw them all in the garbage can .
why do you think they sit on his back ?
i don't know .
they get a free ride probably .
okay look at all these elephants .
do you see some baby ones in there ?
yep right there .
and right there and .
right there right there right there right there .
all of them are babies .
there's a baby one !
look at the color of this elephant .
woo .
elephants do not eat meat .
did you know that ?
i didn't know that .
they don't eat any meat .
i thought they did eat .
i thought they did .
no they eat grass and leaves and fruit and bark .
what's bark ?
as much as .
you know what bark is ?
no .
it's the outside of the tree .
it's like the skin of the tree .
see that's why he's reaching up right there .
to get the bark .
that's the part of the tree you can chip off if you want to .
like like this ?
and like this .
they eat the outside of the tree .
yep .
that's what he ate .
you're right .
they eat two hundred and fifty pounds a day !
of grass and leaves and fruit and bark .
they use their trunks to reach up onto the high branches and they tear up the plants and strip the bark off the trees .
i guess they don't want to eat the plant part they just want the bark .
they use their tusks to dig for salt .
they also dig holes in dry river beds to find water .
then other thirsty animals come and drink the water too .
that's neat i didn't know that either .
look how much he dug .
you think he dug all that up ?
was he looking for some water ?
i think .
he was looking for some salt .
why do you think he needs salt ?
to eat .
why would he want to eat salt ?
well they it says they .
use their trunk to dig for salt .
yep .
that's what it's saying .
salt .
salt and .
do you know we're looking one ?
they look like stones .
they're white .
elephants drink an amazing amount of water .
about fifty gallons a day !
that's fifty milk bottles .
you know those big milk bottles that we have ?
the really really big ones .
he drinks fifty of those a day .
that's why they're all white ?
no .
maybe it'll explain why they're white .
they suck up quarts of water into their trunks at a time and then squirt the water down their throats .
they also bathe by squirting the water from their trunks all over their bodies .
they give them a bath .
why do they squirt at people ?
they probably do .
look it's going to talk about how they take a bath .
maybe we can find out why they're white .
let's see .
elephants love to take baths .
they are good swimmers and they like to .
i can't see if you put your head down .
they like to splash around in the water .
i can't talk .
okay .
you have to read the book now .
no alright !
okay .
calm down .
calm down .
read it .
alright .
because they drink so much and enjoy swimming so much .
elephants needta live near a lot of water .
you know .
okay i guess we're not going to read .
no .
can you calm down a little bit ?
yes .
thomas ?
you're banging me and the taperecorder okay ?
no sit down .
because you you needta relax a little bit .
okay ?
so did you catch any of that ?
they needta live near the water because they like to drink so much of it .
elephants are often bothered by flies and other insects .
to get rid of them .
why ?
because the flies like to hover around them and and .
fly near them .
and other bugs .
like maybe mosquitoes or .
okay ?
they often get rid of them by bake i see .
by taking mud baths .
this group of african elephants looks red because they have been rolling in red mud .
elephants live and travel in groups called herds .
a herd may be a few animals or a few hundred .
so did you get that ?
they roll around in the mud to keep the bugs off of them .
which is why they look orange .
because it's orange mud .
so that explains it .
i thought they said .
i thought they said red .
they probably did say red .
they said red .
you know what that might be why these ones are white .
maybe they rolled around in some mud that turned white .
to keep the bugs off .
most of the time elephants are peaceful animals .
they usually charge only if they are threatened .
bull elephants get very excitable and angry for a few weeks or months about once a year .
this is called being in please .
that's the other word that i have trouble with .
it's some some african word probably from that i don't understand .
what is it ?
i don't know .
zoo elephants must be kept by themselves during this particular time of their life .
look at those two elephants .
what're they doing ?
what does it look like they're doing .
looks like they're kissing each other .
or maybe giving each other a bath .
probably squirting each other .
through ?
her nose .
what's this ?
that's a sticker on your nose .
calm down .
calm down .
i'm not going to read if you're going to be wild .
alright alright .
okay ?
you all set ?
yep .
elephants are very smart animals .
they are even .
they there are even schools for asian elephants .
they are taught to drag piles of heavy logs and load them onto trucks .
elephants also carry people .
like these men with their bundles of grass .
these asian elephants are being rounded up to be trained for work .
african elephants are not as easy to train .
often they are killed for their ivory tusks .
even though this is against the law .
elephants deserve better treatment than this .
it's just what we were talking about isn't it ?
okay that's the end of the book .
okay .
i know how to read that .

i'll read it .

by mary hoffman .
elephants .
i can see ma !
elephants are the largest land animals .
l listen up because you can learn from this okay ?
this baby looks tiny beside its mother .
but when it was born it weighed two hundred pounds .
and was about three feet tall .
it grew up inside its mother for over one year and ten months .
more than a year longer than a human baby needs to grow inside its mother .
a baby elephant is called a calf .
is it a or a calf ?
calf .
calf okay .
a mother elephant i never heard they're called ?
something .
a mother elephant usually gives birth to one calf at a time .
she will not give birth again until her calf is about three years old .
a baby elephant may drink its mother's milk .
i'm three .
you're three years old .
until it is four or five years old .
it curls back its trunk while feeding .
chi's five .
shh .
there are two kinds of elephants .
asian and african .
this is a female asian elephant .
asian elephants are not as tall as their african cousins .
they also have a smaller ears and tusks .
the female .
called a cow .
often has no tusks at all .
you like elephants ?
what's that ?
this is an african elephant .
male elephants are called bulls .
african elephants have a dip in their backs .
what is a dip ?
how come ?
see right here ?
how come ?
you see this one doesn't have one because it's an asian afri asian .
elephant .
elephant .
and this one is a .
african elephant you see it goes it goes down !
instead of going up like that ?
that's different ?
ma how come they do that ?
how come ?
that's how god made it .
alright ?
what happened to the dip ?
they also have ridges on their trunks .
which end in two points .
asian elephants have smoother trunks that end in just one point .
where's where's the baby one ?
the baby one's back here .
we missed it .
now we're going to listen to little little .
hyrax .
the elephant's nearest living relative is a small furry creature called a hyrax .
what's that ?
hyraxes live on the in the rock rocky holes in africa .
mom .
mommy .
they don't look much like elephants but their feet are like elephants's .
feet only much smaller !
what's that ?
another c close relative of the elephant is a sea cow .
it's a sea !
cow !
looks ugly ?
it doesn't look like a sea cow to me .
well we never seen one so we don't know what it looks like .
looks ugly .
looks ugly .
right ?
mom .
this sea cow is called a .
how do you say this word ?
i manatee i think but i haven't before this book i hadn't heard of that either !
manatee .
sea cows are shy creatures we never seen this at sea world before .
shy creatures that never leave the water .
their skin and teeth are like an elephants's .
sea some sea cows even have small tusks .
look at the baby elephant !
okay .
asian elephants often live in forests and swamps .
baby elephants .
the asian cow elephant lives in nepal .
a small country north of india .
you can see her small ears and her small very small tusks .
as african elephants live in the plains as well as forests .
this african elephant lives in the open grassland .
it flaps its huge ears to help its ?
keep cool in the hot african sunshine .
see those ears are bigger than this one see that ?
how come ?
these are african .
elephants .
and these asian .
see how there different .
ears ?
see we all have different size ears too .
no they don't .
see that ?
that's different .
just like just like us ?
and feet .
look at all those elephants .
looks like there's someone there .
no pic no words ?
no .
just pictures .
elephants do not eat meat .
they eat grass leaves fruit and bark .
as much as two hundred and fifty pounds a day !
they use their trunks to reach high branches .
tear up plants .
and strip the bark of trees .
they use their tusks to dig for salt .
they also dig holes in dry river beds to find water .
then other thirsty animals come and drink the water too .
elephants drink an amazing amount of water .
about fifty gallons a day .
they suck up quarts of water into their trunks at a time then squirt the water down their throats .
they also bathe by squirting the water from their trunks all over their bodies .
they're a different color of elephant look at how they're different colors .
white .
i never seen them like that before .
not me either .
elephants love to take baths .
they are good swimmers and they like to splash around in the water .
because they drink so much and enjoy swimming so much .
elephants needta live near a lot of water .
elephants are often bothered by flies and other insects .
they get rid of them by taking mud .
mud baths .
this group of african elephants look red because they have been rolling in red mud .
elephants live and travel in groups called herds .
a herd may be a few animals or a few hundred .
most of the time elephants are peaceful animals .
they usually charge only if they are threatened .
but elephants get very excitable and angry for a few weeks or months about once a year .
this is called being in the .
zoo elephants must be kept by themselves during musth .
zoo ?
i don't know if i'm pronouncing it right .
elephant ?

nope .
nope .
elephants are very smart animals .
there are even schools for asian elephants .
they are taught to drag piles of heavy logs and load them onto trunks trucks .
elephants also carry people .
like these men with their bundles of grass .
see that ?
carrying people .
these asian elephants are being rounded up to be trained for work .
african elephants are not as easy to train .
often they are killed for their ivory tusks .

they like to splash and play in the water .
these elephants .
roll in the mud to keep the flies away .

well when they get on the elephants it bothers them a lot .
so they .
take baths in the mud and it helps get rid of them .
see it says these elephants look red because they have been rolling around in the mud .

that's their trunk .
you mean their nose .
well kind of .

jimmy durante .
asian elephants have smoother trunks that end in just one point .
look .
the elephant's nearest living relative is a small furry creature called a hyrax .
aren't they cute ?
they look a little like mice .
these hyraxes live in rocky holes in africa .
they don't look much like elephants but their feet are like elephants's feet .
only much smaller !
another close relative of the elephant is the sea cow .
this sea cow is called a manatee .
sea cows are shy creatures .
that never leave the water .
their skin and teeth are like an elephant's .
some sea cows even have small tusks .
wouldn't you like to see an elephant ?
i want to ride on a horse too .

and her very small tusks .
see ?
i can see that right here it's a little small .
looks like a little tooth .
i know .
afrin ele a african elephants live in the plains as well as forests .
this african elephant lives in the open grassland .
it flaps its huge ears to help keep cool .
in the hot african sun .
would you like to have ears that big .
so you could cool yourself off ?
no .
sometimes it would be nice .
look .

i'd like to go to africa someday and see that .
i don't know !
elephants do not eat meat .
they eat grass leaves fruit and bark .
as much as two hundred and fifty pounds a day !
glad i don't have to feed him .
i know .
they use their trunks to reach high branches .
i know what else they eat peanuts .
they tear up plants .
and strip the bark off trees .
they use their tusks to dig for salt .
they also dig holes in dry river beds to find water .
then other thirsty animals come and drink the water too .
do you know why they need salt ?
so that they don't sweat out all the water that they take .
in the heat .
look at that !
one !

i know .
he looks like he's grey too .
elephants drink an amazing of amount of water .
i know how he gets clean .
he drinks about fifty gallons a day !
they suck up quarts of water into their trunk at a time .
then squirt the water down their throats .
they also bathe by squirting the water from their trunks all over their bodies .
elephants love to take baths .
you must be an elephant !
you love to take a bath .
but i'm not an elephant .
okay .
they are good swimmers and they like to splash around in the water .
mommy isn't he cute ?
because they drink so much and enjoy swimming so much .
elephants needta live near a lot !
of water .
elephants are often bothered by flies and other insects .
they get rid of them by taking mud baths .

this group of african elephants looks red because they have been rolling in red mud .
elephants live and travel in groups called herds .

no thanks but .
okay .
i still love you .
a herd may be a few animals or a few hundred .
most of the time elephants are peaceful animals .

bull elephants get very excitable .
and angry for a few weeks or months about once a year .
this is called being in .
musth ?
zoo elephants must be kept by themselves during musth .

they are there are even schools for asian elephants .
they are taught to drag piles of heavy logs and load them onto trucks .
elephants also carry people .
like these men with their bundles of grass .
these asian elephants are being rounded up to be trained for work .
african elephants are not as easy to train .
often they are killed for their ivory tusks .
even though this is against the law .
elephants deserve better treatment than this .
i agree .

they also dig holes in dry river beds to find water .
then other thirsty animals come and drink the water too .
elephants drink an amazing amount of water .
about fifty gallons a day .

they get rid of them by taking mud .
mud baths .
this group of african elephants look red because they have been rolling in red mud .
elephants live and travel in groups called herds .
a herd may be a few animals or a few hundred .

elephants are the largest land animals .
this baby looks tiny besides its mother beside its mother .
but when it was born it weighed two hundred pounds .
and was about three feet tall .

more than a year longer than a human baby needs to grow inside its mother .

the babies .
that's how they get their milk and their food .
there are two kinds of elephants .

the african ones are taller then the asian ones .
they also have smaller ears and tusks .

right ?
the asian one .

they also have ridges on their trunks .
which end in two points .
they also have ridges on their trunks which end in two points .
down here .
down there .
asian elephants have smoother trunks that end in just one !
point .
so their their trunks are smoother .
the elephant's nearest living relative is a small furry creature called a hyrax ?
these hyraxes live in rocky holes in africa .
they don't look much like elephants but their feet are like elephants like elephants's feet .
only much smaller !
can you believe that those are like cousins .
to the elephant .
and they're so much smaller .
another close relative of the elephant is the sea cow .
this sea cow is called a manatee .
sea cows are shy creatures that never !
leave the water .
their skin and teeth are like an elephant's .
some sea cows even have small tusks .
they probably come out there .
what's different about the sea cow from an elephant ?
where does it live ?
in the water .
in the water .
and the elephant lives where ?
out of the water .
out of the water on land .
right .
there they are .
asian elephants often live in forests and swamps .
this asian cow elephant lives in nepal .
a small country north of india .
you can see her small you can see her small ears and her very small tusks .
african elephants live in the plains as well as the forests .
this african elephant lives in the open grassland .
bird .
yep he's on the front ?
that's right .
same picture !
very good .
african elephants live in the plains as well as forests .
know what the plains are ?
what ?
it's flat land and it's grassy .
and there's not many trees .
so it's like that .
whereas in the forest where the asian elephants live .
there's a lot of trees .
and water .
there's not as much water on the plains in africa .
what ?
and there is an open grassland .
see how open it is ?
it flaps its huge ears to help keep cool in the hot african sunshine .
you know how you have a fan and go like that .
that's what they do with their ears to cool them off .
is full-page picture a forest or a pl or a plain ?
plain .
right .
elephants do not eat meat .
they eat grass .
leaves .
elephants do not eat meat .
they eat grass leaves fruit and bark .
as much as two hundred and fifty pounds a day !
they use their trunks to reach high branches .
see ?
they tear up the plant they use their trunks to tear up plants .
and strip the bark off trees .
you know how trees sometimes you can peel something off of it ?
it's a hard .
but they can .
do that with their trunks .
instead of plants .
they eat it .
they use their tusks to dig for salt .
see how it's doing that ?
it's digging it right into the ground .
they also dig holes in dry river beds to find water .
then other thirsty animals come and drink the water too .
so they can dig into the ground with their tusks and then water will come up .
and then they have something to drink .
elephants drink an amazing amount of water .
about fifty gallons a day !
that's a lot of water .
they suck up quarts of water into their trunks .
they they suck up quarts !
of water .
into their trunks at a time .
then squirt the water down their throats .
down their throats .
they also bathe by squirting the water from their trunks all over their bodies .
like a hose .
and then they spray !
it all over themselves to cool down .
elephants love to take baths .
they are good .
they are good swimmers .
and they like to splash around in the water .
because they drink so much and enjoy swimming so much elephants needta live near a lot of water .
elephants are often bothered by flies and other insects .
they get rid of them by taking mud baths .
this group of african elephants looks red because they have been rolling around in red mud .
elephants live and travel in groups called herds .
a herd may be a few animals .
like three or four .
or a few hundred .
so of course you are going to do that .
right ?
come on chi you're getting silly now .
okay ?
listen .
would you listen to the story .
most of the time elephants are peaceful animals .
they usually charge only if they are threatened .
do you know what that means ?
what ?
they usually charge only if they are threatened .
that means that .
if you come up to them and you scare them .
then they'll charge you .
but otherwise if you don't scare them they probably will not .
bull elephants get very excitable and angry .
what does charge mean ?
charge ?
okay it's what nicky does to you when you're playing .
he he just .
charge !
and runs into you .
he stands across the room and then you run over to him and then you crash into him ?
that's a charge .
bull elephants get very excitable and angry for a few weeks or months about once a year .
this is called being in a a musth ?
a musth .
zoo elephants must be kept by themselves during musth musth .
they're hugging ?
elephants are very smart animals .
they're even there are even schools for .
this ?
that's the same as that .
very good .
excellent .
they're very smart animals .
there are even schools for asian elephants .
do you know elephants .
have schools ?
yes .
you do now .
but where's the school ?
well let me read it and we'll find out .
they were they are taught to drag piles of heavy logs and load them onto trucks .
elephants also carry people .
like these men with their bundles of grass .
so they take a bunch of elephants and they bring them to elephant school .
and they teach them .
to drag piles of heavy logs .
you know when .
trees are cut down ?
and they're they're very heavy logs and they teach the elephants to drag them .
and then to load them with their trunks .
they pick them up .
and they put them on the truck !
and then they teach them to carry people .
and their bundles of grass .
and that's what they learn at elephant school .
do you think do you think they'll learn how to add ?
and count and read ?
no !
no .
they do elephant things .
these asian elephants are being rounded up to be trained for work .
african elephants are not as easy to train .
you are grounded .
what ?
they're grounded .
no .
these asian elephants are being rounded up to be trained for work .
in other words they go out and they find them all over the place .
one here and one there and one there .
and they round them up .
that means they get them all together .
in in one group .
and these are rounded up elephants because they're all together .
african elephants are not as easy to train .
they don't learn as fast .
often they are killed for their ivory tusks .
because they like the .
they were sticking into the ground ?
and they people take that from them .
even though it is against the law .
elephants deserve better treatment than this .
the end .
alright .
in the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf .

more than a year longer than a .
human baby needs to grow inside its !
mother .

often has no tusks at all .
this is an african elephant .
male elephants are called bulls .
african elephants have a dip in their backs .
see that ?

the elephant's nearest living relative is a small furry creature called a .
hyrax .
these hyraxes live in rocky holes in africa .
another close relative of the elephant is the sea cow .
this sea cow is called a manatee .

as much as two hundred and fifty pounds a day .
they use their trunks to reach high branches .
tear up plants .
and strip the bark off trees .
they use their tusks to dig for salt .
they also dig holes in dry river beds to find water .
then other thirsty animals come and drink the water too .
elephants drink an amazing amount of water .
about fifty gallons a day .
they suck up quarts of water into their trunks at a time then squirt the water down their throats .
they also bathe by squirting the water from their trunks all over their bodies .

they are good swimmers and they like to splash around in the water because they drink so much and enjoy swimming so much .
elephants needta live near a lot of water .

like these men with their bundles of grass .
these .
asian elephants are being rounded up to be trained for work .

it's kind of boring said baby bear .
should we have a picnic ?
what a good idea !
said the owl .
we'd better go said baby bear .
my bath must be ready by now .
off they went .
down and down .
the owl got .
out and flew away .
goodbye he said .
it was nice to meet you .
it rained and the rain dripped through baby bear's helmet .
home went baby bear .
back down the chimney and onto the living room carpet with a bump !
mrs bear came into the room .
how did you get so dirty she grasped .
as she took him .
to the bathroom .
you look like you've been up the chimney .
i have !
said baby bear .
first i found a rocket .
then i put on my space helmet .
and then i flew to the moon .
my said mrs bear laughing .
what will you think of next !
the end .
he's already for bed .
the elephant book .
animals in the wild elephant .
and then it's time to go play with the toys ?
can't you make them play with you ?
elephants are the largest land animals .
this baby looks tiny beside its mother .
but when it was born it weighed two hundred pounds and was about three feet tall .
it grew inside its mother for over one year and ten months .
more than a year longer than a human baby needs to grow inside its mother .
a baby elephant is called a calf .
a mother elephant usually gives birth to one calf at a time .
she will not give birth again until her calf is about three years old .
a baby elephant may drink its mother's milk until it's until it is four or five years old .
it curls back its trunk while feeding .
you see them touching .
there are two kinds of elephants .
asian and african .
that's how they wa drink water .
yep .
this is a female asian elephant .
asian elephants are not as tall as their african cousins .
they also have smaller ears and tusks .
the female .
called a cow .
often has no tusks at all .
see the difference ?
but the little elephant's little .
but the all all the elephants are big .
you're right .
and he wants to be big like you like the other elephants .
like i'm big and you're little .
he will grow .
this is an african elephant .
male elephants are called bulls .
african .
elephants have a dip in their backs .
they also have ridges on their trunks .
which end in two points .
asian elephants have smoother trunks that end in just one point .
look at this .
the elephant's nearest living relative is a small furry creature called a .
hyrax .
hyrax ?
these hyraxes live in rocky holes in africa .
they don't look much like elephants but their feet are like elephants's feet .
only much smaller !
another close relative of the elephant is the sea cow .
this sea cow is called a .
man manatee ?
manatee .
i had never heard of it until i read the book .
me either this is .
i know .
this is new .
sea cows are shy creatures that never leave the water .
their skin and teeth are like an elephants's .
some sea cows even have small tusks .
wouldn't want to ride an elephant ?
no .
why ?
because they knock you off .
you gotta hold on .
asian elephants .
what am i going to hold on to ?
i can't hold on to their ears .
asian .
no way i'm not going on no elephant .
okay .
asian elephants often live in forests and swamps .
this asian cow elephant lives in .
a small country north of india .
you can see her small ears and her very small tusk .
african elephants live in the plains as well as forests .
this african elephant lives in the open grassland .
it flaps its huge ears to help keep cool in the hot african sunshine .
elephants do not eat meat .
they eat grass leaves fruit and bark .
as much as two hundred and fifty pounds a day .
they use their trunks to reach high branches .
tear up plants .
and strip the bark off trees .
they use their tusks to dig for salt .
they also dig holes in dry river beds to find water .
what if he finds a snake ?
i don't know .
i don't know maybe he'll step on it .
they also i read that .
then other thirsty animals come and drink the water too .
see him looking look for water ?
got a lot bigger and bigger and bigger .
elephants drink an amazing amount of water .
about fifty gallons a day .
that's a lot of water .
they suck up quarts of water into their trunks at a time then squirt the water down their throats .
they also bathe by squirting the water from their trunks all over their bodies .
elephants love to take baths .
they are good swimmers .
wait a minute .
and they like to splash around in the water .
one minute .
come on .
they are good swimmers and they like to splash around in the water .
because they drink so much and enjoy swimming so much .
elephants needta live near a lot of water .
he's going to to take a bath .
elephants are often bothered by flies and other insects .
they get rid of them by taking mud baths .
this group of african elephants looks red because they have been rolling in red mud .
elephants live and travel in groups called herds .
a herd may be a few .
animals or a few hundred .
most of the time elephants are peaceful animals .
they usually charge only if they are threatened .
bull elephants get very excite excitable and angry for a few weeks or months about once a year .
this is called being in mu musth .
is that in love ?
i've never heard of that one either this book has some things i've never heard of .
zoo elephants must be kept by themselves during musth .
look at this .
what happened ?
what is it doing ?
looks like they're kissing .
weird ?
elephants are very smart animals .
there are even schools for asian elephants .
they are taught to drag piles of heavy logs and load them onto trunks .
elephants also carry people .
like these men with their bundles of grass .
these asian elephants are being rounded up to be trained for work .
african elephants are not as easy to train .
often they are killed for their ivory tusks .
even though this is against the law .
elephants deserve better treatment than this .

i don't know .
that's kind of what i thought might happen .
touch that .
that's not a magnet on it .
that's neat .
let's try that again .
it just popped out of my hand !
cool .
these are totally cool .
they move !
this one's .
pulling .
pulling .
pulling .
these ones .
you want to try ?

that's cool it just .
jumps right out of your hand doesn't it ?

now we can connect them together .
cool .
let's let's .
i know what we can do .
can i try one of those ?
that is cool .
did it pop out of your hand ?
that's really strong .
you know what ?
see if i hold it upside down whether it'll go up .
it really jumps straight up in the air then .
can i try that this time ?
that was cool .
let's try to make it .
here can i try something ?
let me connect them and see if they can go in a line .
are those too heavy ?
did they fall off because it was heavy ?
let's .
make it too heavy for them .
then it'll break up .
let's try that again .
okay .
if you .
watch this .
it popped out of my hand .
can i try one of that ?
i want to try them .
that's neat .
so if you drop them all at once they're all going to stick on there .
they don't even roll off or anything .
do you know why they all stick together ?
no .
and then this .
that's why it moved .
i like that one it makes a line .
it's neat .
here feel this chi .
here put those balls over there .
now .
hold the magnet .
like that .
right above it ?
put the magnet .
in mommy's hand .
and .
can you feel the pressure ?
and you can feel .
hold it tight .
now see it pushes it away .
pushes the magnet away .
can you feel that ?
and pops out of my hand .
can you feel like .
feel that red one .
it doesn't want to go down there on those balls .
but what happens if you turn it over ?
turn the magnet over ?
it goes straight down .
so try one side of the magnet .
does it .
go down ?
or does it push away ?
straight down .
and if you turn them ?
over .
away .
that goes down .
now flip it over and hold on tight .
and can you feel that pressure pushing away from the from the ball ?
no .
now turn it over .
will it go down if you turn it over ?
now turn the magnet over .
see each side of the magnet does something different .
i got you !
i hooked you .

so that must mean that this magnet is stronger !
then the ones in here .
because it pushed them away .

when we were driving over you know that bridge that comes up when you come over from chelsea .

and it was kind of hot because the sun was out .
and we didn't want to be late so we got we got over by the sidewalk and we're driving .
and all of and .
we're keeping to the right and all of the sudden this car comes flying out in front of us .
i hadta put on my breaks inv screamed .

that's scary .
and he ate my mother's head off .
and the only thing she had is her foot .
and her leg and her arms and her stomach .
and everything except for h except for her h head .
the lion ate her head off .
that sounds really scary .
to here .
you must have been happy when you woke up .
when you knew it was just a dream .
i was going to cry .
that is really scary .
thank you for telling me that story .

to drive like that .
i know at least i didn't get into an accident .
can you tell me something scary that happened to you ?
no mommy tell you .

i know .
when you went to the dentist ?
he got very scared .
he had a bad experience .
ew i hate this color .
when we went to the dentist .
when he was younger he went to another dentist .
well the new dentist hadta .
he cracked his tooth he hadta fill it but .
the first dentist he went to .
did some work because he didn't have enough enamel on the front teeth .
he didn't use any novocaine or xylocaine .
i didn't use no xylocaine nu nine .
and what he did was he drilled the back of his front teeth .
what he really did was he gave him two juvenile root canals .
and .
didn't really explain the dynamics of it to me .
just said he was going to fill the teeth with anti sensitivity medicine .
but really what they were was juvenile root canals and he didn't use anything .
yikes .
so it was a very traumatic experience for him so our new dentist has been very tolerant trying to be very patient with him .
are your teeth finally better now ?
chi ?
well he just went no cavities right ?
alright !
you know you were telling me to get off the highway .
and there's i was looking for vernon street around that big busy highway .
and there were all kinds of signs we were trying to read .
to kind of make sure we get off the right way .
so i was driving .
and all of the sudden ex2 said inv there's vernon street you have to get over in that lane .
and i didn't want to miss it because i didn't want to get here late .
so i i turned the car to go off the exit and this big truck was coming really fast .
no ?
and michelle said look out !
there's a truck !
and it missed us by this much .
it was really scary .

the bone out of the grocery bag .

and off they went to the palace and cinderella was left behind .
cinderella ran into the garden .
the mice ran after her .
how i wished to go to the ball said cinderella .
there was no use .

said a voice .
cinderella looked up .
there was a little woman with a wand .

she said .
i am here to give you your wish .
now let me see .
said the fairy godmother .
i need a pumpkin and a horse and a dog .

when the mice heard this they began to run .
but the fairy godmother stopped them with her wand .
a coach .
the horse turned into a coachman .
the dog turned into a footman .
and the mice turned into white horses .

at the ball the king was complaining .
the prince has met all the girls in the kingdom he said and he has not found one he likes .
give him time said the grand duke .
he has had enough time cried the king .
just then cinderella came into the ballroom .
when the prince saw her he bowed ?
may i have this dance he said .
yes .
said cinderella .
all night the prince danced only with cinderella .
they danced around the floor as if in a dream .
everyone said how lovely she is who can she be ?
the hours went by quickly suddenly the clock began to strike midnight .
cinderella ran down the palace steps as she ran she lost a glass slipper .
when the prince reached the steps cinderella was gone .
she he picked up the tiny glass slipper .
the girl who wore this slipper is the prince the girl i want to marry said the prince .
he told the grand duke to find her .
even before cinderella was home the magic ended .
the coach turned back into a pumpkin .
the coachmen turned back into a horse .
the footman turned back into a dog and there was cinderella and the mice just like before .
the next day the grand duke took the glass slipper to every house in the kingdom .
at last he came to the house where cinderella lived .
cinderell cinderella was in her room .
first drusilla tried a slipper .
her foot was much too long .
then anastasia tried the slipper her foot was much too wide .
are there any other girls in this house asked the grand duke .
no said the stepmother .
just then cinderella came downstairs .
who is this asked the grand duke .
i don't care she must try the slipper .
it fit perfectly .
so cinderella reached in her pocket and pulled out the other glass slipper .
the grand duke bowed to cinderella .
you are the girl .
the prince said he must marry .
said the grand duke .
so cinderella went to the palace and married the prince and they lived happily ever after .

in the hole ?
he found a space helmet on the drainboard in the kitchen and a pair of space boots .
nuhhuh that's not see .
on the mat by the front door .
that's not a space hat .
he's pretending .
he packed his teddy bear and found some food for the journey and took off up the chimney .
out into the night .
an owl flew past .
what a great rocket he said .
where are you going ?
to the moon said baby bear would you like to come too ?
yes please said the owl .
an airplane roared out of the clouds .
baby bear waved and some of the passengers waved back .
up and on they flew .
up and up above the clouds past millions of stars until at last they landed on the moon .
there's nobody here said baby bear .
there are no trees said the owl .
it's kind of boring said baby bear .
should we have a picnic ?
what a good idea said the owl .
we had better go said baby bear .
my bath must be ready by now .
off they went .
down and down .
the owl got out and flew away .
goodbye he said it was nice to meet you .
it rained and the rain dripped through baby bear's helmet .
home he home went baby bear back down the chimney and onto the living room carpet with a bump !
mrs bear came into the room .
how did you get so dirty she gasped as she looked took him to the bathroom .
you look like you've been up the chimney .
i have said baby bear .
first i found a rocket .
then i put on my space helmet .
and then i flew to the moon .
my said mrs bear laughing what will you think of next ?
the end .
bye bye .
bye .
bye bye teddy bear .

okay .
i don't know that one .
i don't know that one .
mr rush ?
mr rush was the fastest thing on two feet .
he used to rush here and there and there and here and back again all the time and of course he was always in such a rush that he never ever finished anything properly .
one morning he woke up with a start .
he had only had time for three hours sleep because he had been rushing about for so long the day before .
dear he cried leaping out of bed .
i'm late !
and he rushed into his bathroom and washed up not very well as he was in such a hurry and brushed one tooth and rushed downstairs three at a time .
he had a boiled egg and toast and a cup of tea for breakfast .
he boiled the egg for five seconds and it tasted awful .
he toasted the bread for only one second so it wasn't brown at all .
and so he couldn't bear to wait for the kettle to boil he made his tea with cold water .
what a horrible breakfast and of course he was in such a hurry a rush he only ate half of it .
rush .
silly fellow .
after his half of breakfast he rushed off again .
out of his front door leaving it open down his garden path .
out of his garden gate .
leaving it open too .
and off down the lane .
apple tree .
it is .
he passed mr happy .
good morning mr rush called mr happy .
where are you off to ?
can't stop cried mr rush i'm in too much of a hurry .
i can see that thought mr happy to himself as he watched mr rush disappear into the distance .
i wonder where he's going .
where mr rush was going .
was nowhere fast as usual .
he rushed around all morning and then rushed home and had a quick bite to eat .
a sandwich without bread and then rushed off again and then rushed around all afternoon .
that evening he was reading a magazine he never had time to read a book when he saw an advertisement for a vacation .
he said i'd like that .
i haven't had a vacation for ages .
but then he frowned .
i can't go on a vacation he thought because i don't have any money .
and then he thought again .
and he smiled .
i know he thought .
i'll get a job .
and so the following morning he rushed off and got a job with a farmer milking cows .
but of course he wasn't any good at that because if there's one thing a cow can't stand it's being rushed especially when it's being milked .
so mr rush rushed off and got himself another job driving a bus but of course he wasn't any good at that .
he was always in such a rush that he never stopped at any of the bus stops .
and if there's one thing people waiting at a bus stop don't like is when the bus doesn't stop for them .
so mr rush rushed off and got himself another job as a waiter .
but of course he wasn't any good at that either .
no sooner had he served people a meal and they had taken one bite then he'd whisk the plate away from under his noses .
their noses and if there's one thing hungry people can't stand it's having food whisked away from them .
poor mr rush no job no money .
dear he sighed to himself .
i'm never going to be able to go on vacation .
he looked very gloom and gloomy .
but he is going to go on a vacation .
he is ?
okay but .
to the beach .
but then an idea came to him .
an idea for a job for someone who rushes around all the time .
an ideal job for someone who was the fastest thing on two feet .
do you know what that job was ?
would you like to know what that job was ?
a postman delivering express letters .
mr rush was so good at it he delivered twice as many letters in half the time any postman had ever done it before .
soon he had saved enough money for that vacation of his .
and so the very next week there was mr rush on vacation sitting on a beach in the hot sun under a palm tree .
this is the life he grinned and rushed off for a swim .
his fifteenth that day and then it was breakfast time .
the end .
the end .
i know where mr rush is in picture in book .
you do ?
he's here .
that's him .
okay .
the very hungry caterpillar .

they cut the salami and it it fell down there .
and it got cut .

the next day was sunday .
again and the caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf and after that he felt much better .
now he wasn't hungry anymore .
and he .
wasn't a little caterpillar anymore .
he was a big fat caterpillar .
he built a small house called a cocoon around himself .
he stayed inside for more than two weeks .
wait !
talk !
then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon and pushed his way out .
and then .
he turned into a butterfly !
he was a beautiful butterfly .
okay .
the end .

the birds tried to escape but foxy loxy threw the chicken little into the truck and locked the door .
before driving off the fox couldn't resist reading the recipes he had selected for each of his captures .

with a triumphant triumphant laugh he hurled the acorn sky ward jumped into the truck and cried on to the kitchen !

besides heat isn't everything mark .
did you know that ?
i'm not going to have any breakfast .
you're not ?
like you said the other day .
you're going to make us starve .
i was just teasing you ross .
i sure wish you weren't .
why don't you want to eat breakfast ?
i hate the smell .
the smell is bad but the taste is good .
ross is a very hungry boy .
he was afraid i was going to starve him .
no .
i thought the food was going to be something i didn't like .
it was something he did like .
actually .
his reaction was .
it was french toast .
the four forgetful bears .
you were forgetting .
we're going to go to sleep .
that light is going to be left on .
is it time to wake up ?
and what else did you say ?
and what did you say to that ross ?

i don't know .
can i have some water ?
you're big .
you can get your own water .
ross .
did you forget to do something ?
what ?
what do you think ?

daddy i had a dream about me and marky .
and there were lots of coke can .
and if we would open them we would find easter bunny eggs .
marky wanted a pink one .
i gave him the other pink one and i got that pink one .
that's all .
that was the end of the dream ?
nice dream .
but short .
short .
here's the forest .
no .
in this area is the forest .
my little darlings do the slosh .
we can eat any more food .
daddy .
i want to tell you something .
just a minute ross .
yes i do .
i need the wand .
i needta change to another channel .
what i had in mind was that we would move all these shelves over there .
you have too many soft animals in the bed .
you're only supposed to have seven .
i don't remember saying that .
you did ross .
take away marky's kittie .
take away his kittie .
daddy .
we need our story .
we've been waiting and waiting and and waiting .
here's your shoe .
only one shoe ?
i don't have one foot .
you're crazy .
you better not climb on that .
cause if you do you know you'll crack you head .
it'll come falling over and it'll crack your head .
you won't ever do it .
will you ross ?
no .
you know what dad .
i think it was a good idea to put it there .
because it's not next to anything and i won't want to climb on it .
there's nothing i want to climb up to get .
you know what ?
if i were a baby .
you know what i would do ?
i won't climb on anything dangerous .
what if you were a big boy ?
still .
the same thing .
i'd keep away from it .
ross .
isn't that right ?
what would you do if you were a baby and there was something dangerous ?
no .
if i were near something .
what would you do ?
i would not touch and not even climb on it .
why ?
because it might hurt me .
smart .
smart .
what if you're a big boy ?
still .
the same thing .
right .
good .
dad .
i have my fast running shoes on and they are baseball shoes .
is it too cold out here ross ?
no .
you could get a sweater if it is .
or something .
sweater ?
okay .
brainny wasn't very smart .
if he were smart he would keep his mouth shut .
he's not very smart .
he is .
or why would they call him brainny ?
do you remember that whole story about whether you wanted whether i could go to work ?
go ahead .
tell the tape recorder .
i said that if daddy didn't go to work then we could find play .
how would that work ?
you won't go you won't go to work .
but first you said ".
daddy is your school open ?
said .
and then you said you asked me again and i said ".
no .
but i could go .
and you said ".
well .
that's be good .
we could go down there and play on and make a bed .
a car out of of your chair .
and why would that be good ?
then i could play night rider .
and then how would you get a toy that way ?
i wouldn't have to get a toy .
you wouldn't have to get a toy that way .
and what if you couldn't go to my office ?
then what would you do ?
toy .
i see .
so .
which one did you want to have happen ?
not go .
right .
maybe i want go and toy .
how would that work ?
maybe we could buy the toy maybe we could go first and then buy the toy .
or buy the toy and then go .
or maybe because you were real good down there at the work i !
would give you a toy .
is that another idea ?
i think i'll be really full with this .
is that bottle empty ?
no .

and why why is why does that mean that he's a boy ?
get me a hand .
because the boy one has the crystal .

because the boy one has the crystal in the movie .
that means that he must be the boy one .
because he has the crystal in his back .
i'm going to put it in my pac man pouch .
not the one with hearts .
the other one .
with the heart .
the one this one .
right ?

great .
okay .
so now should i just put it down right here ?
are you guys ready to come out of bed now ?
no .
you just going to play in bed some more ?
fighting between harmful bacteria and my blood cells but the only fight where you get a cut and if you get a cut .
they're really doing that .
what are they doing .
they're going .
no they're dying .
i hope they're dying because if .
they don't if the white blood cells do not stop the harmful bacteria .
the harmful bacteria will kill the body .
yes .
you will get infection and eventually you will die .
really .
so it's that that's why we count on those white blood cells .
don't we ?
that's why we can we can count on them mark don't worry .
i know .
that's why they're there .
plus the band aid .
do you feel better now that you know you have white .
plus the band aid .
plus the band aid .
but who's really important ?
the band aid or the white .
no .
the cells .
they risk their lives .
but .
they risk their lives .
and they even if and even if .
they're like vampires .
they've got teeth .
and even and if and the white guys even risk their lives even if they think they might !
die .
you know what they do ?
you know what the .
what ?
you want to hear what the white guys do ?
what ?
what ?
they eat !
up the bacteria .
yick .
they get they gobble them like this .
they this is what a cell looks like .
have you do you see any pictures of what cells look like ?
they're like little round things .
and they open and then they gobble they they .
cells can change their shape .
and you're a pretend you're a little bacteria .
then i'll just go like this .
now you gobble you up .
okay ?
like they have no defense .
the bacteria have no defense against the white blood cells .
they just go .
and so then the harmful bacteria are finished .
do you want me to read the whole story ?
but once but they don't go .
they don't suck them .
do you want to hear now the story .
they eat them all up .
who wants to hear the story ?
okay .
you have to stop talking okay ?
you want to hear the story ?
i want to hear the story .

do you really need a bath ?
at least i want to take a bath because then i can play with the pac man .
and i have no idea why he meant at least , it wasn't appropriate at all .
ross .
why did you say ".
at least i can take a bath then ?
at least i want to .
you mean .
in any case i want to ?
okay .
and besides i want to .

yes .
they are to share mark .
but those are yours .
do you have to go pee ?
i'm not your friend .
go ahead .
tomorrow you'll get over it .
that was a silly thing for him to say .
wasn't it ross ?
maybe it has something to do with lieing down .
how do you think that would have happened .
ross ?
maybe he doesn't get enough sleep .
i'm sure he doesn't get enough sleep .
cause he goes to bed really late .
you know .
he's a little boy who doesn't get enough sleep .
that's his problem .
i think maybe .
look .
again .
knock knock .
knock knock .
marky finished his snack .
wait .
i want to do everything the right way .
right .
that's a good idea ross .
upstairs now .
are you finished ?
i want to take my key car up there .
yes .
certainly .
ross is being a good boy .
i want everything like that .
do you want to do everything the right way too ?
more orange .

first there was an apple tree .
then two apples fell and then all six fell on the ground .
he had some paint and some paint brushes .
point to that .
okay .
and then what happened ?
he took out a brush and put in some paint and made a picture and then he went and showed it to everybody .
very good .
okay ?
yes .
really nice .
was a tree and some .
no .
first there was a building .
then somebody knocked .
no .
first there was just a tree on the block .
then somebody was making one .
then there was .
then a person a person was making a building next to it and then there was a building next to the tree .
how did the building get there ?
this guy made it .
you mean the guy with the steam shovel ?
good .
very good .
that's a steam shovel .
now let us go on to the next page .
what is wrong ?
there are too many of tooth brushed and too little tooth paste tubes .
okay .
did that work out that time ?
look down below in the the wet vehicles drawer .
daddy .
i put it in this drawer .
and then it dropped down .
what was the other one you told marky ?
that other one was .
how do you keep a skunk from smelling ?
and marky said .
because he doesn't have a nose .
no .
hold it's nose .
cute .
and ross corrected marky when he said ".
because he doesn't have a nose .
he said ".
you don't say because .
don't say butt head .
well you said butt head to me really screamy .
how are you going ?
we need you daddy .
without you we make a mess .
we don't put them in piles .
well hurry up .
well we're doing the best we can .
jeez .
dad did you ever do a burglary .
no .
the reason why i ask is that they had a story that there was a boy who held on the steps .
no no he was sitting on the steps when the bad his rubble duckie because he was mad at his mother .
and then he got a little older .
he ran away from home three times .
then he got older and stayed out in the street all night .
and then he gotta be a man .
and he did a robbery .
and went to jail .
and where did you hear about this ?
on tv .
it was an add .
they were telling us .
telling you not to do that right ?
yes .
that's very interesting .
i want the one which skelator is fighting with heman and appears teala .
ross should i straighten these up put all the et cards together ?
no .
we have to have a little bit of mess don't we ?
is that right ?
what's the idea does everybody have to have a little bit of mess .
a little bit .
what were you going to say .
and stay out .
ross are you sure you're not missing some programs tonight ?
no .
there was good stuff on at eight o'clock .
you should have been here at eight o'clock .
what was good then ross ?
right .
right .
i know .
i'm going to put some ideas down on the tape recorder so i can remember them .
what ideas have you got ?
i see on the fireplace screen .
do you think that would really work ?
i see .
right .
right .
that's what i was thinking .
right .
and then what else happened .
daddy .
i'm sorry .
so that's over ?
so you can't watch nickelodeon now can you ?
that's over now .
we could look in the programs and see if there is anything else good .
we could just talk you and i .
i'd like to talk to you .
would you like to tell me about what do you think of ann more ?
what are your ideas i know you don't want to kiss her but what do you think of her otherwise ?
well that's nice .

would you like to be her boy ?
no !
you don't want to trade ?
hmhunh .
how come ?
you don't really want to trade or a long time ?
no .
why not ?
it's scary .
scary to go to another persons house ?
and they might not have not not even have our heeman our toys our heeman our heeman toys .
well when you went to hungry you didn't take all your toys with you .
well we took our star wars ones .
we hadta lock stuff here all your bikes and everything we left here .
that's because we couldn't take our bikes .
was it too scary to go to hungry ?
no .
i see .

if i did that what am i going to do ?
if i give all that stuff to you then i'm going to be in real trouble .
i'll i'll get the stuff that you need out .
doesn't sound like a very good idea .
it doesn't sound like a good idea ross .
i'm not mark !
i said ross .
did you think i said ross mark ?
i thought so .
it was kind of silent i didn't say it very clearly .
you're right .
maybe you say it that you thought you know .
no .
maybe you heard it maybe i said .
it's on the tape recorder should we go back and listen ?
do you want to go back and listen and see if we can find the truth ?
very interesting maybe your were right and i was wrong .
who do you think is really right .
let's go listen .
we went back and listened to the tape recorder and we couldn't hear the difference it was sort of mushy .
so i think i understand how ross thought it might have be mark .
it went like that that's why i thought it was mark .
right .
right .

mark's going to tell the taperecorder a story .
go ahead „ mark .
once upon a time there was a little baby .
he was called mark .
and one time he played with his friend .
and we said ".
friendie can i go upstairs ?
and the friendie said ".
after my tv .
and the mark baby marky said ".
why don't you go ?
and he says ".
because i have to do more work .
and he said and he says ".
what work ?
and the boy says ".
my homework .
and he s and the baby says ".
what is homework ?
and he says ".
no it's leftovers from your school .
so leftovers are left up left up sh clothes ?
no they're left up papers .
worky papers .
a and the baby said ".
and then the boy said ".
i have to get to my work so go and eat your jelly .
and then the baby said ".
okay .
they run around and then he almost ran into the wall but he stopped and walked over back to jelly .
and he said and he said ".
well i think this is naptime so i'll hurry up and eat my jelly .
and that was the big swallow .
well i'm able ?
go to bed .
wake up .
i ?
says ".
and then he said * m 3s ".
who is that who is that ?
a monster who came in to scare every people ?
he won't scare me .
i am mister t .
they said ".
no i'm your father .
and he says ".
well i never knew you were „ .
and the and then they lived happily ever after .
where's off button ?
you shouldn't stop it „ mark .
well how do you stop it ?
what button ?
a button where ?
sure .
alright .
few days back mark and i went for the bus and mark said as because i was dashing for the bus in the car , he said ".
i wish that some people didn't have to sit in the car and listen to other people get mad at the bus .
i wasn't even cursing the bus at that point but it's typical that i get down to the end of the street and the bus is already past and hasn't bothered to stop or anything and i curse out the bus .
and so mark has been trying to get me to stop saying anything about the bus even when we miss it by a by a hair .
we were ross was talking about ".
dad you know that you're going to be here on the first day of spring and mom's not going to mom's going to be in california ?
and i said ".
ross you i know .
i looked at the calendar .
that's right .
and he said ".
but dad you know you have to admit that mommy makes better valentine's day cakes .
but we'll save some for you .
this hasta do with the fact .
what was interesting was sort of the leap that he made w which was connecting the fact that i'm !
going to be back for the first day of spring and that .
will you miss your mom ?
he said ".
sure we will .
and he said ".
but dad you know you have to admit that mommy makes better valentine's cakes valentine's day cakes .
but we'll save some for you when you get back .
and what he's saying is .
not valentine's day .
saint patrick's day cakes .
i'm sorry .
saint patrick's day cakes .
and .
he never mentioned saint patricks before then ?
no we had .
we had talked before about the fact that i would be g missing saint patrick's day when i'm in paris .
going to paris and rome and i'd be missing saint patrick's day .
but i guess he figured out that he would save some things .
and so what he's saying is ".
it's okay that we have mother for saint patrick's day and you for the first day of spring because after all mommy makes better saint patrick's day cakes than you would .
so that's appropriate that she should be there for saint patrick's day .
and don't worry „ dad .
we'll save you some .
so it'll all be okay .
he's getting it all ready in his mind , how it's going to be for various holidays and things when people are going to be going on trips .
ross was climb ross climbed over the banister .
and as he did i noticed that the banister cut him right between the legs .
and i gave him this rather startled look or concerned look and i said ".
oo right on the pi privates .
and by this time he was standing up and he s looks me straight in the eye for a moment like he was trying to absorb what i said .
and then his face broke into a smile and he said ".

you were down like that .
you have to be up the lip right there .
see ?
right there .
now why don't you stop taking it off ?
wouldn't that be a better idea ?
it just came off .
well be .
because you're bumping it .
that's why it came comes off .
it's being bumped back and forth .
sure if someone's bumping it .
that's how these things happen .
i know about little boys and the bumping you do .
i've seen little boys bump around .
when i was a little boy i used to do some bumping too .
now a days i don't i try not to bump as much as i used to .
i'll tell you what's wrong with this one .
what ?
it's a little bit twisted from what you just did .
it's just not supposed to move around as much as you've been moving it around ross alexander .
okay .
it's just not supposed to be bumped and bruised .
well how then how can i go ?
you're trying to release them ?
don't release those bat guys .
no .
i let go at .
i don't want to go .
just don't do it .
why not ?
okay okay i'm going to get ride of the mud flaps forever then .
no .
do you want to get rid of the mud flaps forever ?
if you .
that means we can't do it ever !
i'm will to get rid of them forever then .
well what if we went like that and did it ?
why are you trying to bump them ?
why are you trying to get rid of them and bump them ?
what if we want to want them to what if we want to play and their get shot .
at the mud flaps ?
and this gets shot and this gets shot ?
the mud flaps don't get shot .
the mud flaps never got shot off in the movie .
they just don't .
the mud flaps are part of the integral * = may be a blend of integral and intrinsic part of the system .
but we can't keep it on when we're when they shoot it .
then how are we going to be able to shoot it ?
look at you .
look at you .
you just munching it .
i saw you munch it .
it fell off .
no you munched it .
i saw what you did .
i saw you munch it .
i was putting the gun in .
i saw the munching .
the horrible munching .
actually it didn't even fall off .
it just got twisted .
it just got twisted wasn't isn't even broken .
it got twisted .
it twists a little bit .
it's only designed to go up and down .
it's not designed to go back and forth from side to side .
okay now there's munched again .
look at it .
what is maybe it needs snapped up there .
see what happened ?
it needed to be snapped up in that part .
now try it again .
now lay it down with its legs down and see if it folds .
okay that's all it's supposed to do .
just go like that .
and the more you do it the more you munch it .
and you gotta snap it back .
now that works .
don't munch anymore .
let em go .
miss cloud sleeper sleeps the clouds out of carolot .
me from his new allowance game .
i said ".
could anyone tell that this is ?
would anyone everyone think anyone think this is real money ?
and i said ".
maybe .
and he said ".
well but not good lookers .
and i said ".
not good lookers .
and and then he said ".
pe not people who looked really close and looked really good .
at the airport marky was helping us carry packages .
and he got really tired and he said ".
i rest my case .
what did he s ?
how did he s ?
mary's going to do it .
we said ru i said ".
run , mark , run .
and he said ".
i i'm good .
or ".
i don't want to be bad .
he said ".
i don't want to be bad .
and i said ".
well you can run .
go ahead and run .
you won't be bad .
i don't want to be bad .
i rest my case .
right and then we asked him what does it mean ?
rest his case .
it means .
dad .
what does it mean , ro marky ?
rest his case .
i don't remember .
when you rest your case means when you when you when you when you make a point .
right but marky didn't know that .
marky thought it meant that he was really tired and he was resting .
nuhhuh nuhhuh i that that was make sense .
what ?
that does make sense .
it does make sense .
it does , ross .
it says .
not by what the word means .
yeahhuh .
let mark say , ross .
it means i make i made my point .
who's talking ?
that makes sense .
no mark you didn't know that .
that was mark .
well that makes sense .
and that's that does make sense and that's but that's not what you said last night .
last night you said that rest your case meant that you were tired and you didn't want to you wanted to sleep .
no .
i wondered if he were saying it in the past tense .
i was showing mark a .
snoopy's cartoon .
one cartoon was snoopy blew gave woodstock , the bird , a little puff of air , a little blow so that he would float with his balloon .
and then snoopy lay down .
in the next cartoon sloopy snoopy was laying down on his doghouse and the bird came flying by with a gust of wind and knocked the dog onto the balloon .
and the bird stayed on the doghouse .
and i i showed that to mark and mark said ".
first he helped him .
then he terrorized him .
it's interesting to me because and changes midsentence .
first he helped him .
that was ".
first snoopy helped woodstock .
then .
let's see .
this is july twenty eighth ha having lunch and ro mark was trying to say how much carrots he wants to eat , trying to say that he only wants to eat as much as .
nuhhuh .
nuhhuh .
this is how low yours was .
it was this little ?
this little .
unhunh unhunh .
he's lying .
who's lying ?
marky said ".
daddy come up here !
i want to i want you to show me something .
and i said ".
mark you have to do it by yourself and just .
i said ".
just tell me .
and he said ".
no you have to come up here .
it's a showing you kind of thing .
they were from yesterday , the twenty seventh .
mark was playing with a hula hoop and he said ".
think of it as a giant frisbee .
pretend i'm a giant and it's a giant frisbee .
because i was fooling around with the car and he was just out there playing .
and i was eating some graham crackers .
and mark said ".
are you curious how it will taste with peanut butter on it ?
he had already tasted it with peanut butter and he knew it was very good , graham crackers with peanut butter .
and he said ".
are you curious how it will taste with peanut butter on it ?
wanting to know whether i i'd ever had it before , essentially .
mark walked in behind me and said ".
mom i'm hungry .
and i said ".
you are , ?
without looking at him .
and he said ".
and it's not ross who is working .
it's mark who is playing .
and i'm hungry .
he was identifying himself because he knew i didn't look up .
they have underwear on and he said ".
psyche .
means ".
i don't really mean it .
they they didn't really have underwear .
a little bit earlier today .
it's july thirtieth .
he said i said ".
don't run around naked .
similar situation , we were in the shower .
don't run around naked .
and he said ".
i don't .
ross said .
mary brought home some groceries and ross said ".
could you wash me a cherry ?
and mary reacted to it .
and i said ".
why ?
do you think that's funny ?
he said ".
i don't usually say it .
you could you wash your cherry for me ?
and i said ".
okay i agree .
so anyway incorrect use of the benefactive as a direct object , i guess .
the verb .
she was also calling the .
they were talking about things and she was saying ".
you know it really was interesting that mark said about rest my case , you know .
this was something that was recorded i believe on the last tape .
and she said ".
you know it was a perfect use of it rhetorically .
it's just the only place where the rhetorical use and the meaningful use that is of really resting something both could cooccur .
in other words , ro mark didn't could use it rhetorically correctly but didn't have to use it metaphorically .
that is , the idea of resting a case metaphorically was not something he wanted to buy into yet .
so he wanted to use it in a specifically undergeneralized way but still appropriate with the situation .
today is august first and name has come to visit .
said ".
dad i'm going to make a test and we'll see who goes past it first .

and another time he said ".
i'm a lamp !
and he said ".
no .
russell , you're russell .
and he said ".
how did you know that i was russell .
and he said ".
because a lamp doesn't talk .
that's true .
and it doesn't have legs .
what about little children that don't know how to speak yet .
are they lamps ?
how do you know that they're not lamps ?
because they don't have lights .
because they don't have lightbulbs in their mouths .
that is silly .
isn't it ?
because they don't have because they don't have mustache .
you don't have a mustache and you're still a person .
not all people have to have mustaches on their mouths .
and women aren't even supposed to have them .
they're not allowed to .
it's against the law .
yes .
only in pretend .
they can paint them on .
but then they have to wash them off after they go to the party .
right .
god won't let them have mustaches .

i i'm not sure this is how how br size baby brontosauruses are .
i know .
baby brontosaurus might be about this big .
that's not too big .
mom ?
unhunh .
mom .
mom the dinosaur quicksand i i mean the dinosaur quicksand you know was that mud that the dinosaurs shrink * sur down into .
that's what turned into clay n clay water .
it did ?
in the movie ?
no .
in reality ?
that that in real in the dinosaur ages there was there was there was these little there was these blob *fatmhm big blobs of mud that shrinks that is deep .
and even baby they these guys and and daddy these guys *fatmhm and mommy these guys , every animal could sink into that .
they sink into the mud .
and then what happens to the mud ?
we well went it went to these guys .
and what do we do with it ?
it it was water .
it became water .
no we use it for oil .
i mean .
oil .
oil .
oil for the car .
i mean like .
oil and gas .
well .
what do you mean like , mark ?
i mean like .
never mind .
mommy these guys and baby these guys refer to the dinosaurs by the way .
okay mark well .
it's .
what about the tar ?
did their animals did animals ever sink into tar ?
when was that and that was that in the old days ?
that's what i was talking about , the tar .
the tar !
that they sank into .
you mean when the dinosaurs sank into the tar ?
and then we it turned wa it turned like solid .
it turned solid in these days .
right .
in these days it's solid and you can't shrink * sur into it because it's solid .
we know that we know that .
it's you can't sink !
into it .
it's solid tar .
you can't sink into it .
like a street when they cover up the road with tar and it gets really hard ?
then it's solid tar „ right ?
these days it's not soft tar that the dinosaurs shrinked * sur * m=ed into .
but there is soft tar you can sink into still .
these days ?
sure you can still find places to sink in .
where ?
in trinidad .
trinidad ?
sure they have tar pits there .
they do ?
sure there are tar pits there .
could we ever go there ?
would you like to ?
yes we could go there and sink into the tar pits .
are you sure they're hiding ?
sure we could do it .
what ?
are they hiding ?
no no you just go there and sink right in and that's the end of you .
no .
who , the dinosaurs ?
who's hiding ?
are en are the pits hiding ?
no no the pits aren't hiding .
they're all around you ?
they're all around you .
like there's a skinny pot spot you can stand .
and then sometimes you'll slip off of the skinny part right into the tar pit .
why ?
is that sure ?
that's for sure .
no my my it should be like about this wide maybe .
it should so you don't really slip in ?
no you'll probably slip in .
no i mean like it can !
be this .
maybe we shouldn't go there .
maybe we just shouldn't go there .
no i mean .
you mean the car could sink too ?
everything sinks right into those tar pits .
is there is the road have tar pits ?
there's no road .
it's sunk in .
sunk in .
you understand ?
i wish i was a monkey .
and i could swing and i could swing across california and a across everywhere .
that would be a good idea .
why don't you do that next time you're born „ okay ?
next time you're born you gotta be a monkey „ okay ?
no next time i'm b i'm born i i'm i'm going to be a animal and i hope i'm going to be a monkey .
you're hoping .
why don't you do it for sure ?
no hoping .
just really do it .
just do it .
just do it .
okay ?
okay but .
you better let your mommy sleep now .
she's very tired .
okay .
here turn the taperecorder off now .
know what my dinosaurs turned into ?
what ?
bones .
they had bones in their bodies in the first place .
i know .
and then they !
turned into bones .
they died and they turned into bones .
and the bones and the bones sank because the bones were so heavy .
they were .
the bones were heavy .
but .
how come dogs can hold up bones ?
what ?
how come dogs can hold up bones ?
because they're not as big and heavy .
you mean the puppy is heavier than is stronger ?
doesn't have heavy bones .
bones ?
don't have heavy bones .
your doggie didn't have big bones .
the dinosaur had such big heavy bones that it was easier for him to stay inside of the water so that he didn't have to carry around all that weight .
those guys went in the water because they were so big and they had big heavy bones , heavier than that ?
mom .
how did y ?
how did what ?
how did how can you have a different kind of mo a different kind of chi child ?
how can you have that kind of child ?
that's when you have a baby that wasn't that didn't grow right .
like maybe the feet got je like twisted like twisted .
right .
you take a cute little boy like you .
no , brian .
and you tickle them too much and they turn into monsters .
no .
unhunh .
well how else are you going to do it ?
there's one more way .
what's that ?
how to make a monster .
how ?
you get a dinosaur and sh and thr .
you get married to a dinosaur .
and and th and then and then you then you then you tear the skin off .
and then you be the di dinosaur .
and then you'll be eaten * m .
what's the right way to say ?
eaten .
very good .
because if you do that mistake ?
*fatright the the meat eaters are going to get you .
the meat eaters are going to get you „ right ?
how would they know that you're alive that that thing is alive ?
because the skin is all all parachute down because it was too it would be too big .
the skin would be too big .
the skin would all parachute down on you because it would be too big ?
why wouldn't you have the bones there anymore ?
or i thought you said you'd take the skin off the bones .
you would take the skin off the guy .
and use it ?
but i don't think they would try and eat you .
because it would all it would all .
once you tape the tape it , it would all parachute on .
where would you tape it ?
where else ?
on the cut .
tape the cut back up .
and would you what would you do to the skin ?
you go into it .
it won't be t too sharp .
a and it will be really rough to get through to cut through and to tape .
because the skin the ups the top skin is going to be kind of bumpy .
bumpy .
like and made like kind of like rock .
really rough „ ?
really rough .
and once you get in you have to tape it .
and i don't think that would be comfy in there .
inside ?
so you're going to cut the skin off a dinosaur *maruhhuh and take it off and then c climb inside and sew it and tape it back up ?
except you have to take all the bones and blood and veins and heads *motuhhuh and eyeballs out .
right and then .
that's just it's disgusting .
and then the skin is going to parachute down on you .
once you get in and tape it up it's going to parachute down on you .
now what's going to parachute down on you ?
i think i shouldn't have asked .
no we've got it all figured out here .
is this to become a monster ?
is this how you get to be a monster ?
except i don't think it's going to be working .
why not ?
you would have to get a small one .
a small dinosaur ?
and that would be hard to do it because it cou would .
it would and you'd know which one it would be .
which one , baby ?
no the one with the rough rough bumpy things .
you mean like ?
stegosaurus .
or the one with the spiked tail .
that's stegosaurus .
rough and bumpy .
you might mean ankylosaurus .
or or maybe that other vicious one .
tyrannosaurus rex ?
no that that other vicious one .
you're joking .
do you mean the meat eater ?
are they vicious ?
yep they're vicious .
plant eaters are vicious because they hit you with their tail „ ?
like one of them has a br .
one of them are * m stupid .
have a stupid brain .
and there's one with a spiked tail and one with a bumpy thing like .
buzz the but there's little plates one of those little plates with those plates .
lots of details .
i'm sure you couldn't eat dinner on the plates .
i'm sure you couldn't eat dinner on the plates .
on which plates , mark ?
the plates of the dinosaur .
those plates .
what if you cut them off ?
then you could eat dinner on those plates .
very funny , dad .
you would have to you would have to try it once you would get .
i don't think you could be a monster that way either because they would kill you .
the one with the plates and the one with the spiked tail , most of the one * m0s with the spiked tail .
does baby have any of these things ?
he has .
he's a furry dinosaur .
baby is a furry dinosaur .
dinosaur with fur , you can pet him .
no scale ?
why can't marky take his glasses to preschool ?
i saw a little boy who had them there .
those aren't shoes .
those are boots .
boots don't run fast .
it's not shoes that run fast .
marky .
it's your feet .
it's true .
what's true ?
the feet make you go fast .
not the shoes .
mark ?
what makes you go fast .
your feet or your shoes ?
do you want to go to burger king or something ?
i think not .
dad .
could you help us ?
we're doing this jumping thing .
you won't get hurt .
will you ?
no !
it's just that we're doing something special .
you have to hold on that end .
and he'll jump in the net it's kind of like a net .
i think it's too dangerous .
ross .
and he'll jump in it .
while we're holding it .
it's too dangerous .
isn't it ?
no !
are you sure ?
hold it tight !
but if you let go .
it'll crack open .
i won't .
okay !
sit down .

ross .
i did help .
ross .
you can put those two paintbrushes in the middle of the paints .
i have to wash my hands .
i told ross to put on his smurf shoes .
i can't put them on without me having my pants on .
this is indiana jones and he looks like he swings so we made him swing .
i could tell them .
i could take my little key car .
you know .
the one that looks kind of like michael knight's car .
and i could tell them that you know that little hatch that kitt !
has up on top of his head .
i could tell them that it opens up on the top and michael could open it up and jump onto the bad guys and jump onto the landing gear of the helicopter .
and climb up into the door and punch one bad guy out and then the other .
anything to eat .
mark ?
what has a mouth and teeth and a foot and no eyes ?
but .
ross .
a comb doesn't have a foot .
but then what about that part down straight ?
that's the handle .
and it doesn't have a mouth .
but where would they put the teeth ?
tim gave is to us .
the big one .

no .
the big tim .
mommy opened the for me when you weren't here .

bad luck for you but it's okay !
you can play with some of my new toys .
well .
i'm not even .
well .
why should i ?
i might get hungry even when we're at there .
you wouldn't get hungry at the monroeville mall .
ross .
if you ate your food at home .
but why did i have to when i was hungry .
i don't understand .
ross .
but why do i have to eat when i'm not hungry ?
i said maybe if i am hungry .
maybe if you get hungry later then you would like to do this .
i see .
but you're not hungry now ?
no .
i understand .
well .
that's good .
are we going to the mall ?
yes .
i thought you said the computers .
well .
first we're going to the computer store .
and then after after that we'll go to the mall .
very tricky !
dad ?
yes ross .
if you don't like this idea .
you don't have to do it .
but when we get to the mall could we get check if they have new he people .
new he man people you mean ?
i'm sure they don't have them .
i checked already and they weren't there .
just so i can know ?

you're doing really well in art and his words and everything .
and his learning how to read .
and i know just the way to do it .
you play ends and blends that's that's how you figure out how to read .
it's a learning how to read game .
does mommy do a good job on it ?
maybe even some words that you .
and maybe there's some words that you know that mommy doesn't know .
maybe there's some words that mommy knows that i don't know .
i sure wish there weren't car accidents .
they're pretty terrible .
they are airplane accidents .
too .
they are even worse than car accidents .
the things that make make the plane fly the propellers they break .
and they get bashed and the plane gets caught on fire the plane catches on fire .
markie says ".

i said ".

no they weren't the same ones .
they weren't the sames ones .
ross .
did you know that ?
no .
daddy made a mistake .
the other ones are in the other drawer .
here's your hair .
you forgot to lock my door .
he was a big ape that was on top of a skyscraper and a world war two !
fighting plane came to hit him .
no .
no .
that's king kong .
ross .
i see .
i was thinking of king hong .
not kung fu .
i'm going to eat something for dinner to make myself real strong .
you know what i'm going to eat .
dad ?
i'm going to have for dinner something that makes my eyes real strong .
can i have cheerios and a glass of milk and a bowl and milk and a spoon ?
and that milk in and in there .
you have to eat your cereal before you get peanut butter .
i'm not your friend anymore .
well .
you'll get a spanking .
marky isn't going to be my friend friend anymore .
that's why you said spanking .
no !
who's going to get a spanking ?
no .
let's do a fight after we do all the jumpover han and bucky bucky bronco and that stuff .
well .

mark .
marky's not helping .
marky's not helping .
you can see that .
no .
marky said .
ross said that .
daddy .
don't spank me for this .
but me and marky put some books on our bed .
not like the other time .
but i remembered and i put some of them away .
but some are in a pile .
you didn't say you'd spank us for that .
did you ?
i'll just spank you a little bit .
right ?
right .
now would you put the rest of your toys away .
okay .
i know marky's not helping .
but you're the big boy .
do you think i could go outside and help ?
yes .
you can .
you can do a lot more .
you can put all your your action figures back .
put them away .
ross .
come on .
put them away .
no .
you don't mean that .
you don't mean .
well .
i really mean is that i hate him when he puts the gum in his mouth .
he helped yesterday .
you helped yesterday .
mark ?
he helped with one part .
how much help did you do ?
he only helped with one part .
the first time he helped was when helped me dig .
the second time he did he brought a plant up for me to dig .
really ?
he did help .
didn't he ?
okay !
fifty cents .
okay !
i'll get your piggybank !
because you were a good worker .
ross .
you boys keep your clothes straight .
and don't get them all over the house .
okay !
but why is your stuff all over the house .
what stuff .
what do you mean ?
why are these things all over the place ?
i don't understand what you mean .
the places to keep the things that we put away .
you mean .
why do we have shelves up ?
because that's where you put them when you're finished putting them away .
i don't understand your problem .
ross .
explain it to me better .
why do we have to put our toys away when we don't have to put the baked things away ?
i see .
would you like to put the baked things away .
too ?
i mean .
like .
that thing that you're next to that you're looking in right now .
that big box .
would you like to put that away ?
we can put that away if you like .
do you want to put that away ?
well how ?
you can't put everything away because then you wouldn't have anything to put it in .
do you understand ?
i think you've got the wrong idea .
ross .
do you see something like this ?
this is called a dresser .
you use it to put things inside it .
i'm just asking you why we can't keep on putting things away all day and even when we die .
i always dream about killing things .
what did you kill .
marky ?
no .
no .
i didn't kill anything .
i dreamed about mommy and me and and ross and we were running upstairs .
what happened ?
who was killing things ?
that killing guy was coming after us .
what was his name ?
i don't know .
dracula ?
no .
i don't know .
you don't remember his name ?
no .
see if you can remember his name .
okay !
let's give him the blowing gun the killing gun .
let's give him a hint .
what program was it on ?
it wasn't a program .
it was a dream .
it was a dream !

no .
it was a person from my dream ?
it was a person from a dream .

maybe i might .
because my tummy's too full .
here we go .
right ?
ross is listening to abbott and costello and he came and he said ".
i must be brave .
i must be strong .
and then some indians came and took something away from him and he said ".
and i must be nuts .
at first you won't think this is funny .
but at the end you think it it will be .
first .
the two cowboys found a man dead that and they told abbott that he killed that man but he said ".
no .
i shot over there !
he fell down here .
and then he said ".
so .
who cares .
no .
no .
but he's dead .
and then another cowboy said ".
so .
who cares .
so .
what did they do to him ?
nothing .
did they take him away .
they're not going to hurt him ?
good .
good .
abbott said he might still drink on the dead man .
and then the the sheriff said ".
why did you gun by him .
gun him down ?
and then he said ".
i think i just dropped a bottle on my head .
i don't understand .
do you understand ?
the other the next the second one that was funny .
there was abbott sitting in the park .
he said ".
i am * am .
they said ".
who cares .
and he said ".
i do .
when he shot the dead man ?
no .
he wished that everybody didn't think he did .
okay !
now you're missing good jokes .
no .
it was my idea .
not hers .
whose idea was it really ?
ross's .
think so ?
did you have anything to say ?
no .
why did you call ?
remember it was mom who called you .
not me .
please don't rip it .
i'm going to .
okay !
go ahead .
and do it to see if i care .
you asked me to do it .
next time somebody asks me to do it .
i'm i'm going to do it .
was it right was you did ?
how should i have known ?
what do yo mean .
how should you have known .
you should use your head and think if it was a good idea .
how did i know you were teasing .
brain .
but i didn't think you would do what you were teasing .
daddies always tease their boys .
dad .
would you like this in your room ?
sure .
at school or at home .
at school .
and you can tell people that your son gave it to you .
daddy .
tell them about this and tell them that i gave it to you .
too .
where do you want me to put these up .
on my door ?
right on your door .
okay !
i'll take them to work and tell them that my son made them them for me .
okay !
what are we going to do next ?
i don't know .
maybe some reading .
we haven't done reading for a long time .
let me think .
we could try to learn work on a book .
marky can be on both of our sides .
when one person jumps one and then he jumps the other then he can take those two .
now i go first .
because blacks go first .
okay !
i don't need this stuff .
put some of this over here .
what is that .
that's a little pelican ?
no .
a mina bird .
yes .
my turn now .
i'm going to go like this .
you can't jump me .
i can .
what ?
ready ?
i said .
they're mine .
those are rossy's .
you keep rossy's and you keep mine .
i've gotta jump you now .
very bad boy .
very sneaky .
no .
you can't do that .
ross .
why ?
after you jump .
you move .
and you have to jump again if you want want to move again .
you just jump over him .
and that's it .
that's all you can do .
you can't go any further .
why ?
because that's the way to play it .
you mean you can't get over here .
that's next turn .
you do that next turn .
but you won't have a next turn because i'm going to cheat and jump you .
i'm not going to cheat but i'm going to be sneaky .
watch this .
one jump .
two jumps see .
so ?
there's a sneaky way to get me .
where ?
i'm not going to tell you .
no .
you can't do that .
that's not a a possible move .
you can't move backwards until you're a queen .
a king !
a king .
they're queens now .
right .
okay .
go ahead .
i'm not going to give you any help .
they're kings and queens .
want me to give you a little help ?
you can put this guy here .
you're kind of trapped .
right ?
you're trapped !
if i moved this one away you could jump and get kinged .
right ?
if you moved him up here .
then that would be bad move .
you you have to leave him there so it blocks me .
i'm sad because no one brought me a present .
but you didn't tell us .
remember .
dad .
it's the same as that robin hood time .
remember .
when you didn't tell us .
a new case of it is reported at school .
is that right ross ?
marky .
that's not fair .
dad .
if you bounce too much .
you'll make me .
what does that mean ?
you know .
vomit .
throw up .
doesn't he say ?
he says .
ross .
you just make your daddy's life hard .
you know ?
well .
at least it wasn't vacuumed .
gee .
ross .
i've got a lot of work to do .
do you know what i mean ?
and i know what you say .
brian .
shake hands with me !
let's pretend that i didn't know that there was a hard way around and that i couldn't get up .
marky jumped onto me but then but i go go over there and he got here and i jumped and pushed him .
is that pretending ?
no .
that's not pretending .
what were you you pretending ?
we're just pretending the person did that and then they did that .
i see .
for real .
we were really doing that .
then he fell down for real by accident .
one time i jumped on mark .
and it was an accident .
it was an accident .
mark ?
what .
mommy .
what ?
are there six more shows .
the third eye ?
the third eye .
two more .
five and six .
five and six more shows ?
no .
wait .
how many more shows ?
five and six .
that's not right .
it is so !
how many have they had so far ?
one and two and three and four .
and how many are left ?
two .
right .
and what are there names ?
number ?
number five and number six .
good .
how many ?
ha .
ha .
ha .
he said there are two more left .
jump .
mark .
jump .
ross ?
don't push him .
don't push him .
are there six shows .
in all .
how many in all ?
that's what i didn't want you to do .
six shows in all .
in every part of pro in every show of of programming that we like .
ow !
i didn't push you !
ross .
do you know how to put the under roo's away ?
i think .
besides .
i've done it before .
all you have to do is drop drop them in .
right ?
just drop them in the right place .
see ?
did you do a good job on it .
ross ?
okay !
do you want to have any tapes ?
if we have tapes will you leave ?
but i might leave anyway .
then i don't want any tapes .
i'll make you a deal .
if we have tapes then you'll leave and if we don't have any tapes you won't leave and we won't have any tapes okay .
so .
what are we going to do have tapes or not ?
no .
how come ?
well .
i don't want you to leave !
okay !
good .
marky hasta have him first .
of course .
i'll let him have the person .
i just want to use the book i'll just take the book .
mom .
do you know what would be a real pleasure ?
give us ram man !
give it to marky .
well .
just go hide it in a place .
somewhere where no one will will find it .
where marky can't .
where mommy and daddy can't find it !
where marky can't find it .
well .
how are you going to remember in the morning where it is ?
brains .
what do you mean ?
i just put it in my head and i remember it the next day .
ross .
let's talk about whether you should give sean the sword .
now .
why don't you want this ?
well .
why should we when i'm playing with brian .
to be friends with another boy .
dad .
but dad !
now we can't do our hula hoop game .
you what ?
but .
okay !
i understand what you are saying .
but then how is sean going to feel ?
well .
how should i know ?
well .
think about how you feel when other people have you ever ever been a kid and they don't play with you ?
other kids won't play with you ?
but still .
how does that feel ?
we don't feel too bad .
you don't feel too bad in that situation ?
no .
we go and get another group .
just find another kid to play with ?
and then don't you need more that one kid to play with ?
no .
what if no one with play with you ?
no one at all .
well .
i would just sit out of the game and then i would just play play with my brother .
what if your brother won't play with you ?
brothers always play .
well .
what if there really .
really was horrible and even the brother wouldn't play ?
i would just go and eat something .
that's smart .
ross .
he's a smartalec .
isn't he ?
so .
you think sean should've done that .
because no one was being being nice to him he should've just left ?
and ate some food .
that's a good idea .
so you don't ever want to be nice to sean .
no .
how come ?
well .
how do i know ?
well .
how about grandma ?
are you ever going to be nice to her ?
and you know why ?
she always pokes me .
she pokes you ?
she doesn't always poke you .
well she .
she likes you .
ross .
but she does !
grandma really likes you .
she does !
she buys things presents for your birthday .
but she still pokes me .
what if she promised not to do that anymore ?
she still would .
what if we got grandma to promise not to poke you anymore .
would you like her .
then ?
still .
i know she would do that .
no .
but what if she really stopped it ?
she'd still do it .
no .
wait .
ross .
what if she stopped it .
then why would you be mad at her ?
she's so old .
but .
you're going to get old someday .
too .
but not soon !
well .
how old is your mommy ?
how should i know ?
because you should learn how old your mommy is that's how you you should know .
your mommy's thirty eight .
when you write on the the mothers day present for her and on her birthday present you have to to know how old she is .
okay !
okay !
are you going to be mean to old people ?
i don't know .
just because grandma is old .
are you going to be mean to her ?
i don't know !
think about it .
why should i ?
i'm my own body .
so .
you have your own body ?
i can do whatever i want with it .
kind of .
but sometimes you have to think about other people like like sean .
and grandma .
and .
but still .
why do i have to do that .
no one makes you .
and you shouldn't yell .
then why .
if no ones makes me it doesn't make sense and why do i !
have to ?
because people i'll tell you the reason .
do you remember about about god ?
what ?
do you remember god ?
okay !
god wanted people to be nice to each other .
yes .
and still .
why do i have to do it ?
you don't believe in god ?
okay !
well then what makes you want to be nice to other people ?
i only play with my friends .
remember ?
but what if other people were nasty to you ?
i wouldn't play with them .
and you wouldn't have any more friends .
so maybe it's a good idea to be friends with kids .
you know .
so ?
think about it .
just think about the idea of being nice to everybody .
let's think about a world where everyone is nice .
i quit .
i quit drawing because you just am going to make me do things .
i'm not bossing you .
well .
then .
i'm asking you to use your head .
then why do i then why do i have to think about other people .
you don't want to think about other people .
no .
i don't know .
okay !
besides .
i never even think about .
you don't think about being nice to other children ?
how should i know you want me to do it .
tell me !
well think about think about your own brain being nice to other kids .
daddy tell me !
okay !
i'll tell you the rules .
do you want me to tell you the rules ?
no .
when you'll want me to do something when you want me to be be friends with another kid .
then i should tell you beforehand ?
okay !
every time you go to a party with kids .
listen .
let me tell the whole rules .
no .
i'll tell you the whole deal .
i won't do it .
whenever you go to a party with kids .
you have to be nice to all the kids .
i won't do it .
when you go to school .
you have to be nice to all the kids at school .
i won't do it .
i won't do it .
i won't do it .
and when you go on a picnic and a boy scout party .
you have to be be nice to all those kids to .
and you'll have to be nice to all the kids you ever see and when you go to the mall .
you have to be nice to everybody .
close your mouth and keep it shut !
ross .
that's not nice to your father .
your father's heart is going to break .
ross .
jeez .
well .
then .
if it breaks .
you'll die .
yes .
so .
that's it .
and there'll be no more father for you .
well .
i'll still have a mommy .
well .
then you'll be nasty to her and her heart will break .
well .
i'll still have a grandpa and grandma .
but they're too old and you don't love them .
well .
still we have them .
well .
but if you don't love them if you want to just be nice to me .
i'm not really old and i don't poke my finger in you .
and you can have a better deal by being nice to me so i wouldn't die .
well .
i do like you .
you do ?
besides .
but you didn't want to talk about my things i was talking about .
well .
besides i don't understand !
why do i have to do things in my body when i don't want to do them ?
it's not with your body .
ross .
it's not your body you're doing things .
well .
then why do i have to do it when i don't want to do it ?
because you have a good little heart .
you want to really listen to the answer ?
well .
still .
what does that .
wait a second .
wait .
it means that there is an answer to your question .
are you ready to listen to the answer ?
in your heart .
you know .
right here where your heart is ?
you're not listening .
right in here is your heart .
yes .
if you have a good .
lovely chocolate heart .
then you want to be be good to other people .
daddy ?
if you have a mean .
hexy heart heart .
do you know what what were like ?
then you want to be mean to other people .
well .
daddy .
i want to tell you .
are you a ?
i want to tell you .
you mean if you have a candy heart .
you'll be good .
and too bad if if you have a candy heart .
you know why ?
why ?
because the grogg in raggedy ann will eat your heart .
the grogg in raggedy ann ?
now .
if your brother falls .
and you have a warm heart .
then you'll go and you'll help him .
i don't .
you don't have a warm .
nice heart ?
i don't have a warm heart .
but i have a nice one .
you don't to be a friend of brothers ?
see .
i know you love brothers .
dad .
why do i have to do this ?
okay !
no more talking about it .
you're just trying to boss me .
i'm not going to boss you ever again .
i'm finished bossing .
i !
know you have good .
warm heart .
and you'll do it for your own sake and not for mine anymore .
so that's the end of my bossing you .
and i'll never do what you say again .
really ?
really .
that's a dirty trick .
are you going to try to do things so that they'll make me mad ?
no .
no .
okay !
yes !
no .
that's not the dirty trick .
that's not the deal .
the deal is that i just stop bossing you .
and you do the good things for yourself .

isn't he ugly ?
he's the ugliest of all those guys .
he looks like a merman .

okay !
you sit here and tell me the whole story .
you don't want to to do it lying around ?
okay !
now what do you think barry what happens with barry .
what did you figure out ?
well .
he told some of me friends that the fire monster and flier bird then they told me and i found out that they thought that .
and i said .
maybe it's true .
maybe there is a commercial .
and you said may be .
maybe what ?
maybe that they're showing the third one with barry .
the third one ?
what is the third one .
ross ?
the third set of he man .
the third set .
okay !
what are the first two sets of he man ?
what what are the other sets of he man ?
there is he man .
and there's tela and and mer man and .
what set is this .
ross ?
this is the first set .
you already said battle cat .
okay !
and what's the other the second bunch .
there's many faces and zoar .
and there is the attack track and triclops .
who trained to be a good guy but is a bad guy .
and trak jaw .
that is just a bad guy .
and fakir is in between them .
what does it mean .
in between ?
they in between your body .
how do you know that it's in between .
that it's from the middle .
how do you know that it's in between .
well .
how should i know ?
why isn't he .
i'm just a kid !
why isn't he in the first bunch .
what ?
why isn't he in the first bunch ?
why isn't fakir in the first bunch ?
fakir ?
why isn't fakir in the first bunch ?
because he's the last one .
he's the last one to be in the first bunch .
he came out when did he come out ?
when you told us .
when you get .
how do you know that he wasn't really in the first bunch how do do you know that he wasn't part of the first bunch ?
i didn't know that .
at first i thought he was in the middle .
now i !
know that's he's the last one of the first .
he's the last one of the first bunch .
and he man .
but where do you see him ?
where do they and when they make ads .
where do they put fakir ?
they don't add him anymore .
they don't add him anymore .
and what is the third bunch ?
and what is the third bunch ?
the third ?
i think it's fire monster and flier bird .
but don't you think that zoar might be flier bird ?
no .
what does zoar do ?
besides .
even a robot bird this bird would be different .
what would he be ?
he could be a stunt bird that flies and does stunts .
or .
okay !
now .
tell me a story about all the people in the first bunch .
what are they ?
supposing i didn't know about them ?
you don't me to tell you you don't want me to tell .
i don't want to .
but you know something .
ross .
that you didn't figure out .
what ?
you know you know what's in the first bunch because you know all those pictures they used to have on the back .
did fakir ever get in those ?
no .
are you sure ?
i'm sure .
and he never even did .
is fakir in the second bunch ?
no .
so they never put fakir in any of the bunches .
no .
the did .
you made a mistake .
ross .
when ?
at the end of the first bunch .
they started to sneak fakir into into those pictures .
where ?
yup .
they did .
bring me in i'll bring all the books down .
no .
it won't show you in the books .
it was on the backs of the the toys .
and we didn't save that .
why don't we get some new ones ?
how would that prove it ?
why don't we look at them and look at the backs of them .
where are we going to find that ?
where they sneaked them in .
you mean at the toy store ?
i know how you can tell .
the toys have numbers .
issue numbers .
and you can tell on the back of one of the toys .
when they sell all of them they come with their numbers .
you can compare the numbers .
but the interesting thing is that ross realizes that there are two waves of these things that are found .
why i just barely realized realized myself .
and he even hypothesizes that there was a third wave and that these unknown toys that this boy barry was talking about must be part of a third wave of these toys .
i'm sure that there will be a third wave .
what kind of tree doesn't have those things you grow with ?
you mean roots ?
roots .
an orchid .
no .
a raisin tree .
you know why ?
no .
i didn't wear it today .
and i didn't paint on it .
right dad ?
isn't he a terrible little brother ?
no .
he's not as bad as you think he is .
why isn't he as bad as i think he is ?
because he's just littler .
he doesn't understand .
but he does understand some things .
i do understand .
do you understand .
mark ?
yes .
no .
he doesn't .
he does understand ?
what does he not understand ?
nothing .
no .
earlier you said he doesn't understand infinity and some other things .
i said does he know that infinity and four infinity and four makes makes infinity and eight ?
no .
it makes two infinities and eight .
and that is an unreal number .
that's a fantasy number .
did you know that infinity is a fantasy number ?
why ?
because you could never really get there in reality .
in reality you can get to infinity .
i know because your a person and when you get to infinity you're dead .
right .
because you'd have to live forever .
right .
yes .
so it's fantasy .
infinity is fantasy .
good night .
good night .
mom .

and the king's not mean to him .
right ?
right .
and what else ?
i'll sleep down here like a slave .
we're the kings .
we're the kings up here and you're our little servant .
i'm the one that .
you can't have any blankets .
servant .
okay !
you can have a little blanket .
servant .
if you're good .
there .
okay !
we're the the kings .
right ?
but i'm the one that has glasses .
and i picked a blanket out of here .
what happened here ?
maybe it fell * ed-sup .
maybe it fell .
maybe .
but i was up here .
and i didn't see it .
maybe a ghost knocked it off .
he's doing great .
daddy .
good .
marky .
good .
he really is doing well .
isn't he ?
when you were a little boy three years old there were were some things you could do better than what marky can do now .
like you could tell long stories about star wars .
that's because i thought that star wars was the master movie .
and when i was that age .
for christmas .
i only wrote on my list for for christmas star wars toys .
but i didn't get all of the star wars toys .
no .
and why is that ?
because they keep making those toys until the end of their life .
and when do you think they're going to stop ?
when they're all when the people are all dead .
okay !
and how about when return of the jedi is finished ?
and keep it for when they show the movie again .
and they'll put put the extras out .
i see .
but then we won't have any more toys .
we'll have more toys we'll have as many toys as you want .
mark .
you can have as many toys as you want .
isn't that true .
ross ?
mom .
did you know that this is one of the baby care bears ?
it's just that they didn't add him .
ross .

it's just that they didn't advertise him .
but you don't want the baby why didn't they have babies .
ross ?
they didn't grow them .
the babies didn't come out .
why ?
did they stay inside ?
because they .
that's a silly move .

good night darlings .
i told ross that it wasn't wouldn't be fair to cry just because i'm giving a trono to another boy , that's adam just , he shouldn't cry because it makes me think that he doesn't want the other boy to have something nice .
and what did you say then ross ?
what if you got the last one for him and i never could have got one ?
actually he said ".
well just think , what if you had gotten the last one for him ?
you know , the set up of the double hypothetical .
just think what if .
and i never could have gotten one .
how would that have happened ross ?
well you everyone comes all over there and there was only one left and you get that one and then i wouldn't be able to have one .
i see .
i see .
you think it might have worked that way ?
i see .
well maybe .
now a little earlier you told me that you were pretty sure that the trono was for you .
and why did you think that ?
well because you were hiding it .
and i wouldn't and you said i would i w ".
daddy you wouldn't have hided it .
you wouldn't have hid it .
you said you wouldn't have hided it or wouldn't have hid if it had been for me .
isn't that what you said ?
how did you say it ross ?
it was ".
you would have .
and you weren't hiding it from me .
so it has !
to be mine .
but you said .
because it was yours i would have hid it away ?
but it's somebody else's .
somebody el .
do you think it's somebody else's ?
why do you think that ?
well because you said so .
you said it was .
no no !
for somebody else .
okay but you but you thought you say that you think it's for you .
but .
why do you think it's for you ?
well because in the first place i did .
and why did you think so in the first place ?
what was the reason ?
because .
if .
you were hiding it from me then .
then it would be sure to be .
no and the reason was no the reason was that you said that .
i didn't tell you who it was for .
if it was if it wa if it was hi if i was hiding it from you then it was sure to be yours because if it was for adam i wouldn't try to hide it , would i ?
right .
so do you still think that reasoning is good ?
do you still think that's that's good thinking .
or have you changed your mind now ?
well i think that you .
who do you think it's for ?
should show .
it to me if it's for adam .
if it's for adam then why not show it to you right ?
no see if it is !
for adam then !
you do !
then i do show it to you ?
well i'm not going to show it to you so what does that mean ?
it's for me .
you you think now it's for you .
are you sure of that ?
well if you're hiding it from me it's mine .
well if you're not .
maybe i'm just hiding it from adam .
well who ?
well don't worry !
he's not coming over to our !
house !
we're going over to his .
so you think that's a pretty good .
okay .
so what how do you feel about it ?
who's it for at this point ?
who would you guess ?
who would you guess if you hadta guess ?
is it for ross or for .
adam .
i don't know .
you're not sure now .
right .
now daddy keeps on telling you it's for adam right ?
so you can't make up your mind can you ?
right .
well it's tough isn't it .
and i want to kill .
what ?
tell .
no way .
well then .
daddy's are not supposed to tell .
then it should be mine .
daddy's are never supposed to daddy's .
then it's will be mine .
how do you know that ?
if you will hide it from me it's mine because .
you know that he's not coming over right now .
you know something ross ?
what ?
you're right .
so it's mine ?
you're right .
it's for you .
yes .
it is .
it's for you .
you guessed it .
because if i hide it there's no way that i would hide something .
that is for adam if it's for adam why should i hide it right ?
right .
the only reason i should hide it is because i don't want you little kids to see it .
you got it right .
you got the right answer .
dad .
yes son .
do you know what trono is about ?
what ?
do you know what tron is about ?
trono ?
i know the whole story .
you're not going to tell it .
it's the first book of tron before there was tron .
there was a trono .
that's part of the whole that's part of the the trilogy .
that's was the thing they took did to .
to the jedi .
they call it revenge of the jedi .
revenge of the jedi .
and the .
is going to be the next .
next .
no !
is that the next .
which is revenge of the jedi is the whole trilogy ?
that's why .
well that's what the name that they started off with .
well the first name was star wars .
the first one is the book's first movie !
would stop .
second movie .
was .
empire strikes back .
third movie .
revenge of the jedi .
no return !
of the jedi .
no revenge of the jedi could be called return of the jedi instead .
why do we call it that instead ?
aren't we making a mistake ?
no .
they started off with that .
but then they decided that .
they changed their mind ?
it was squeaking .
it's a little bit squeaky brakes on the honda and i and marky said ".
not yet .
and he meant ".
not now .
and i said ".
do you mean not now ?
and he said ".
not now .
and then he s and then i recorded it and he said ".
i said not now .
did you say not yet or not now ?
not now .
that's what you said ?
first not yet , then not now * pn .
not now .
now , sheesh .

not now .
what about ".

that's a crazy word .
that's a crazy way to say things .
okay now everybody you can open your windows if you want some air .
i got out some cereal for the boys , hot cereal .
and marky said ".
i'll just have a little bit .
i'll have the little .

or the least amount .
how do you say , mark ?
what's the right way to say ?
brown a brown kid .
no a brown kid said said ".

and he said .
what's the right way to say , mark ?

drank it down .
he said .
what's his name ?

better believe it's hot because i'm cooling i've cooled mine off .

from the outside .
, mark .
it tastes good from the middle .
but hot .
mark certainly is when he eats french fries .
mark's addicted to salt .
and potato chips .
he he could be .
and fritos .
is that true , mark ?
some some people in this world have .
sit down and you put your mouth closer to your bowl , honey , so you so when you pick it up you don't have to travel quite so far .
and i think doritos .
that's because you're not sitting down like ross is .
that's because you're not sitting close enough .
it's too much work to carry it all the way up and that's why you're you're having a hard time .
there now you'll find it easier .
men buy babies .
that's how men .
you know how men are .
they just buy babies .

didn't you want to know about grandpa ?
you don't want to talk ?
when you were a little boy didn't you want to know about grandpa ?

does that sound like a good idea .
mark ?
here mark .
i'll unwind it .
everybody's talking at once .
what what happened on .
danger mouse .
ross ?
okay .
the penfold ?
was swinging through the trees .
because he got knocked out .
he said he was first he said ".
me !
penfold !
then .
he said ".
me !
lord of the jungle !
and then he said .
and then he crashed into a tree and said ".
in great pain !
me in great pain .
okay .
now ross .
marky's turn ?
okay ?
now mark .
what would you like to say to your father ?
i would like you to .
come on up here .
the .
i thought ross did it already .
he didn't .
he wasn't able to do it ?
no he couldn't this .
to do that .
to .
you mean .
so what did you do ?
i told you the wish that i could have made a wish .
you could have made a wish and you told it to me ?
what was it ?
i wish i had one more dad .
and what would that do for you ?
like and just like you .
and how would that help you ?
by making me better .
and then i will be the best .
the top .
the top of the class .
right .
and they'll give me a new book .
then i'll be the best in that .
and if the other ones will be .
yuck .
what about what about the one daddy who goes to to hungary .
how many daddies are there going to be then ?
two .
and what is one of them going to do ?
go hungary and one's going to stay .
and then what if the one from hungary comes back ?
then what happens ?
the other one its the its the other one's turn .
then where does he go ?
to hungary .
to hungary ?
do they just keep on changing like that ?
that would work pretty well .
wouldn't it ?
would that i've got a better idea .
you could send one of the daddies to when its time for me to teach classes and things at school .
you could send the the other daddy down .
and he would do bad !
i'd just stay home and play with you .
but that guy would do bad and you would be fired .
i'd get fired .
you're right .
that wouldn't work out too well .
no .
let's think of a better idea .
how else could we do this ?
you got any other ideas ?
i got an idea !
ask them for a raise .
and then tell them that he shouldn't have so much work to do .
that's cute that's a good idea .
at work at his office .
then he could come home and really play .
that would really work out great .
daddy .
why haven't we .
do you ever play any of these tapes anymore ?
we was .
trying .
well .
but .
they're all on records now .
maybe we could just give give them to friends now .
no .
i like radio star wars .
and that's not on a record .
no .
that's that's not on a record .
well how about this one ?
we could give this to children's friend .
bozo .
and porky's hiccups .
wait .
what ?
bozo and porky's hiccups .
give them to jj ?
leave my tapes .
because .
if we have to give the records records away .
we'll have the tapes .
we'll have the tapes .
i didn't think about that at all .
and you thought about that .
and these are all on tapes .
all of these guys are on tapes .
yes .
maybe you'd like some of these up in your room .
so you could really listen to them .
right ?
i want all of them up .
now wait a second .
don't get too pushy .
these are the ones that are all orange .
these are the ones these are the ones that are copies .
the the same as on records .
right ?
and these are the ones that are only on tapes .
the ones that we rebinned are the ones that are only on tape .
that's right .
so where shall we put them ?
over on this side ?
we put them over on this side .
right ?
put them right like that ?
okay .
how about these ?
do we move them over ?
so they'll be next to the other ones ?
now your favorites can go upstairs .

what do you think is on it ?
i don't know .

it's like this .
if he .
comes out of his hole .
and doesn't !
see his shadow .

will !
see it .

doesn't see it .

spring will !
be coming soon !

usually .
so where does it come from usually ?
oceans .
comes from the big oceans that live on our earth .
all the big oceans that are there ?

he was one part .
he .
well .
that was one part .
he blowed this whistle and .
he blowed this whistle .
and the mothers said .
told him to .
a long time ago to mind to never do that .
to never do that ?
because its the song for fangor .
its the sound for fangor .
and so did fangor come ?
no .
and what about the chil the boys and the mothers ?
how come they didn't .
it was about this guy that was a wolf .
i know .
i'm trying to have mark tell me .
and one time this guy was looking out the wind out the whoever was looking out the window .
and he turned .
and his eyes turned into just like fangor .

the guy that turned into a wolf lived .
with what ?
the woman ?
no .
went back to his the cruiser .
yes .
and he got back to his own face .
yes .
got his own face back .
and what was this about only the women and the children .
who had lived ?
because they !
won't turn into manglor .
% surprised !
only men !
would turn into fangor .
into somebody like him .
yes .
yes .
who's that ?
i don't know .
well .
i think all of the .
things that came alive were named fang all of them that .
came like him .
were fangor .
fangor .
was the most vicious one .
how did they .
i saw something in the corner of the box .
what did it say ?
i forgot again .
i don't remember it .
did you read it ?
what .
ross .
what about it ?
no grownups or little kids can look at understand it .
and they they can't even see it .
i understand .
then how did you see it ?
well .
i could see those little lines .
i could see it was very little .
what does it tell you ?
that the baby that the mother grown these bears .
yes .
which bears .
ross ?
the pink ones .
yes .
and there's three of them .
i got one of them .
two more left .
are they just the same size and everything ?
well .
but one doesn't have a mouth .
how can it drink milk ?
they don't the little ones don't come with mouths .
i see .
and .
are they the same color as the mommies ?
no .
how come ?
because the inside of the mommies was pink and then they got pink and white and then they got pink and white all over them .
i see .
you mean in mommy's tummy ?
real inside where there was blood ?
well .
there's a little space where they could open a door and go in in and there was pink and white .
that's nice .
and that's where they came when they were babies .
right ?
yes .
is that where they grew ?
well .
then .
did the care bears grow their babies ?
inside them ?
but you said they didn't get fat .
well .
not in the show .
but then later on after the show they grew them .
i see .
neat .
so they can't have any babies on the show .
where did you get the name for the little bear ?
remember .
i saw it on the back of the box ?
on the back of the box .
and the name of the bear is what ?
skyscraper .
skyscraper ?
trust him .
my goodness .
that is quite involved .
they call skyscrapers because you know how big skyscrapers are .
not big at all .
you know .
dad .
you know how they call that big fat guy in robin hood little john ?
it's kind of like that .
wasn't that a joke about little john ?
is it the same kind of joke ?
see .
he's fat i mean he's big and they call him .
but he's not very little !
do you think it's a funny joke ?
what if i called you “he man” .
i wouldn't be he man .
it would be a joke .
it would be a joke .
it would just sort of be a because you're not really a huge muscleman yet .
no .
what if i called you darth vader ?
no .
because i didn't have a lightsaber .
i don't want to have a helmet on and i wouldn't be black all over .
but what if i said that i was just playing a game .
would it be funny then ?
maybe .
but it would be like fantasy .
then .
it's hard to tell the difference between humor and fantasy .
where's my sun thing that hangs around my neck ?
up in your weapons drawer .
but do you suppose that i have to go all the way and climb ?
no .
i'll do it for you .
we can call the weapon drawer the small pieces drawer .

the treasure belonged to a treasure pirate whose name was long john silver .
he lived many years ago with his hand still hooked .
he never knew that when he went to the gold his hand would turn into his left hand would turn back into his real hand again .
so he went into the cave and saw them and they opened the treasure chest and it made his hand better and he said ".
how did it do that .
and they said ".

we don't even know it .
and then they and then the pirate took out the treasure and gave it to some of the friendly animals .

mark .
mommy's about to blow .
you better go to your room .
we don't need you ?
to rattle our .
cages anymore .
you want to see something ?
went to a fur sale .
= yes .
i saw .
jackets .
yes .
curly lamb jackets there were white .
blue fox ones for one hundred fifty eight .
= yes .
blue fox and raccoon .
pieced ones .
two fifty eight .
yes .
designer fox .
jackets and possum .
they were neat .
looking .
yes .
two eighty five .
yes .
here .
you can look at these .
go away mark .
and then there were coats .
for a lot .
yes .
a thousand .
you know .
and some .
but the jackets were fairly cheap .
what do you need this for ?
well .
you know how i wanted to have my jacket my coat done ?
yes .
i went in there to see what they were doing with theirs .
of course theirs were just lovely .
and all brand new fur .
and they were all long fur .
they didn't have any .
karakul .
like mine .
yes .
is curly lamb what you've got ?
no karakul .
curly lamb looks different .
curly lamb's long .
curly lamb was lon white too .
yes .
i though you weren't going to get any more fur coats .
that was your !
concept .
not mine .
i thought when we went to holland .
we .
bought those coats .
well .
i have !
that those nice coats .
i don't really need a coat .
its just that i .
remember i was thinking of taking the coat i have .
yes .
and having it reworked ?
i thought we all we decided about all this .
that we said instead of reworking it .
we'd just get a nice !
comfortable regular coat .
and that we'd end up buying .
two !
of them and that would suffice ?
two really nice coats !
well .
it would kind of do the trick .
when i dragged out that one .
i thought .
you know .
this would be great !
now !
i saw these prices .
now these aren't typical prices .
this is a big deal .
yes .
sale .
ross do you want some fritos ?
okay .
go ahead .
can i !
have some more ?
can i have some more please ?
yes .
here you go .
marky .
but .
i looked at these prices !
and i thought well .
if i .
took my coat in .
yes .
and the price started going up too heavily .
you'd better just get a new one .
right ?
i think well i i think that .
you better not do that anymore .
i !
you ought to learn more about fur .
i felt that .
these are not for you .
ross ate my other ones .
the fur i got .
that's enough .
you eat those and then i'll try and find some more .
the fur i got .
was a dreadful .
cheap one .
the fur was cheap .
right ?
and .
it didn't last very long .
yes .
i really don't think you should repair it .
the collar's good !
= yes .
while i felt my idea for repair was .
good .
but .
it had a a lot of sense to it .
you know ?
but .
the price might get .
beyond .
this .
in which case its stupid .
i guess we have to decide what price .
what grade what kind of fur are you really going for ?
would make it worth it .
you know also .
that a lot of people don't think its right to wear fur jackets .
okay ?
you know your attitude toward smoking in public ?
i think a lot of people would say the same thing about having a fur jacket .
who would ?
you !
would !
i think i do too .
dad i'm done with these .
i think i'd feel the same way .
i'm done with these .
it seems barbaric to me .
i'm done .
okay .
now we want cookies ?
where you going to get cookies ?
what ?
where you going to get cookies ?
there's a big box .
the sack ?
you know what i'm going to do with those .

to the birds because you don't like to eat them .
well .
daddy took them away once .
so i took them out of the garbage and i thought we could .

it would work .
no even if we had more .
it still wouldn't work .

it's too sticky .
maybe we we should try something that's not so sticky .
what do you think would be not so sticky .
ross ?
what ?
what do you think we should try besides honey ?
i don't know .
daddy .
daddy ?
just a minute .

once upon a time .
a long time ago in outer space there was this this little planet full of trees and mountains .
there are these little creatures there who live in these little tents .
they were called ewoks .
ewoks .
the planet of the ewoks had been very old .
the ewoks had made many .
very many .
very less burners there because they loved the beautiful smell of the air .
and they knew and they knew if they burned too much fire for their fire camp when they go out hiking in the mountains it would burn it would burn .
all it would burn their special cave that they had under the ground where all the mountains were covering it .
they kept a little weapons up on up in the little drawer in their little coats of fur .
when they were going out hunting to find firewood they took their little coats and put them on with their weapons inside so if any people tried to take them away they can they can scare them away from them .
how interesting !
and is there more to that story ?
yes .
okay !
and they have these little creatures to ride on named .
named .
named they're named .
they're named treestompers .
really ?
because they loved to stomp on trees .
really .
they eat the little ewoks do not let them because they think that they might step on them by accident .
terrible !
so .
they .
so when they want to step on trees they tie them to the trees instead of stepping on them .
one day when they were going up up in the mountains they put their coats on .
but .
the weapons .
their weapons fell out .
and they were riding up the mountain and a big blob of slime came rolling down the hill .
their little then and the little treestompers did not see it rolling down their wonder cave .
and it was heading right for their weapons when they they heard a little squeak of a mouse that was inside .
they rushed down the hill and into the dwarf .
and the slime was heading to the dungeon to their weapons .
so that he could gobble them up .
so they took those little extra weapons out and aimed them at the slime .
great .
is there anymore ?
do you know anymore yet ?
then they ran to get their weapons .
stuck them on their coat .
but they fell out the hole that they came out .
then that very night they hadta sew the bottom of their pockets so that when they put their little weapons in .
they would stay that way in .
very good .
so the next morning .
when they went out to ride to for firewood .
they were this big planet called mountainflade .
was coming towards was coming towards the mountains and trees of the planet ewokstam .
where the ewoks all lived was coming right to right to smack it .
they went on their horses to the very top of the mountain that reached to the very top of space and they saw this big ball and it was it was mountainstomp .
and it was headed right for their for their home to smash it .
so they took their little weapons and raised them right at it and shot it and it blew up into a thousand pieces .
good .
then some human come popped out of the hole and they said ".
stand still still .
and his the man's name was han solo .
captain of the millenium falcon .
and his copilot .
his wookie .
his five foot wookie was with him .
his copilot chewbacca they call him chewy .
for short .
and they raised their weapons at them and they raised their guns at them .
and they said ".

you won't .
you can swim .
you wear a life jacket honey .

if you do fall in the water it keeps you afloat .
it keeps you up so your head up out of water .
here .
is that small enough ?
does it .
can it make you move ?
no but it keeps your head above water so .
well let me take it back to boston .
and leo is a good sailor and i'm sure nothing will happen in the boat and your daddy will be with you .
okay now those two pieces are five ounces .
harold .
that's what you're allowed ?
and i can have six .
i could have another ounce .
that's an awful lot of meat .
i know so .
you want me to see if your other piece is ready yet ?

no , i'm not going to finish up mine .
that's plenty .
how old are you frank ?

when he swims the length of the pool he can go off the board .
that's going to be quite a while .
he can swim the length of the pool .
can't you ?
where ?
i can swim to the stairs .

where the cat is .
right .
but now they've gotta try to catch him , right ?
there's his whistle .

look on that cat's face .
what's that ?
i guess that's a big pipe .
maybe it's a cannon .
a cannon ?
yes .
it could be a big cannon .
it must be .
think so ?
looks like it .
it's in a big pile of dirt .
right .
and where's the cat going now ?
inside it ?
he's running away .
the policeman came through , and what happened to the policeman ?
what ?
he fell down .
into a river ?
is it a deep one ?
i don't think so , it doesn't look like it , does it ?
no .
and there goes .
and he's all wet .
is that a river ?
is it ?
no .
that's just the sky .
this is the river .
no is that the sidewalk ?
this ?
is this the river ?
where ?
is this ?
it it looks deep to me .
now what's happening ?
the lady .
fell in ?
do you think it's going to be deep ?
the policeman tried to help her .
get out .
of the pipe .
or the cannon .
and then they both fell again .
it looks like it's deep .
what happened to her hat ?
it's going in the river ?
you tell me .

okay .
now you tell me what they're doing .
the policeman and the lady fell in the river head first .
no , you you tell me .
you tell me what are they doing ?
what are they doing ?
he just .
is it deep ?
i don't know .
does it look deep ?
does it look deep to you ?
a little .
about half way up .
what would you do if you fell in the river like that ?
i would , , .
swim back .
really ?
up to the dirt pile .
i see .
and then climb up there ?
what's the cat doing ?
turn the page .
got his hat wet .
they climb back through the pipe .
and then the little boy gets the cat .
and he puts it on top of the policeman's head .
do you think he did that on purpose ?
do you think so ?
look .
do you ?
i don't know .
she's scolding him .

that lady is scolding her little boy .
so maybe he did do it on purpose , ?
is that her little boy ?
i think so .

i don't know .
i don't really know , but i think so .
now what happens ?
he's climbing a tree .
the little boy climbed the tree .
i don't think that's the little boy .
does the little boy have on his shirt ?
batman ?
that's the policeman climbing the tree .
doesn't look like .
what's the little boy doing here ?
i don't know .
he's sticking his tongue out .
yes .
it's true .
that isn't very nice , is it ?
why ?
well he's sticking his tongue out at the policeman .
or the cat .
i don't know which .
maybe the little boy doesn't like the cat .
what do you think ?
do you think that's the policeman ?
cause he's got the badge on .
see ?
he doesn't have .
his hat .
he lost his hat .
remember ?
where ?
in the river i think .
now he lost .

in the carriage .
i like this page .
do you like that page ?
no .
i i like .
i like the one where they say ".
head first .
head first .
why do you like that one ?
do you think it's really deep ?
well it can't be deeper than their waist .
you're in deeper than that in the pool .
what ?
cause your feet don't even come to the top when you stand on your head .
right ?
so you could swim in that , couldn't you ?
what ?
in that river .
i can stand on it too .
what're you looking at ?
okay , so did you like .
wait .
we've missed the last page of the story .
they all went home .
and now they're , , both in the carriage .
did you like that story ?
it's just a picture story .
i know .
we don't read very many picture storys .
do we ?
no .
well .
would you like to play with the other thing in that box ?
do you want to go .

well , she's she went out of the room .
here , we'll put .
can you put this back in the box ?
when will she be back ?
i don't know .
can you get the other thing from the box ?
i don't want it .
what is this thing ?
i don't know .
why don't you sit over here , frank ?
why don't you sit over here ?
honey , sit over here .
no .
please .
come on .
why ?
cause i want you facing the other way .
there .
right here ?
do does this remind you of a truck which you use to have once ?
i don't .
i didn't used to have one .
did i ?
long time ago .
i have ?
i don't remember .
what did you do with those things ?
i i remember i had * one of these .
can i unscrew this ?
do whatever you want .
i'll try .
i don't know if i can .
no that's .
that's not the way to unscrew it .
this is the way to unscrew it .
there .
now i screw it back in .
why don't .
do you want to take it all the way apart and see if we can put it back together again ?
okay , then .
how do you take this part ?
i don't know .
well that should .
let's see .
how do we figure this out ?
this is the way .
think we can get this back together if we take it all apart ?
i don't know .
maybe not .
remember where the things was .
look at all those things in there .
these are the motor .
i see .
right ?
is that the motor ?
i guess it is .
take this out .
i can't get this out .
you have to take this thing off .
this .
this is the trunk , right ?
no .
what is it ?
the hood .
that's the trunk .
this the trunk .
there's a tire .
i bet that's what that other screw went to .
what ?
that red screw .
what red screw ?
that was out .
remember ?
, there's only four wheels .
i know .
but what is that called ?
member when you when we got a flat tire the other night ?
that's why that tire is in there , so that when you have a flat tire you can change .
to a new tire .
there's already a hole in here .
well .
what's this ?
this is the trunk .
want to take all the wheels off ?
i think you're turning it the wrong way .
here .
you gotta use the , .
what's this ?
screwdriver ?
this way ?
i don't know .
maybe it's this way .
there .
you already had it unscrewed .
try that one .
no , it's the other way .
so what about these ?
i don't know if we can put it back together .
i don't know either .
we might not .
well we'll try .
you want to unscrew them ?
what if we can't ?
i don't know .
we just have to do the best we can .
i think we can figure it out .
what did you see at the fire station today ?
i think we saw a fire engine .
did did they go out on a fire while you were there ?
no .
, were there firemen there ?
and andrea was afraid .
andrea was afraid ?
i don't know if we can put it .
so, .
what else is there to take apart ?
do you think we'll ever get this back together ?
could i use the screwdriver ?
you think we'll ever get this back together again ?
no !
no way .
okay .
we'll never .
and there goes one more thing .
and these .
okay % whispered, okay .
now .
what shall we start with first ?
i will never .
what that with these ?
okay, we'll see .
is the door locked ?
no i don't think so .
it's just .
just we need the screwdriver .
we need the screwdriver .
well i don't know .
it doesn't go through there .
, i know .
what ?
cause you know why ?
cause this hasta go on first .
see ?
remember ?
okay .
okay ?
this this one goes .
now okay .
like this .
so what did andrea do when she got scared ?
well , she didn't go on the fire engine .
okay .
i did .
did just mr f and mrs k go with you ?
and andrea .
andrea did .
andrea didn't stay alone .
no .

no .

on his hair .
, he did .
and there's a new , , friend at school named ava .
ava ?
and she and went in the bathroom .
turned the sink on .
and put her hair in there , and then washed it .
and got it wet .
okay , now what're we going to do next ?
do the sides .
now .
i know .
there .
that's it .
no it's this way .
no because then the wheel fits into there , ?
wait .
okay , now ho now i'll hold this .
where's the screw ?
this it ?
i think so .
maybe the other .
you know what ?
what ?
we have to screw this on to it .
like that .
you have to put this in .
see ?
and then it'll stay .
okay .
now , you screw this .
this way ?
okay , now you do this side .
i hope we didn't forget anything .
now .
there's something under there .
now we have to put another one in here like this .
see ?
and then you need a what ?
a wheel ?
there .
okay .
now why did josh put the milk on his hair ?
he didn't .
somebody somebody lifted up somebody .
i think it goes the other way .
somebody lift .
this way ?
somebody lifted up and poured it on his head .
who's somebody ?
ava .
, ava .
where's ava from ?
i don't know .
i don't think this fits .
let's see .
maybe we need a bigger .
we need a bigger one .
there , see if that fits .
yep , i think that fits , don't you ?
yep .
there .
okay , !
now this side .
okay .
where's some ones that fit this ?
what color were they ?
we need that square thing first .
here's one .
no that one didn't fit .
remember ?
is there another one ?
another color ?
there's only three .
how bout that yellow one ?
this one ?
but there should be another yellow one .
there it is underneath there .
okay .

like this ?
that's right .
okay .
, there's another one .
there's one more yellow one .

i want to do it .
i want to do all of it .
okay .
now .
now we need .
now .
where's the trunk ?
where where do we put this in ?
that was the motor .
so that would go .
in the front of the car .
i know .
right here ?
that went in here , but was there something else that went with it ?
no ?
i guess that just went right there .
the other way .
suppose that .
you suppose there's something under here that we're supposed to do ?
you know i .
, i see that .
that's where that other yellow thing goes .
can you put it in there ?
here ?
you know what we've gotta do ?
what ?
we gotta stop this .
and s start on this one , okay ?
wait .
okay ?
maybe after we're all through with this we can go back to this , okay ?
no .
i know how .
i want to .
but we have to finish and do something else , honey .
why ?
see this ?

some .
some were some , .
were some were late ?
and things like that and they were probably on there .
the tire fence , on the top .
it was really funny .
you could make horsies like .
take a tire and put .
a tire standing up here and bury it .
then , take another tire and put it .
like the tire's here buried right there , then you put .
no , i mean .
first there was a tire tire flat on the ground .
then they would take a tire and stand it up .
i see .
i see .
and then you could bury another tire here , and so there is two tires .
here standing up .
, i see .
and then you could take another tire and put it on top of these ones , .
ride on it .
that'd be fun .
brian , i've got another way to make .
horsies .

let's go figure it out okay ?
let's see .
what does this do firstname ?
i don't know !
maybe a box ?
let's see what it does .
what did you make it do ?
i wonder if you hold your finger there a long time you can make it do something different ?
now what what happens if you turn the light on does it .
what if you cover up a different one can you see this one .
can you figure out what it's doing ?
how do you make it do different things ?
no .
no ?
look a green light just come in that's my favorite color .
now what happens if you touch a yellow one ?
see some of these are yellow ?
push a yellow one and then push another one .
what's it do ?
is it doing it somewhere else ?
nope .
guess that's it ?
what's in the back ?
right here .
i got it .
it's requesting a song .
it doesn't do very much does it ?
yes i do !
you do ?
uh-yes .
how'd you figure that out ?
i don't know .
how'd you make it do that ?
you know how ?
i pushed up here .
see ?
i see but but does it does it do the same thing every time you push it ?
no ?
it does something different ?
when's the lady going to be back ?
she said we got five minutes to play with this .
but how come she isn't coming back ?
because it's not five minutes yet .
why do you not like this ?
want to play something else ?
you can't play with something else until she tells you .
did you like this or not ?
i do like this .
you do ?
it's got lots of lights on it .
when you were a little baby you used to always say light bulb on .
you would have loved this thing .
because you'd always say light bulb on light bulb off light bulb on light bulb off .
you know that ?
you you need to turn my light bulb off when i go to nighttime bed .
how come ?
because its not a real word .
it's silly .
yes .
is it doing anything ?
uh-yes .
what's that noise ?
what if you hold that one and i hold this one ?
what do you think will happen ?
anything ?
what if we don't touch it at all ?
what happens if we don't touch it at all ?
i don't know .
let's watch it for a minute and see what happens .
if we don't touch it at all does anything happen ?
it lit up .
it's not doing anything .
okay if you don't touch a button .
can you see inside that hole ?
is there anything in there ?
nope .
see you weren't pushing it there .
what if we go like this ?
i think that works too .
alright that was great !
are you ready for the next one ?
sure .
let me cover this one .
here you go !
do i have to close my eyes now ?
do you want to ?
okay .
this is the next one .
alright you can open your eyes !
boy !
i'll be back in fives minutes .
what's in there ?
can he touch ?
is he allowed to touch ?
i don't know if we're allowed to touch in there .
probably not .
firstname !
what's in here ?
you see anything in there ?
mom i see a lot of flower things .
what's that ?
do you know what that is back there ?
i think it's a snake .
nope not a snake .
they live in the water .
usually crawl around the bottom .
you know what it's called ?
what's it look like ?
well .
sorry !
sorry shock .
what's it look like ?
an octopus it looks like .
kinda !
it kinda looks like an octopus but its not .
it's a starfish .
it's called a brittle star .
it's a special kind of starfish that has really really long arms .
and it's a saltwater critter .
and he's just kinda hanging out there .
i don't know if we're allowed to touch him though i don't think so .
probably not .
you want to go around this side ?
you can see him better ?
you can see the underneath of him there .
see what he looks like over here ?
see all these little things sticking out that looks like hairs ?
that helps him grab on when he's walking along the bottom .
and can you see in the back ?
that part there's like a little round hole right in the middle of him ?
uh-yes .
on the underside ?
can you see it ?
if you look in here it looks like a mirror .
look this way honey .
see in here ?
look this way but look at the back of the tank .
see how it looks like a mirror and you can see his underneath back there ?
you see the part that looks like a hole ?
right in the middle ?
yes .
that's his mouth .
that's how he eats .
you know what when you know what happens when starfish eats ?
no .
he spits his stomach out of his mouth and his stomach wraps around his food and he digests it and brings it back into his mouth .
they don't have teeth like we do .
and you know what else ?
what ?
if a starfish's leg breaks off they can grow more .
if one of his arms breaks off or gets eaten by a fish he can grow a brand new one .
what if no hair .
no it'll have hairs just like the one that he has now !
i wonder how many legs he has .
can you count how many legs he has ?
can you see ?
can you see for a minute ?
no i can't i have to come .
okay come here this is .
hiding .
how many legs does he have ?
don't know .
count !
i don't i don't know .
i think some are behind it .
no well .
well there's five .
five ?
how do you know ?
because i can see them .
and this is like some kind of coral some kind of rock formation .
yes .
and see that green thing back there ?
that's a heater .
that keeps the water warm .
because he's gotta have warm water or he won't live in there .
i wonder if there's anything else in there i don't see any other fish or anything in here ?
are there any more surprises ?

because then it'll spill and that poor little starfish won't have anywhere to live .
okay ?
that's his house .
if it goes up ?
no don't throw it over there .
if it goes up the starfish will have a grand time here .

you wouldn't like it if somebody did that to your house right ?
my home ?

if somebody knocked it over you wouldn't like it right ?
no .
well he wouldn't like it either .
he's pretty fuzzy .
he's kinda cute .

i'll bet there is .
can he see himself in the mirror ?
he can .

thanks for asking .
look at that !
i'm going to go on the other side okay ?
how come ?
because i want to see his face .
i can see his face over here .
look at that !
you know i think i think that's a chinchilla .
i think it's a guinea pig .
it's kinda like a guinea pig but i think it's a chinchilla .
they have really really soft fur .
see this hole this tube thing ?
yes .
they like to climb through those .
hello !
knock .
hello .
knock on it .
well you can tap quietly .
we don't want to hurt his ears .
just quietly .
he's a pretty color .
but he's not my favorite color .
he's got a little bit of gray in him .
little bit .
in his ears ?
you can see gray in his ears .
maybe we can get him to run through the hole .
let's see maybe he'll come .
maybe he'll fall on his side when he runs through the hole !
i don't think he's going to do anything .
i think he's just going to sit there .
see i think he's been chewing on this .
see all the rough edges ?
sometimes they like to chew on stuff too .
even on people ?
they can bite that's why she put the top on .
that's why she said not to touch .
because they have teeth .
they can bite .
right ?
mommy told you that any animal that has a mouth can bite you right ?
yes .
right .
that's why we don't touch .
that's why mommy asked .
okay ?
he's really looking at me there .
say hello !
i wonder what his name is .
did you know that people used to make coats out of them ?
coats ?
yes .
out of tail ?
out of their fur because it's so soft .
but i don't think he would like it if you took his fur do you ?
well hello !
i saw his teeth .
he has pretty big teeth .
here .
maybe if you look down right here .
don't get too close .
but maybe if you put your face up and look down at him maybe he'll look up at you and you can see his teeth .
okay ?
there you go .
don't yell at him he'll run away .
he looks cute !
i wonder .
is he looking at you ?
now don't be goofy at him !
maybe he'll may maybe he'll .
you'll scare him .
maybe if i do something that he like he might crack up .
you think ?
i never saw a chinchilla laugh .
i have never saw a brown one .
you know what ?
i never saw a brown one either i only saw a gray one .
you know what ?
all the other chinchillas i've seen have been your favorite color .
they've been gray .
i know .
maybe when they get bigger they turn more gray .
you see he's a small one .
i've never saw one that small before .
look firstname !
look !
he's looking at you !
see ?
he's .
look at him from the top maybe you can see his mouth and his eyed .
i think he's going to go through the tube !
maybe .
go in there !
go !
i want to see him go through the tube .
me too .
that would be kinda cool .
going to go around the other way .
hello !
okay .
i think he likes to move .
i think he likes you .
he's looking at you .
he says i want to get outta here !
open that top and let me outta here !
that's what he says .
i think he's trying to open it .
i think he's hoping is that we'll open it .
but we're not going to .
i hear him .
i think he's telling the lady not to touch something .
hello !

he's goofy .
look at those long whiskers he's got .
he does !
i wonder what he eats .

this otter isn't as exciting as that moving dog right ?
there's no mystery to this one .
i'm controlling him .
how are you doing it ?
it's a stuffed animal .
see ?
see ?
well let's make up a story about him .
what do you think his name could be ?
and look his eyes have a lot of feeling in them .

okay .
so all the lights are flashing now .
green .
there's that .
how about both ?
okay try that .
you know i'm not sure what makes each pattern but it looks like you have to be in front of these things to make it go but i don't know if these two makes it go a certain way .
like if we wanted all the lights to shine at once which one would you press ?
this one .
let's try it .
so press this button up here and all them light .
right .
and there's no sound now .
i'm not sure of the code to this i'm not sure if what we're doing is making it work a certain way or if it's fine to keep trying .
it's this way .
see ?
yep this is the key .
this is the key .
now what if i wanted certain lights shown ?
all these sounds mix with all the lights .

we could bang on there .
what is that thing for ?
i think that there's a water bottle that they can stick through there .
it's like a straw .
it's a bottle with a straw at the bottom and you sick the straw out and the hamster can drink the water .
no what it is ?
that's what i'm talking about the bottle fits in here like a can .
you know like a can of soda and then you put a straw in it and stick the straw through so that you can drink it .
well it just holds the bottle so the bottle doesn't roll all over the place .
because it if you didn't have it held in the bottle could go over here and then he wouldn't have anything to drink .

he could be a big rat .

it's good you remembered to ask .
i almost forgot .
actually the something else is one of these .
this one .
want to help me uncover this one ?
okay let's just pull this cloth right off .
there you go .
you can look at that one for a little bit .
what is it ?
i don't know .
can i touch it ?
i think you can touch it because she didn't tell you not to .
and i think the point of the experiment is to see what things you like to touch .
i think you can touch it .
see what happens .
what happened ?
what are you doing ?
playing .
just playing ?
to see what happens ?
do you like it ?
you think so ?
does it make a difference where you touch it or not ?
that's the only button that does anything ?
this one .
you want me to try ?
i can't get my little finger in there .
nothing happens .
that's just lights to me .
i can't .
we'll cover its nose .
it didn't like that did it ?
that means yes it did .
it means it did like it ?
good .
when i do it but not you .
it didn't like it when i did it but it's when you do it ?
i see .
pretend that this were my computer .
is that your computer ?
okay .
it's help .
okay .
and then you said that that honey do you want some help ?
and i said no i can do it by myself .
and it will make noise and it will make noise .
and you made it believe me and you said a lot of stuff .
okay .
so it's your computer and i'm supposed to say honey do you want some help ?
and we .
okay i'll say it now .
okay honey do you want some help ?
no !
well will it make some light ?
yes .
you sure you don't want any help ?
i'm sure .
okay .
are you sure it's your computer ?
okay .
it's not mine ?
no .
it's not daddy's ?
how do you know it's yours ?
because i opened it up .
because you opened it up ?
told you it's mine .
you want me to know how to make things work .
what's that thing in the middle then ?
touch it mommy .
you know what that reminds me of ?
what ?
where have we seen lights that can see you and when they see you something happens ?
and in bathrooms too ?
remember sometimes you see lights and then the water goes on .
you put your hand underneath it it sees that you're there .
no that's a face mom .
this is a face ?
no right here .
you can't move it can you ?
do that .
can you push the top ?
i should do it now ?
okay .
it did something different .
can i do it again ?
you have to wait until it's coming .
what if i don't take my finger off ?
hi .
you ready for the last one ?
okay i'll cover this one back up .
what do you think the last one is ?
i don't know .
maybe that one over there ?
the last one .
okay let's find out .
ready ?
there you go .
you can look at that for a little bit .
what is that ?
what ?
an octupus .
is it an octupus ?
come here .
i don't know .
there's a lot of creatures in here .
there's a lot of creatures in there ?
is it an ecosystem ?
i don't know .
how would we know if that's an octopus ?
look at that pink thing .
look at the pink thing .
the pink thing ?
the little tiny thing ?
that can be .
a little tiny worm .
look at all .
i don't know what it is either .
it's got tentacles doesn't it ?
okay mom let's count .
count tentacles .
one two three .
one two three four .
one two three four five .
five tentacles .
so can it be an octupus ?
no .
octupus's have how many legs ?
six .
no .
seven .
they've got .
nope .
eight .
eight .
like an octagon has eight sides .
like a stop sign .
so that isn't an eight legged octopus .
it could be a five legged one but maybe it's just a different kind of animal .
we'll ask her when she comes in .
we'll have to ask her .
she said when you're done playing she'll tell you all kinds of things ?
and look it .
that can move .
so it must be a creature .
a pink worm .
it's a what ?
a creature ?
a cree because because it must be a creature .
it's moving .
hmm .
maybe it thinks i'm pretty .
maybe it does think you're pretty .
what's that red thing ?
do you think it's pretty ?
what's that red thing ?
the red thing ?
i don't know .
i i want to go back over here .
she's got some explaining to do doesn't she ?
i want to go back and get those worms .
hu !
it fell .
it fell ?
is it a starfish ?
maybe it's a starfish .
because how many legs do a starfish have ?
i don't know .
maybe starfish do have five legs .
that's a good guess honey .
a skinny legged starfish .
this tank is very dirty .
it is a dirty tank isn't it ?
what do they need ?
or is it food ?
or is it food ?
well that's true .
maybe that's a kind of food these things eat .
what we think is dirt might be food to them .
it's moving .
it's moving .
i think it looks like something you would find on the bottom of the sea or something .
if it's a starfish i can hold it ?
i don't think we can hold it .
i'm just kidding .
you could if you were a mermaid and lived at the bottom of the sea .
but i don't think we go in there .
what's that little green thing ?
what is that little green thing doing ?
they're together .
they're together aren't they ?
i think it's hiding from that .
it's trying to hide ?
the pink .
the pink thing's hiding from the bigger one ?
i think so .
maybe .
i'm thirsty .
you're thirsty ?
we'll get you a sippy cup for you when we're done .
this is the last one she said .
i know .
it's certainly been interesting .
where is my sippie cup ?
daddy has it .
we'll get it after .
i'm cold .
what is it doing ?
maybe this thing is called .
what do you think it is ?
i think you might be right .
it could be some kind of starfish .
okay what else do you think it is ?
what else do i think it is ?
i don't know .
maybe it's an alien from another planet .
no mom !
it's not ?
okay .
silly mommy .
i don't know what it is then .
well .
you think it's a kind of a plant maybe .
or a starfish .
or a starfish .
it could be .
one two three four five legs .
five legs !
where is the food in this place ?
i don't know .
these are toys .
alright you ready for .
what is that ?
well you know what we'll talk about that too .
we'll talk about all those things okay ?
okay .
it's waving his , its arms .
it's waving its arms .
it's a it's a starfish .
don't you think it is .
what is that ?
is that corral ?
i think that is corral .
there's a lot of them .
and look here .
what's this ?
is that alive ?
no .
i'm not sure .

i'm not sure .
is it is it .
look in that rock .
there's something pink underneath there .
that looks .
that looks .
i wonder what it is .
i don't know what it is .

that's pretty cool .
where do you think they're from ?
the ocean .
the ocean ?
yes .
they're nice .
you think they're happy in here ?
uh-yes .

do you think those rocks .
those corral things are houses for them ?
yes .
that's how they .
that his house there .

uh-yes .
maybe that maybe that is grandpa .

maybe .
or maybe that big one owns a lot of children so that so that's his house that's their house and that no one's house !
i wonder who does live there .

hamsters don't have long tails and he has a long tail .
if he was a hamster he would have a a spinning wheel .
he would have a spinning wheel ?
i would be .
all hamsters have spinning wheels ?

she maybe its a she .
not sure .
look at the little teeth .
he's funny .
he is .
or she .

he has whiskers like a cat .
yes he does have whiskers like a cat .
this is a fun experiment you get to see lots of things don't you ?

and maybe they'll tell us what it is .
maybe they'll tell us what it is .
where do you think they got it ?
he poops !
it does doesn't it ?
that is a tiny poop .
yes it makes little tiny poops .
it bites !
at least .
it's at least he doesn't bite too hard .
maybe it's just trying to trim your fingernails .
funny little hamster buddy .

it has an itch .
maybe we could .
you bit to degu !
nibbling ?
trying to .

why not ?
he he there's no of these in the desert .
that kinda looks sandy .
i bet he likes .
maybe he lives in holes .
or maybe he lives in .

maybe she don't know where it live .
maybe she got him from a pet store .
maybe .
what do you think he eats ?
or she eats ?
this bedding .
this stuff ?
do you think that's food or just something for him to walk on ?
i don't know .
maybe it makes it easier to clean up the poop .
no it doesn't .
no ?
he could bury it !
like a kittie .
or a doggie .
what do you think you would feed him if you had to take care of him ?
this bedding .
stuff ?
to degu .
he's adorable .

i think it looks more like a meerkat .
and they live kind of in a dry place .
how about this is the dry place .
that's the dry place ?
and that's the water !
and when they stand up like that they're looking to make sure it's safe .

no peeking over there .
now she's going over here and .
she's swimming ?
she's hot .
she is swimming and she's drinking the water up .
and now she drank all the water so she can't swim .
she drank all the water .
she can't swim if she drank all the water !
now she's gone .
she she jumped through the water .
my goodness .
see ?
yes .
maybe she could be the baby and you could be the mama .
you you be the mama .
and you'll be her sister ?
yep .
you could be a meerkat too ?
or an otter .
whichever she is .
she's a meerkat .
she's a meerkat ?
because meerkats usually look like that .
and those big eyes ?
and otters don't have a tail .
i don't .
i think otters have tails .
no they don't .

little little stubby tails ?
maybe this big a tail .
just this big ?
how big is her tail ?
that big ?
no .

firstname would love to see this .
he would ?
he wouldn't , .

firstname !
you nut !
i like these shorts .
their blue blue .
alright here is the next one .
cool .
i knew that .
have you ever seen .
alright what do you do with him ?
you push this button .
a ha ha !
look it .
he sits .
what happens if you clap your hands ?
it's walking !
ruff !
looking for something to eat .
he's walking mom .
stop it .
i was covering the light to see what would happen .
where is he going ?
come back here .
stop it !
look at him eat .
he's going to come get you .
he's backing up !
i see !
i think he's going poo .
he's going potty .
touch it .
there's one on his head too .
you just like to see him go potty .
he doesn't bark very loud does he ?
i did something .
see it clap once .
he's coming to get you .
i guess when he sees you he kinda backs up .
when he gets too close .
say si .
tell him to sit .
sit !
sit .
i don't know .
have you ever played with one of these before ?
sit .
let's see what if you .
he's looking at me .
woof !
let's turn .
bye bye dog .
sit !
heel !
what does heel mean ?
come back and stay by your heel .
i'm trying to make him walk .
let me see him .
does this button work ?
yes .
woof !
sit !
okay bark !
bark !
beep .
bark !
i wonder what it's it's front part does .
woof !
let's see what he does when you clap .
hi .
can we turn the air on in here .
is it getting a little warm ?
it's really starting to get warm .
okay , are you ready for the next one ?
okay .
that was a cool one .
that was a more interesting .
okay , here's the next one .
my goodness !
cool !
now can he get loose or no ?
nope .
he stays in the cage ?
okay .
yes .
there you go .
what's his name ?
you guys can talk about that .
okay .
alright , i guess we're supposed to think of that .
do you know what he is ?
a hamster ?
nope .
guinea pig ?
it's what they had in the library .
i forgot .
remember they're awake in the daytime ?
they're degus .
degus .
say that .
yep .
degus .
looks like they just put him in his cage .
cool .
hi little guy .
too bad we can't get you out and pet you .
i wonder if he bites .
you can pet him probably pet his nose .
he probably wants to go back and curl in his regular cage .
isn't that interesting ?
did it tickle ?
remember the degus are the .
because the hamsters and the gerbils usually sleep during the day .
and they wheel around at night .
and these guys are the opposite .
they like to play in the daytime when you're awake .
and then sleep at night when you sleep .
that's pretty cute .
that's pretty cute .
touch the nose ?
look at his yellow teeth .
where's yellow ?
he's got yel .
can you see his teeth ?
they're yellow .
look at his paws .
he's got four like four fingers ?
i see .
and they're like .
kinda like that .
what would you name him if he were yours ?
firstname .
you'd name it firstname ?
like like we we used to read in those magazines ?
firstname and firstname .
firstname and firstname ?
now see his teeth ?
some .
they must have to cut them a little bit so they don't they don't bite .
they don't get too sharp and chew .
or maybe they they're just like that .
or they'd have kids getting their fingers bit .
i touched i got his nose .
i wish i could touch even touch him .
they must put the food in up here .
he's seeing if we have any food for him to eat .
we do .
this is an interesting cage .
cool i touched him .
what ?
i wonder what they use this for .
careful he's going to bite you .
did he did he lick you ?
he didn't bite you did he ?
no .
careful .
do we think kittie would like one of these .
firstname would like it .
course you guys would want to hold him and he'd get loose .
and then we'd never find him .
just like the hermit crabs did .
they didn't get loose .
someone forgot to watch them and they got away .
i know .
i remember .
don't get your finger stuck .
or he might go ha ha i got a free finger .
he looks pretty well fed though , doesn't he ?
i can look see him in the mirror .
you can see him in the mirror ?
look icky yicky .
ow .
he just bit me .
no he .
it didn't really hurt .
well don't put your finger in his mouth .
it didn't hurt .
okay .
he's cute .
this is definitely not a toy .
exactly .
why not ?
because it's alive .
very good .
that's true .
he's not a toy is he ?
i don't think so .
you can tell them what toys are .
maybe they don't know .
not much you can do with with this toy except watch him .
you can't really train these guys to do much i don't think .
nope .
what do you think of this one ?
did you like this one ?
he said it's not a toy though .
okay .
alright well the next one is one of these that's covered up .
this one right here .
do you want to help me uncover this one ?
let's pull this off and then see what's under it .
there you go .
what's inside .
well i guess you're kinda going to have to look around .
maybe from over here .
here .
wait i see some right there .
a starfish !
there .
cool .
it moves fast .
okay i'll be back in a few .
here why don't you pull up a chair too .
awesome !
neat .
look at how fast it does it .
i've never seen one like that before .
or is that a .
sea urchin .
i see three four five things though .
it looks like a starfish .
like the little centipede thingy .
look at his little legs .
they stick on the glass .
there's one right there .
it looks like a it looks like a cactus .
with little picky things .
are those poisonous ?
are those poisonous ?
i don't think so .
i think those are just so he can feel around in a place .
well can we hold one ?
i don't think so .
we can ask her when she gets back .
i want to see see his mouth .
he sitting his mouth is on the other side .
can you see ?
are the little legs moving ?
yes .
like little hairs .
yes .
i thought it was a fish or a turtle or something like that .
but i've never seen a star starfish in michigan .
well i'm not sure if this is a starfish .
it's an unusual starfish .
that look like sh stars .
so maybe this is something different .
he's go he's trying to go back under his rock and hide .
you want to come over here so you can see him .
bless you .
look .
it's funny the little cave .
i don't know .
what do you think it is ?
it's not an octopus .
starfish .
because octopus have eight legs .
starfishes have five .
this doesn't look like a typical starfish .
itchy ?
look at this thing here .
what do you think this is ?
an i don't know .
it's a thermometer .
so you they can keep track of how the water hasta be a certain temperature .
so see that little line right there ?
these are the degrees here on this left side .
looks like it's about between the seventy-five and the eighty .
so it's probably around seventy-eight degrees in the water .
is that cold or hot ?
it's kind of cold actually .
that's not too warm .
but the ocean's pretty cold .
so it's probably just right for that guy .
what do you think his name would be ?
i want to name it a different name though .
does he look like pets ?
firstname .
firstname ?
firstname .
firstname .
don't pull out the cords .
well they're probably not .
but if i pull them out what will happen ?
if you pull them out it will turn off the light .
and then there's a filter .
see the bubbles coming out there ?
and that helps keep the oxygen in the water and keep it moving around .
and that's this filters to keep all the junk out of the water .
so it stays clean for the guy .
there's junk right there .
then they change it .
look at all that algae .
that's algae forming on that .
the tanks have to be .
where ?
see on the back of the glass ?
that hasta be cleaned every once and a while .
lots of sand .
i wonder if it's a boy or a girl .
i'll say it would be a boy .
why ?
because it looks like one .
it looks like a boy ?
what would a girl look like ?
i don't know almost the same .
that looks what it would look like when it's when it's under a rock .
if you were just swimming by and you saw that what would you think it was ?
octopus a little octopus .
maybe .
well it looks , you know it kind of looks like sea grass too .
like it may be a plant .
the way the legs kind of wave around .
uh-yes i think they .
so maybe that's the way it tricks fish .
and try and get their prey when they're hungry .
yes what was that ?
a clown fish ?
sorry .
am i blocking the door ?
it wasn't a clownfish .
what kind was it ?
alright .
we'll we have the next one ready .
it wasn't of course it's not a clownfish .
did you like this one ?
are you having a fun time ?
good .
there's this the next one's going to be this one .
and then there's one more after that one .
and then i'll come in and ask you some of your ideas about some of these things okay ?
so let's look at this one next .
do you want to help me uncover this one ?
here let's take this right off .
there you go .
now you can look at that one for a little bit .
what is it ?
well try to figure that out .
well we'll try and figure it out .
a game ?
maybe it's a game .
neat .
what if you cover this one up ?
cool .
do these do anything ?
boring .
well we have to figure out how it works .
see if you do that in the middle it makes a sound .
touch it in the middle with your finger .
okay what about .
let me try .
if you cover all of them it goes crazy .
okay take one hand away .
let's just do it .
what happens with one hand .
take them all away .
okay now let's find out what one here .
take it all away !
do you .
okay .
and i think it takes whoever or whatever .
okay .
me .
me .
that's you .
so i .
you .
nope that was you .
so your turn .
i think i won .
me .
me .
me again .
okay .
you again .
that was neat .
it went around in a circle .
it spiraled .
that's cool .
did you see it go around ?
you .

yep .
me .
yes .

well now i'm going to get a chance to ask you your ideas about some of the things you saw .
okay firstname ?
okay .
okay how about if you sit in the green chair ?
uh-yes .
alright .
cover this one up .
do you want to do you want to roll it over to me and i'll roll it back to you ?
wait .
it matches your clothes !
look at that !
wait .
look .
what ?
there's no engine in that car .
there's no engine inside of there .
wee !
i know somebody who would really like this toy .
firstname .
firstname .
what else should we do with it ?
any ideas ?
why don't you see what else you think that toy's good for .
dropping off of its booty .
how about like this .
wee !
it goes pretty far when you do that doesn't it ?
you should see how far you can make it go ?
road block !
badump badump .
under the hill .
up the hill .
rrrrr .
ready ?
vroom .
wee !
watch this .
uh-oh .
that reminds me of one hundred and one dalmations .
why ?
when cruella deville went over the edge of the mountain remember ?
when she was chasing the puppies ?
road block .
somebody move this big road block away so i can get through !
watch this .
watch this .
i take this away .
uh-yes .
that helped a little but not a whole lot ?
how much minutes is it ?
i think we still have a few minutes .
so what should we do with this puppy ?
let's see .
so this goes up and piston .
and we don't know what that is .
maybe it's the pistons .
i don't know very much about cars .
how many people do you suppose would fit in that size car ?
two .
and there's no engine .
no engine .
mom i can't wait to see what those are .
i know .
they're surprises !
i like surprises .
do you like surprises or no ?
mom .
i wonder if we could make a slide to to go down off the table with this .
but wait .
look at that red thing .
that has something to do with the fact that they're videotaping us i think .
kind of a noisy car don't you think ?
uh-yes .
firstname !
we only have a couple more minutes .
let's finish playing with this one okay ?
okay .
mom .
you think maybe it needs something needs to be oiled ?
it's a squeaky car isn't it ?
what does this say ?
can you read that ?
what's it say ?
b b .
what sound does a e make ?
please read it mom .
you just want me to read it ?
yes .
you sure you don't want to try it ?
mm-no .
it's bendos .
bendos .
that must be the name of the company that makes this toy right ?
funky lights up there .
they don't make too many cars that have lights up there on the top like that do you ?
and there's some here .
some here .
and there's some right there .
yes .
there's two right there .
yes .
and there's two of them right there .
and .
pretty fancy car .
how could you tell it was a race car ?
because race cars have sticky things .
sticky things ?
what about a number ?
what number is that ?
eight .
one eight .
which is .
what number is that ?
first car .
no do you know what number that is ?
one eight ?
eighteen .
after ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen .
right ?
maybe it this way because this car got maded eighteen years ago .
that's a pretty good thought .
but i think race cars they're just they number them so that when they're racing they can keep track of .
they have something to call each car by so that they know who wins .
instead of a name there's a number .
like let's pretend this is a race car and let's pretend another race car .
say ready steady go .
ready set go !
wee !
number eighteen wins !
number thirteen loses .
uh-oh .
well .
somebody can .
not everybody can win when we do a race right ?
but what's the most important thing when you're doing a race ?
that was five minutes .
are you ready to see something else ?
okay let's trade .
i'll take this one .
and you can take this one .
i'll be back in a little bit .
what is that ?
it's a meerkat !
you're so smart !

cool .
this one over here .
you want to help me pull the cover off this one ?
okay .
alright let's pull this off .
there .
you can play with that one for a little while .
let's see what we can do with this ?
what is this ?
well i don't know .
what do you think it is ?
let's see .
what does this look like ?
you know i've never seen anything quite like this one before .
what do you suppose it would be ?
i don't know .
what's that music ?
well something's making those lights flash right ?
so that means that maybe it's some kind of computer or something with a battery in it ?
or maybe .
i wonder .
nope it doesn't have a battery .
it's plugged into the wall .
it's plugged into the wall .
so it's powered by a electrical electricity that's coming through the wall right ?
but how could we play with this ?
did you notice that ?
what ?
when we touched it the lights stopped flashing .
they started again .
that's interesting .
how about that ?
so .
how about that ?
touching these makes it make noise .
mom look .
it seems like .
or maybe it just does it on .
well that's sorta fun .
that sounds like a telephone .
it does sound like a telephone .
you know what this reminds me of ?
what ?
firstname .
who's a robot right ?
when you touch her certain ways there are mechanisms in her body that that let her know that you're touching her a certain way and then she responds a certain way right ?
no .
should we see if it does the same thing every time we do that ?
it doesn't do the same thing every time does it ?
so maybe it's .
maybe it's not because of what i'm doing .
it does respond to touch doesn't it ?
look !
it does the same thing .
interesting i hear .
makes the same sound .
uh-yes .
what is that ?
i don't know .
it's interesting colors .
what colors does it does it show ?
red .
yes .
red .
what else ?
yellow .
uh-yes .
yellow .
yellow .
yellow .
orange orange .
yellow yellow .
green green .
those are almost the same colors on a stop light aren't they ?
i like what it does when you put your hand on the middle part .
now it doesn't do it .
it's doing the same thing .
and making the same noise a lot .
yes .
it's an interesting toy isn't it ?
cool !
see how it lights on top .
to middle and very middle ?
uh-yes .
it's interesting .
i wonder what this is called .
what do you think we should call it ?
should we make up a name for it ?
i know .
what ?
colorful does when you touch .
what ?
colorful does when you touch .
colorful does when you touch ?
that's a good name .
because when you touch it it makes color .
right that's a great that's a perfect name .
it exactly describes what it does .
but i wonder what it's really called .
i would like to know that too .
that's a good question .
ha !
see ?
yes .
sparkle sparkle !
does that remind you of anything ?
that's cool .
i didn't see it do that yet .
what does it remind you of ?
this reminds me of colorful rainbows .
in the sky .
mom !
what ?
look !
you see how there's those two things on each side of the room ?
you know what those are ?
what ?
those are called microphones .
why are there microphones hanging here ?
so that they can hear our voices .
they record what we're saying .
hi .
hi !
did you like this one ?
but what is it called ?
well we could talk about it at at the end .
remember when we're going to chat about these things ?
but right now i'm ready for the next one .
okay .
first i'll cover this one up .
we have lots of questions about that one .
that one was pretty exciting .
that was pretty interesting wasn't it ?
okay well i'm going to be right back with the next one .
okay .
tell me what that one is .
you like surprises don't you ?
is she here yet ?
not yet .
what ?
it's fun to take you to these studies did you know that ?
uh-yes .
okay .
here's this one !
boy !
cool !
now what does that remind you of ?
what ?
does it remind you of anything ?
what ?
firstname !
it's a robot !
look !
it's walking towards you !
what what do you suppose will hap .
look it knew .
it's turning so it doesn't run into you !
that's pretty amazing .
so do you suppose it can sense when it gets close to something ?
what is it ?
i don't know .
what kind of animal do you think it is ?
it's a dog .
it's a robot dog .
hello robot dog .
you know i see some more buttons on that thing .
where ?
there's one on his forehead .
would you like to see what happens when you press the button on his forehead ?
looks like it goes to sleep after a while if it doesn't have anybody to touch it .
on the back .
hello puppy !
are you coming to see me ?
i'm curious to see if it'll stop when it starts to run into me .
look at that !
it knows how to turn .
that's pretty cool !
this would be a fun toy to have at home wouldn't it ?
let's see if we can find anything else to press on it .
let's see you pressed this one and then you pressed this one .
there's something there makes it wag it's tail .
that's a funny looking tail !
fell asleep on me .
wake up !
hello .
it's peeing !
that's what it looks like isn't it ?
so now what should we do with it ?
it's not very soft for a puppy is it ?
uh-no .
touch my foot .
sleeping .
you made it lay down !
that's my arm .
where are you going ?
this would be a fun toy to have wouldn't it ?
are you coming to see me puppy ?
want it on your lap ?
his eyes are red now .
i was noticing his eyes were green before .
i wonder what that means .
do you think maybe that means it's excited ?
go get her puppy !
are you going to put it in my lap again ?
are you all done ?
i think he's sleeping .
he's peeing .
so does it sit down every time we press that button ?
yep .
that makes it sit down and it goes like this .
open its mouth up like it's talking .
arf arf .
let me see what happens when you do this again ?
wags its tail .
shakes its head .
those are the only three buttons i see do you see any .
wait !
hah !
something in the ear ?
walking backwards !
now it's eyes are green again .
what do you suppose that means ?
i don't know .
it means i guess it means excited and not .
maybe .
you know what does .
now they're red .
now they're green .
how do you suppose this thing goes ?
what do you suppose makes the the robot go ?
but i mean what gives it the power to go do you think ?
batteries .
i think you're probably right .
do you think its .
hi .
hi .
what do you think about this one ?
pretty cool .
what is it called ?
well like i told you before we'll have a chance to talk about all of these when we're all done okay ?
can you give me that one and i'll bring another one in ?
thank you .
you were ready for the trade ?
that was pretty cool !
that was cool !
this is kinda fun .
get to try all kinds of new toys ?
okay .
are your eyes closed ?
here's the next one !
okay you can open them .
boy !
there you go .
you can play with that one .
look !
just keep the cage closed .
how do you play with it ?
well we can talk to it .
hi little mousey !
is it a mouse ?
you know i think maybe it's a very big gerbil but i'm not sure because i've never seen a gerbil that big before .
gerbil !
what was that ?
it sounds like a cat !
it did sound like a cat .
look !
the whiskers .
i have an idea .
maybe the next toy that we are going to play with is something like a cat .
we'll have to wait and see .
let's focus on this one because we only have five minutes .
and he sure is cute isn't he ?
should we try talking to it and see what it does ?
hello !
squeak squeak !
hello !
you are really curious about who we are aren't you ?
good thing he's in a cage !
i wonder what kind of an animal .
i don't think it's a gerbil .
i don't know what it is though it's awfully big .
it has gold teeth .
i noticed that .
that was interesting wasn't it ?
gerbils don't have gold teeth .
maybe it's a .
i don't know what it is .
maybe it's a kind of mouse .
you know i've never seen a mouse that big either but we'll have to ask when we're when question time is at the very end after all the toys ?
look !
geez !
he can stand on two feet !
i saw that !
do you suppose he's wondering why he's in this room with us ?
and not in the .
in the place he's usually in ?
look at the whiskers going .
know what he's doing ?
what ?
snifsting .
sniffing .
and do you know why ?
why ?
because some animals learn about their environment by smell .
so he's trying to get some clues as to what's going on by smelling .
his tail looks dirty .
it's a good thing he's in a cage .
i in fact i bet you he's more curious about us than we are about him .
you think ?
i think so .
should we give him a name ?
what should we name .
how about degu ?
degu ?
hello degu !
we can call him degu because he's curious .
he's awfully cute isn't he ?
he's so cute .
mee !
he does have gold teeth .
that's really interesting .
look at how busy his nose is .
and look at all his whiskers .
he's cute !
he's so cute .
yes .
mom .
there's lots of stuff that he can eat .
like that .
well you know i don't think that's all food honey .
i think it's something for him to walk on .
it's it's like cat litter kinda .
well not exactly .
looks like he's getting kind of excited ?
trying to figure out what in the world is going on .
do you remember the gerbils that we used to go see sometimes at at the pet store ?
the gerbils and hamsters and mice ?
at pet supplies plus ?
he's leaning back .
look at him !
it looks like he's going to do a back flip !
i wonder if you're ticklish .
but i don't even think we should put our fingers through the holes because we don't know if he bites right ?
he's so cute !
he is very cute .
look at his little feet .
they're so .
how many toes does he have ?
look !
i only see three .
four .
four .
four toes ?
wait no .
one two three four five .
he has five ?
okay .
he has as much toes as we do .
that's kinda interesting .
even in the back feet ?
one .
kinda hard to count when he's moving all over the place isn't it ?
he has two ears .
he has gold teeth .
but he has like two or three teeth on the top and the bottom .
that you can see they might be some more farther back ?
kinda has big ears .
i don't think that's a gerbil .
i think it's too big for a gerbil .
and i don't think it's a mouse .
and .
i don't think it's .
but it's some kind of rodent .
a rodent is a mammal .
it hasta be .
small mammal .
it hasta be some kind of animal .
well we know that don't we ?
so when it's question time we'll have to ask firstname- firstname what it is ?
his his but nose don't bite .
no but he does have a mouth with sharp teeth so i don't think i'd want to stick my finger in there .
i wish i knew a thing about him .
okay .
ready for the very last one ?
okay .
i bet you can't guess what the last one is can you ?
is there one more surprise you haven't seen yet ?
what was what was the meow thing ?
you know what ?
we have a squeaky door .
one of the doors squeaks .
it sounds like a cat !
the other family in before you thought that too .
i thought there might be a kitten in next time and i thought surely she would have asked about allergies before they did that .
no .
sorry !
okay .
nope no kittens but there is this one .
want to help me uncover this one again ?
without tripping .
right there .
there we go .
what is it ?
well you can look and see .
how do we play with this one ?
let's see what we can figure out ?
look !
do you see anything moving ?
what ?
what is it ?
i don't know .
come over here you can see it from this angle better .
what .
look it's some kind of sea creature .
i think it's a octopus .
it kinda looks like an octopus doesn't it ?
i think that there's only one creature in there .
i only see one .
do you only see one ?
well let's just watch it and see what it does .
what does it do ?
it's just moving around a little bit .
can you see ?
it's just moving its tentacles .
yes .
but look there's little hairs all over it .
see all the hairs ?
octopus don't have those .
i don't think so .
it'd be awfully small to be an octopus too .
yes .
i have lots of questions about this .
i see something else that's moving too .
what ?
you know i think maybe if you look around here you can see some more moving things in there .
see in there ?
the wavy things ?
i wonder what those are .
what if we knock on the cage ?
you know i don't know if i would want to do that because that might be stressful for whatever that is in there .
i can't even tell what it is .
is this the last one ?
this is the last one .
i wish it would come out .
i see something down there at the bottom .
that one leg or one tentacle or whatever down there ?
is that that blue thing ?
it's okay .
come here .
it's between the two rocks see ?
between the two rocks do you see it down there ?
i only see three .
it's cracked .
see that one's cracked .
yes .
what do you suppose it is ?
i don't know what it is .
i don't see any head or body all i see is tentacles .
do you think it's a sea anemone ?
i don't know .
i think we're going to have lots of questions for firstname .
what do you think ?
yes .
looks like it likes to be right by that rock and part way under that rock doesn't it ?
i think it's just that it's shy is what it is .
i think it likes it more in deeper water .
you think ?
mom .
what ?
if i was in that water my head would be up there .
it would be .
you wouldn't fit in there would you ?
no .
my both knees would be breaking the glass .
it's moving its .
it's looks like it's moving around a little .
maybe we should stay and watch it for a little while sweetie .
let's see what it does .
kinda blue-ish isn't it ?
i wonder what that is .
i don't know what is it but i'm really curious about it .
i mean i wonder if it eats that little pink thing that's over there .
you know ?
because every creature needs to eat something right ?
mom look at those bubbles .
air bubbles i guess .
you know who we know who has an aquarium with fish in it ?
what ?
firstname .
remember firstname's house ?
yes .
they had an aquarium with fish .
it's swimming it's interesting .
it's interesting looking .
it's very interesting .
my gosh .
i wonder if that is a light .
or a heater there ?
i wonder if it's a heater when it grows cold in the water .
here .
let me show you something .
see ?
it looks like that's a water filter that's putting clean water in there or something .
see that ?
how the water's coming in from that machine here ?
and we have a light and it's right there .
see ?
that blue light ?
i bet that kind of light is a special kind of light that probably that creature likes .
i don't know .
i don't know very much about that kind of sea creature .
me either !
and it looks like a pretty unusual one so .
i bet a lot of people are curious about it .
i'm so curious !
being curious is a good thing isn't it ?
hello .
what is this ?
well now it's time to talk about those things .
alright .
well i wanted to know .
we were wondering about what was that ?
you were wondering about that ?
well let's look at my pictures and talk about some of the things before i tell you okay ?
but i will answer your questions .
how about you sit in this green chair ?
and .
well , here's the first one .
what is that ?
you guys play with this one for five minutes , and i'll come back in with something new .
what is that ?
it's a hamster .
a hamster ?

where does she keep it ?
he's scared .
what do you think this thing is ?
a hamster .
at firstname's house .
do you think he has a name ?
no , firstname's had an ugly tail , remember ?
this one doesn't have that horrible tail .
, because it's furry .
yes .
yes .
what do you think , you think it's a boy or a girl ?
i think it's a girl .

yuck .
they need to clean the cage .
what do you think it eats ?
, i don't know .
alright mom ?

it looks like it likes to tear up that thing .
watch , those little shreds all over the place ?
it likes to make a mess .
i'm touching it .
did it hurt ?
no .
it didn't .
i want to touch its fur .
me too .
let's open it .
well they got it taped down .
i don't think you're supposed to open it .
i wonder what that thing is .
what could that be for ?
maybe probably for the water bottle .
maybe you're supposed to hold it so it won't fall .
so they've gotta drink water , right ?
yes .
maybe it doesn't want to .
or do you think it drinks pop .
or coffee .
or beer !
do you think it drinks beer ?

five-years old .
five-years old ?

they're yellow .
then you should take this off and brush her teeth .
it's .
i didn't bring a toothbrush .
it's taped .
did you bring one ?
number one .

okay .
alright .
so here are the triceratops home .
and now they're meeting each other .
they seem like they're getting along pretty well .
hi my name is joe .
my name is joe too .
they're both named joe .
i can't believe it .
amazing .
okay .
everything going well over there ?
yes .
except last night they kept me up .
i don't know why i thought they were happy .
with .
the trees .
with .
having .
you know a nice place to sleep .
but they were so loud .
the neighbors complained .
what would you recommend ?
well that's mostly all i can i thought they were really going to be hap .
be happy there .
you thought that what ?
that's all they really need .
so why were they loud ?
just some dinosaurs are .
so maybe i should get a different kind of pet .
what other kind of pet .
that's the only kind of thing we sell .
really .
well how do other people deal with the noise ?
they don't .
the noise doesn't bother them ?
no .
do you think i should move maybe ?
just leave the triceratops here ?
no no .
take them with me and we'll move out to the country where there's no people living by us so we won't bother anybody .
sure .
you can do that .
okay .
do you sell houses ?
what ?
do you sell new houses ?
no but there is somebody .
somebody right next to us over there that .
where you can ask for a house .
okay because i think that would be good because my neighbors are really angry .
and they were just loud all night long .
but you're right .
that's just how dinosaurs are .
do you sell .
do you sell things to cover their mouths .
so they don't roar ?
all i got is .
water bottles and .
chocolate milk bottles .
okay okay .
so like this .
will this help ?
is that how i should do it .
and tie them on .
will that keep them quiet ?
hum .
that doesn't fit at all .
hum .
maybe we could .
can he go in .
will it help if his mouth is inside this ?
no .
it seems hopeless .
i think i'm going to have to move to the country .
i think that's a better idea .
because they're just going to be loud i think .
momma .
do you think i can have all this money .
no you can't have all this money .
in fact i'm regretting that i let you use it because now you keep thinking about it .
i'll tell you what .
you may have two quarters .

here .
no , see , that's a whole word right there that'd be too big .

there's storm .
okay there's one more with five letters .
what does it say ?
that's teens .

when i press this that means it's time for the next page .
okay ?
okay .
do you know how to read yet ?
no .
i'm still working on bob books .
okay .
alright .
now we're going to look at these ones .
so we're going to look at the picture .
and then you're going to tell me how you would do it .
so what this boy doing ?
he's brushing his teeth .
do you know how to brush your teeth ?
i i pick up my brush .
then i put on the toothpaste .
and then i put the toothpaste underwater .
and then .
when it's time for me to brush i press a bird button on it .
and then it makes sound .
and it turns on .
and then jee .
and mostly i brush my tongue .
when do you brush your teeth ?
right after i put on my pajamas .
but sometimes if i'm running late i ss accidentally forget my pajamas .
and i go to the bathroom naked .
and then i have to wait for picking out books .
and then i run even more late picking out the books .
because i have to put on my pj's .
next !
oo !
washing the hands .
after i go to the bathroom i turn it on cold .
and i squirt and squirt like twent like twenty six times .
and some of the soap even squirts onto the floor .
and then i turn it on cold .
and i scrub .
and then i put it under the water .
and i wash it out .
but then .
i i forget where my .
instead of me getting the towel that we use to dry my hands .
i i don't know how to put it back up .
so .
and my mom and dad are working every day .
so i just shake .
and water flies everywhere .
and every time ten drops fall onto my brother's head while i'm upstairs shaking .
really ?
well he's on .
i bet he doesn't like that very much .
well he's on .
the computer .
and he thinks there's a .
and every time he thinks there's a leak in the ceiling .
and it's raining .
that's funny .
what about this one ?
tying shoes .
well i don't know how to tie my shoes yet .
so i always use my mom for help .
but i know how to untie them .
i pull one straight string .
and then the other straight string .
and then i just do the rr .
and then i just untie the rest .
and when i neeneed help untying my shoes .
i mean tying my shoes .
i ask my mom for help .
she crisscrosses them and does some other stuff .
but i know there's little bunny ears in it .
sometimes when i do the bunny ears when i get to the bunny ear part .
i just put my shoe on my head .
and then pretend i'm a bunny .
that's funny .
cereal !
she's getting her breakfast .
how do you pour your cereal ?
well that's easy .
i get a bowl from my cabinet .
and we have little cereal machine thingies .
and when one of them are empty we open the big lid .
and then we pour the cereal into the container .
and then we close the big lid .
and when .
and once you choose which cereal you want you put it under the machine .
you open a little cap .
and you just twist something .
and then there's little shovels that pour that scoop the cereal .
and then pour it into the bowl .
so th .
what's your favorite cereal ?
my favorite one is .
i'm going to think .
tiger flakes .
i call them tiger flakes .
because there's a tiger on the front of the box .
and i got buzz lightyear tiger flakes .
really ?
that's pretty cool .
i like calling them tiger flakes a lot .
that's funny .
ss .
when i was in las vegas i forget they were frosted flakes .
and at all .
and when i had .
and every time i went down for breakfast .
i said i want two bags of ss tiger flakes .
and then i grabbed two .
and then i just poured it in a tiny bowl .
and a .
and a carton of milk .
and i poured it in .
and i got a spoon .
and when i let the tiger flakes soak and get all wet and soggy i like it .
because then it's not too hard to crunch .
and i like it when .
and somehow it just tastes better when it's soggy and .
i agree .
it's a lot better that way .
floppy .
what's this boy doing ?
hehe .
putting on hockey gloves it looks like .
my brother goes to hockey .
really ?
but he .
it's not hockey season now .
so my brother usually just plays with his friends all day .
as long as we don't have to go anywhere .
when you get dressed in the morning like how do you pick out your clothes ?
what do you pick out first ?
i always pick out my panties .
and then i pick out my shorts and tee shirt .
but most of the time i pick out dresses .
that's pretty cool .
do you have a favorite outfit ?
what's your favorite ?
dresses .
i hh .
and he bought me a dress that had a unicorn on it .
that's pretty cool .
and i wear that dress almost every day .
and i wear some beautiful pants .
really ?
it has so many different colors .
it's purple pink and blue .
and indigo .
that's cool .
and some violet .
oo she .
what's she doing ?
she's making cupcakes .
have you ever done that ?
my mom's helped me once .
how'd you guys do it ?
i forget .
because that was a long time ago when we made them .
we made them for a party .
okay .
and .
today there's a baby shower coming .
really ?
yep .
that's exciting .
and if anyone crawls into my bedroom i will somehow have to get them out .
because i don't really like anyone in my room .
because it's where i like to be alone .
because most of the time when i'm upset or anything i run into my room .
but when i'm really mad i just slam the door .
and then i run .
and then i forget my bed's there .
because i close my eyes .
and i trip onto my bed .
no .
and then i and i .
and once i fall into my squishy soft bed i i close my eyes .
and my face is right on the blanket .
and i was doing this .
and i was kicking my own feet into a soft blanket .
but then i slipped off the bed and ff slipped right into my princess tent i got for my birthday .
that sounds really cool .
let me do the buzzer things to tell you when to do it .
okay .
tell you .
so the beh this will tell you when to turn that .
painting .
i love painting .
once i made a picture of at of people being at the beach .
but i used way too much sand .
so .
and then i weh .
and then my .
and then my whole picture turned outed to be people get people getting washed away into the ocean .
no !
instead of them relaxing in the sand .
that's cool .
and every day i would go into the .
water .
and well .
my mom would help me jump over the humongous waves that were coming .
but ev somehow every time i sneak off while my mom is relaxing in the sun sunbathing .
and i run into the water .
and i try to swim under .
but then i forget to swim under .
because i can't get deep enough .
and i also forget .
and i end up with salt water in my mouth .
no .
that's the worst .
but now the salt's out .
because of the doctor .
the doctor helped me .
that's good .
but once when i had an infection in my ih right here in my elbow .
see that little hole in there ?
there used to be a a white bump about this size .
when i bumped it .
really ?
at school .
because i was playing on the playground .
then someone bumped into me .
and i fell rr .
and my elbow .
just hit the side of something .
and i don't know .
what happened .
so i went to the doctor .
but the doctor had to do something that would that hurt me .
a little bit .
but i .
but it was so bad i cried the whole way home .
that's no fun .
because they .
i'm glad you're better now .
they had to get tweezers or something that would that's strong that you can pull with .
and they had to tweeze onto the bump .
and then pull it out .
and all left was a little bump .
but i bleeded a little bit .
but then .
but then it was fine .
i'm glad you're okay .
do .
oo .
do you want to look at the next picture ?
alright .
oo !
car seat !
looks like he's buckling .
do you know how to buckle your seat belt ?
how do you do it ?
i get .
i grab my buckle .
i pull out the string a little bit .
and then i find where the buckle place is .
and then i use all my strength .
and then push it down .
and then i'm ready to go !
awesome .
but sometimes i .
forget that i have to buckle myself now .
because i'm old enough .
oo .
what's she doing ?
she's playing with her teddy bear .
how do you do that ?
do you feed your bears ?
i don't have any teddy bears .
but i used to .
did you feed them ?
it was ff .
it was for christmas .
okay .
my christmas in tennessee .
i got it in a stocking .
and we ww just digged in into our stockings .
and we got a lot of candy .
really ?
we got a giant lollipop .
mine was a a huge egg .
my my brother's was a huge a bunny .
that's cool .
but for some reason we didn't know why it was a bunny .
because it was saint nick .
not the easter bunny .
we didn't know why .
so .
it's weird .
and i started to feed my unicorn .
what'd you feed your unicorn ?
i feeded her some yummy grass soup .
grass soup .
i've never heard of that .
unicorns love soup .
just like some grass she they love .
okay .
she loves it more than anything .
really ?
she wouldn't give grass up for the world !
she wouldn't give a wor .
she wouldn't trade anything for her huge hill of grass .
but there's a lot .
every day when i wake up and .
in the morning i feel like bees are covering our house and ffflying us to the bee queen .
no .
that's scary .
and i was .
and i it was actually all a dream .
okay .
that makes sense .
do you want to look at the next one ?
alrightie .
what's he doing ?
i don't know .
well it looks like he's got some silly costumes on .
maybe he's dressing up .
maybe for halloween .
what were you for halloween this year ?
i was a bat .
really ?
because i have a bat hoodie .
that's cool .
when i pull up the hoodie there is .
i i when i pull it up there's little bat ears on it .
and sometimes my brother doesn't let me use his fake vampire ears .
or teeth .
haha .
but .
i don't need his ears now .
but i do need his teeth .
but he does share sometimes .
that's good .
and this year i'm gon .
i'm gon for halloween i'm going to be the demon .
oo .
a demon .
that's scary .
but it's not like a monster demon .
it's just a .
like a person that has makeup on his face .
but his name is the demond .
okay .
i gotcha .
it's a person from a band named kiss .
oo that's cool .
and i ll .
and i love rock and roll music now so .
and they're the best band ever .
because they play the best rock and roll .
so ever almost every day when we don't have stuff to do i just turn on kiss .
and then i have a huge party in my bedroom .
and i open my door .
so my mom and brother and dad can hear .
and they're like .
sounds like fun .
and they are just .
partying up to my room to have a dance party .
bow !
alright what are they doing ?
playing at a playground on a slide .
how do you do that ?
i just climb up a ladder .
and when i'm at the park i just vv .
sometimes when i'm scared i just try to grab on to the sides .
and i ss .
and i scoot my feet .
so then i stop .
but when other people come and it gets more weight and more weight my scooting stops .
and then i just get pushed down .
by the other kids .
alright what's he doing ?
let's look at this picture .
soccer !
how do you play soccer ?
i don't play soccer .
if you did play soccer how would you play it ?
i don't know .
because i don't know anything about sports .
what ?
do you play any sports ?
no .
what's your favorite thing to do outside ?
do you have a favorite ?
i look before i cross the street .
and i just run .
to the other side before another car comes .
so then i walk up her stairs .
and then i ring the doorbell .
and i wait for her .
but when she says she can't play i just go back to being bored .
but once i think of something to do i just do it .
but if i realize i can't do it i'll ask my mom and dad or brother to play .
but whenever my brother and .
my brother's friends are in the hammock we have in our backyard well .
i love to swing them .
there's one ride called the blue death where you hang on to this side .
but you sit .
like this instead of doing this .
so you grab on to the back side .
and then i start swinging you like crazy .
and sometimes i even make you flip upside down .
and then right side up again .
woah .
that's pretty crazy .
yep .
this .
is it fun ?
it's really fun .
do you want to look at the next picture ?
let me think .
listen to the buzzer .
what are they doing ?
playing with blocks .
how do you play with blocks ?
i don't have blocks .
so i don't know how i would .
do you have legos ?
i do have some things that i can use as blocks .
i can stack them one by one .
i call them bananagrams .
because that's what they are .
that's cool .
but but they're big boxes .
but they're actually magnets .
magna tiles .
that's cool .
is what their real name should be .
and that is what the box said they are .
but i call them bananagrams .
i'm thinking of what i should do .
you really got them all that time .
they're singing together !
there's only a couple more pictures left .
how long until i can go to my daddy .
and brother ?
and how long have they been out there ?
it's .
i don't know .
i think it's been about like thirty minutes .
here let why don't you pick your last favorite picture out of this group .

i love this picture .
because i've always wanted to explore space .

i want to keep looking .
okay .

they were the yummiest apples i've ever tasted .

hehheh !
oo i love tigers !
they're so cool .

alright this is the last picture !
ice cream and a seagull .
i love ice cream and seagulls .
i love to .
i love chasing birds .
i've always wanted to catch one .
but i've never been able to .
because the birds are too quick .
and they always know i'm coming .
somehow .
and my mom won't let me .
because she hates birds .
because when she was little .
birds would come out into the window every time it was open .
and they would rip a hole through the little black lines .
and they would come in the house .
and poop on mom .
no .
and peck all over her .
so that's why she hates birds .

beautiful job .
hit another buzzer .
that was easy peasy for you .
after you guys were going to add fish .
because like fish you don't add the s because that's a lot of fish instead of fishes .
it is a fun one to say .
okay, i'm just going to press this one now .
okay .
great job .
alright .
now no help on this one .
i just want you to tell me everything you see in this picture .
boat .
lion .
fish .
lily pads .
plants .
mosquito .
dragon fly .
grass .
water .
i don't know what this is .
is that just another lily pad ?
that's a good guess .
i think .
we can just let him figure it out .
okay ?
is that a floating orange ?
that's a good idea .
i need a clue .
well just tell me what you think .
and we'll just keep talking about it .
this is all about your ideas .
guys so so for this one i do need him to just .
okay .
think of things on his own .
okay ?
you can just describe it .
you don't have to name it .
what do you think it looks like ?
a lily pad ?
that's a great idea .
what do you think is going on in this picture ?
what's happening ?
a lion and a boy is on a boat .
and there's fish .
and there's leaves .
and there's lily pad .
is that normal ?
does that happen a lot ?
or how do you think they got here ?
boat .
aylan think i .
what else do i need to do now ?
what else do i need to ?
what's happening .
bugs are flying .
fish, fish are swimming .
there's a flower in the ss in the lake .
what do you think had to happen for the boy to get in a boat with a lion ?
maybe the lion is his pet ?
would you have a lion as a pet ?
no .
why not ?
i don't want a lion .
i want a dog .
you want a dog .
that's better than a lion ?
okay so if the lion's his pet, where do you think they're going in the boat ?
to the zoo .
is he going to drop his pet off at the zoo ?
is that kinda sad ?
but maybe that's not his pet .
and he's bringing it to the zoo .
that makes sense .
okay .
so how does the boy have this boat ?
maybe his dad bought it .
that's a good idea .
any other ideas or things you want to tell me about this picture ?
alright we can go to the next one .
can you tell me everything you see ?
i see cars, a sock, and another boy, fish, a paper airplane, a plane, clouds, a bed, pillows, and a costume .
and a drawer .
and more fish .
and toy cars .
and a sock .
and a pillow .
and a window .
that's all i could see .
so who is this guy ?
and what's he doing ?
that's just the same guy on the boat .
okay .
what's he doing now ?
he's wearing a costume and pretending he's a pilot i think .
have you ever played pretend before ?
what do you like to pretend to be ?
i forgot .
what ?

no worries .
what do you think the rats are doing in the lab ?
or the doctor stuff .
maybe they're maybe they're getting ready for someone to come .

okay .
so they're trying to get this room .
whatever it is .
ready for someone ?
gotcha .
okay .
anything else about this picture ?
doesn't look like it .
alright .
then we'll go to this one .
what's hap ?
what is this ?
it looks like it's another farm .
what's on the farm ?
it looks like radishes .
and and .
i could not see what else .
well it kind of looks like these are shells .
here .
so what animal might it be that has a shell like that ?
it's a snail .
i i thought it was something from a beach that they took home .
okay .
and .
so what are snails doing on a farm ?
maybe they just come here .
maybe because it's hot out there .
and and .
okay .
and maybe plants are growing that they want to sneak and hide from .
so who's working on the farm ?
it looks like that someone just drove it there to help the farmer .
okay .
who who is this ?
it's a girl .
and what is she doing ?
helping pick up some stuff out of the way ?
maybe ?
is this a normal sized radish do you think ?
no .
because it's bigger than her .
it is so big right ?
right .
so what do you think happened ?
or what is she going to do with it ?
maybe .
maybe they have a trailer and put it back in their trailer .
that they brung .
there's never going to be a rr a real radish that big .
unless they put a lot of water on there .
so what would what would what could she do with a radish that big ?
maybe .
may maybe they need to cut it it some of it down .
because because it's so big .
and make it be they could have half of it .
okay .
and what would ?
it's it's .
they do with the other half ?
maybe they just could cut it and cut it and cut it .
so it's it depends how big their family is .
okay .
so they're going to share it with their family ?
one person could have one piece .
one person could have one piece .
one person could have one piece .
i think that's a great idea .

yes .
yes ?
would you take her serum that she's making ?

rats and .
and that one's a mouse .
why is there a rat and a mouse in the lab ?
it's because she must be doing a a thing on them earlier .

since she did a serum on them already she's going to make a new one and decide which animal she wants to be .
