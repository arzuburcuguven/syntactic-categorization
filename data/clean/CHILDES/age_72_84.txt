because why ?
because he ate !
all that .
it's too much .
the next day was sunday again .
and he ate through a nice green leaf .
and after that he felt much better .
now he wasn't hungry anymore .
and he wasn't little anymore .
he was a big .
fat !
caterpillar .
he built a small house .
called it a cocoon .
around himself .
he stayed inside for more than two weeks .
then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon .
and he pushed his way out .
and guess what he turned into ?
butterfly .
a beautiful butterfly !
were we talking about caterpillars ?
i want to go see mine .
show inv your caterpillar ?
that's right that fuzzy one .
we don't know if it's a caterpillar or a gypsy moth .
i know .
so if you pick it up and it bites .
it's a gypsy moth .
but we don't want to .
no i don't .
i woke !
him up .
you woke him up ?
that feels fuzzy !
i hate that feeling .
alright .
how about you want to look at this book now ?
looked out the window .
great ?
do you want to read it to me ?
okay .
not real fast now .
so i can see .
he looked out the window .
a little louder .
went into the kitchen .
climbed into the toy box .
and the moon shining .
and .
he .
got into the box and rode away .
with the owl !
then they sat the moon and set up the food .
they took .
lots of spoons and they ate on top of the moon .
owl went to the sky .
what happened ?
and it started .
raining and thunder and lightning .
the bear put his hat on .
and then .
came up the chimney .
he got all rusty !
he came up from the box and .
he was messy !
his mother cleaned him off .
and he woke up the morning .
nice and clean .
i think i like that story better than the .
the words that are in it .
this is cute book .
that's great .
the pictures are nice .
read another one .
can you look at this one ?
you want to read it ?
i looked at it .
don't you want to read it ?
or do you want me to read it ?
don't read so fast though .
why don't you read it .
elephant !
right .
elephants are free .
a little louder .
free ?
i .
don't want to read this book .
you want me to read it ?
okay ?
start at the beginning .
elephants are the largest animals .
this baby looks little besides its mother .
but when it was born it weighed two hundred pounds .
and it was three feet tall .
i don't want to read that book .
why ?
okay =?
who cares .
why ?
we're almost done .
sit up and listen to the story .
okay ?
it was three feet tall .
it grew inside its mother for over one year and ten months .
more than a year longer than a human baby needs to grow inside his mother .
a baby elephant is called a calf .
a mother elephant gives birth to one calf at a time .
she will not give birth again until her calf is three years old .
a baby elephant may drink mother's milk until it is four or five years old .
it curls back its trunk when it's feeding .
there's two kinds of elephants .
asian and african .
this is a female asian elephant .
they are not as tall as african cousins .
they have smaller ears and smaller tusks .
the female .
called a cow .
has no tusks at all .
this is an african elephant .
male elephants are called bulls .
did you know that ?
african elephants have a dip in their backs .
they have ridges on their trunks .
which end in two points .
asian elephants have smoother trunks that end in just one point .
the elephant's nearest living relative is a small furry creature called a hyrax .
they live in holes in africa .
they don't look much like elephants .
but their feet are like elephants' feet .
only much smaller .
are you listening ?
i don't want that .
another .
why ?
momma hasta .
another close relative of the elephant is the sea cow .
this sea cow is called a manatee .
sea cows are shy .
they never leave the water .
their skin and teeth are like elephant's .
some sea cows have small tusks .
that's too long mom .
it's too long ?
you're not interested in the story ?
want to read a little bit ?
no ?
can i finish this one ?
and then i can do this study ?
asian elephants live in forests and swamps .
this cow lives in nepal .
a small country north of indian india .
you can see her small ears and her small tusks .
african elephants live in the plains as well as the forests .
this african elephant lives in the open grassland .
he flaps his big ears to help keep cool in the hot weather .
elephants do not eat meat .
they eat grass leaves fruit and bark .
as much as two hundred and fifty pounds a day .
they use their trunks to reach high branches .
tear up plants .
and strip the bark off the trees .
she read this book ?
is this the same book ?
no but i already remember her book .
what's this elephant doing ?
bet you don't know what he's doing .
digging =?
eating ?
digging =?
eating ?
you know what he's digging for ?
bones ?
salt .
what is salt ?
they use their tusks to dig for salt .
and they dig holes in their .
dry rivers to find water .
there's water over there .
and if they .
dig deep down they can get a drink .
come on we're almost done .
i don't want to read .
almost done .
elephants drink a large amount of water .
can you guess how many gallons a day he would drink ?
one hundred ?
fifty gallons .
they drink up quarts of water into their trunks at a time then they squirt the water down their throats .
they bathe by squirting the water from their trunks all over their bodies .
look at them taking a bath .
they love to take baths .
they're good swimmers they like to splash around in the water .
because they drink so much and enjoy swimming elephants needta live water .
a lot of water ?
they're bothered by flies and bugs .
they get rid of them by taking mud baths .
this group of elephants looks red .
they look red because they have been rolling around in red mud .
they live and travel in big groups called herds .
the herd may be a few animals or a few hundred .
most of the time elephants are peaceful animals .
and they only charge when they are threatened .
but elephants get very excitable and angry for a few weeks or months .
once a year .
this is called being in musth .
zoo elephants must be kept by themselves during .
musth .
i didn't know that .
i know ?
look .
elephants are very smart animals .
there are schools for asian elephants .
they go to school .
they're taught to drag piles of logs and load them into the trucks .
elephants carry people .
like the men with their bundles of grass .
these asian elephants are being rounded up to be trained for work .
i didn't know that .
african elephants are not as easy to train .
often they are killed for their ivory tusks .
even though this is against the law .
elephants deserve better treatment than this .
that's kind of sad ?
that they would kill them to take their tusks ?
that has a lot of words doesn't it .
i think she was kind of bored with that .
none of the kids really .

that .
that the democrats can look at .
reagan later as president and say you won !
it's true .
but you didn't win win that !
well .
there are a lot of people out there who don't !
like what you're doing .
and you have to tame it down .
you gotta .
right .
you gotta do what we tell you .
we're trying to represent the people .
and we're trying to tell you what the people out there want .
now reagan won't listen if he wins too .
right .
well .
too easily .
but if .
he's given a little bit of a .
right .
run for it .
i'd say .
also mon mondale still has a chance but it's it's a very very slim chance .
pretty slim .
it's pretty slim .
i'm not voting for mondale .
it certainly !
would be interesting if he won .
i'm not voting for mondale .
right it would be a it would be a real real .
who you voting for mark ?

not voting for reagan .

snow might be two inches high ?
yes .

deep .
she said it .

you can say high sometimes but you never say tall .
why not ?
because only a person is tall .
or a building .
something that is very thin .
something that lays flat !
like grass !
you can say grass is getting tall .
or you can say you can say the grass is getting tall .
i'm not flat .

i'm not flat .
you could say the grass is getting high you can't say the grass is tall !
unless it's really !
thin grass .
yes you do !

thin grass .
then it's tall .
like you have to thin tall grass ?

marco polo .
right ?
yes .
but what's the name of the program ?
mark !
beats me .

i meant .

that'what's on television very pretty .
ross .
is it hard being a first grader ?
yes .
but it's harder being a second !
one .
i know the .
between of dogs and cats .
dogs chase .
cats but cats don't chase dogs .
and is that the between ?
that's the difference !
between .

yes .
what are you saying ?
i'm just saying that from now on the daddy's get the spankings .
i just wanted to tell you that a .
dog and a puppy are between each other .
and a cat and a kitten are between each other .
it's a wet wet day .
it's not possible .
yes it is too possible .
it's not !
possible .
it's as not possible as a cat can be a friend with a mouse .
well maybe they haven't been paying attention to what he did .
right ?
like for example what ross ?
can't really say .
like .
reagan ats a says .
that the starving people .
in africa and things have to have to work !
can't have have to .
yes .
for money .
and .
mondale says why not just give .
the food to !
them .
right .
and .
what about war ?
which one wants war ?
ronald .
ronny ronny wants he says ".
we'll stand up to the russians we'll bomb them good .
you know one time he said .
that .
he w that he would he made a joke and he said ".
i'm sending the missles now .
not funny .
not a very funny joke was it ?
a lot of people freaked out ro ross .
a lot of .
rather important !
people .
like who ?
the russians weren't very happy .
the russians were not real pleased .
how would you like it if somebody destroyed your whole country ?
how would you like it if somebody made fun of something that important ?
remember what the emperor did to alderon ?
yes .
do you think we should do that ?
that's how it .
goes ?
yes .
like that ?
yes .
but !
there's an important problem .
what ?
how to link them together .
let's try .
you stick them .
together like that .
but that won't work because then they won't .
well who knows the differences between .
reagan and mondale ?
we do .
okay what are the differences ?
mondale .
says .
it's free lunch time .
and reagan says you have to pay .
mondale says you can have a free lunch ?
and and reagan says you have to pay ?
yes .
do you think there's any free !
lunch ?
well with mondale !
well ross .
there are lunches at your school aren't there ?
but they're never free .
ronald re because all !
most of the people in the school voted for .
ronald reagan .
in our !
class .
yes .
did they ?
that's why there weren't any free .
lunches .
well it serves them right right ?
yes .
poor little what about the poor kids ?
same thing .
no !
free lunches have to .
did they !
vote for ronald reagan the poor kids ?
no way !
they k don't .
have enough money to have a car and vote !
yes .
that's true .
but what about .
the teachers did the teachers vote for ronald reagan ?
our !
teacher .
voted for .
mondale .
did she ?
you know why ?
because .
reagan doesn't want to pay the teachers any money .
doesn't she ?
doesn't he .
no he doesn't want to .
he .
i talked to a teacher and she said that .
teachers .
teachers were very she felt !
that the teachers were firmly .
behind mondale .
strongly mondale .
i know there's not much doubt about that .
but it doesn't seem to transcend to the .
it's funny .
the rest of the community .
and that's !
why i think .
this .
i'm four years old .

people are dying everyone dies in the whole live world .

do you know who this man .
instead of wheels .
do you know who this man was ?
why does it thaw ?
johnny appleseed .
no .
yeahhuh .
who ?
isaac newton .
i thought ?
johnny appleseed .
do you know why ?
because he was the man who dis who thought about gravity gravity .
he's the man who discovered that things fall .
why do you think why does it fall ?
what's this man's name .
marky ?
because nothing is falling on falling onto it .
isaac newton isaac newton .
isaac newton .
sir isaac newton .
is was a great discoverer of all the things that fall .
i'm not talking about him .
the reason why they fall is because nothing's holding them up so the center of gravity is pulling them down .
and the center of gravity where is the center of gravity in our world ?
right .
right .
like right in the center of the earth .
very good .
ross .
where'd you learn that ?
mr wizard's world .
wonderful .
okay now .
why do they come down ?
sorry .
ross .
read that .
why do they come down ?
okay .
because this one it holds this piece ?
there so the air catches it up and only he only sometimes he loses air on up on top .
my turn .
my turn .
my turn .
right .
so he catches more and floats down .
and because of the center of gravity it pulls her down .
okay now mark .
wait let mark do this one .
this is a tough one .
what happened here .
marky ?
can you tell me the whole story about what happened here ?
you you know these in here ?
a kid was playing .
and he sat on here real hard .
and what happened ?
he fell .
shelf fell down .
no the stuff fell .
see that and it pulled out of the wall .
see those little nails ?
it pulled out of the wall .
see that ?
you think his father's going to be mad ?
when he lands .
okay .
now this is ross' turn to read .
okay .
how does it fall ?
how does it get up ?
the way it falls is because .
no why does it fall ?
why does it fall ?
because the center of gravity is like .
right .
just .
pointed down .
right ?
pointed down and .
cause because he's like fighting against the center of gravity to get up .
very good .
and what does he use to fight against the center of gravity ?
his muscles and his bones .
his muscles right .
the muscles pull on the bones .
and the muscles and the bones and the heart are all together fighting .
right .
with the center of gravity .
right .
and that that makes him act like a little missile that goes up !
and he jumps up top .
how come he lands on his right feet ?
because his center of gravity like it it like it goes like like .
when you when you land's sort of like it seems to like want you to land on your right feet .
and cats and cats are made that way .
cats are made so that when they're falling .
they land on their right feet .
right .
cause their little muscles pull their feet around .
and they always land on their feet .
now .
this is marky's turn .
okay we're going to see this .
marky ?
why does it go down ?
because there's a whole in it .
and it runs down .
water always runs downhill .
right ?
okay .
and why does this go down ?
cause the girl picks it off picks it with her hand .
right ?
okay .
what lifts up it up ?

crane !
what makes it go up ?
now we're going to learn what makes things go up .
you guys ready ?
it because the the fire is burning a hole through the ground and the ground like it's burning a hole like maybe the fire is like pushing the missile up .
you're right .
ross .
it pushes against it .
and fighting .
like it pushes against the ground to push this thing up .
same thing over here the air the air pushes against the other air .
but it's actually what's happening is not just the pushing against the ground which is very important .
it's it's like it's like it's not burning a hole .
only the it's like you know it it shoots and it .
a balloon goes up in the air .
tries to shoot up and maybe sometimes it shoots down .
right .

it's the reason it's taking so long to get here is because there's not as many kids yelling on the bus .
i know .
and so you don't you think that things are happening real slowly .
and mark fell asleep .
right ?
poor little marky .
he lost ?
away from the car i guess .
can't do that .
why don't we pick him up .
pick him up real quietly and take him up to take a nap .
right ?
he loves to take naps in cars .
have you noticed that ?
especially over where the paper is .
right .
could you put fix his paper for him so it's not all bent up ?
i get schenley pool .
the wave pool and the fantasy pool all mixed up .
they're all pools that i know that's why .
you don't really get them too mixed up .

how much money do you have ?
five dollars and fifteen cents .

well you're going to add some money .
aren't you ?
five dollars and let's see .
didn't you get some dimes ?
didn't you get some dimes ?
but the .
i think i could add another twenty cents probably .
so about five dollars and thirty five cents .
right ?
five dollars and fif what's fifteen with five ?
twenty .
and what's okay five dollars and thirty cents .
very good .
because mark gave got two dimes and you got one dime .
right ?
no he gave me he gave me three dimes .
he earned a lot of money .
didn't you earn one dime one nickel ?
now mark also did extra art so he gets one more quarter .

so i said that a couple of times ".
just go over and say ".
may i have some water .
please .
so mark went over to ian and said ".
i know you don't have any water .
right ?
yes or no .
yes or no is something he learns from me .
i do , when i am very impatient , i just want a straight answer , yes or no .
that obviously changed mary's nice way of formulating it .
i just totally messed up the nice setup mary gave him .

well if i hadn't done that smart stuff my neck would have come off .
but it wouldn't have come off in real life if .
it .
had .
happened in real life .
look .
mark that's .
oo .
that's very dangerous .
mark you could really slip and .
fall on your noggin .
what's a noggin ?
what your noggin is your head .
there's one more thing you should .
be careful of .
what's that „ mark ?
your jaw .
yes that's true .
because your t teeth might fall off .
that's true .
your pretty teeth .
what if it did ?
probably it would hurt .
i'm guessing you're .
it gets wiggly .
you know when your tooth is starting to come out it gets wiggly .
does it ?
how do you know ?
my meredith once she had her she was going on her teeth .
falling out .
her teeth falling out ?
one of her .
teeth .
one of her teeth .
well .
well her her she wiggled her .
we gotta wiggle her tooth .
each one of you ?
each one of us .
how many kids ?
all the kids .
that's a lot of wiggles .
and that is a lot of wiggles !
okay mark .
finished ?
i'm finished .
could i please be excused „ please ?
yes you may please be excused .
and i said two pleases for mamma .
that's good „ dear .
that's because this is your real mamma and not that nasty woman with a mask .
know that .
your real mamma does not have a mask .
and she loves you .
she doesn't break your neck either .
your real mommy is a lovely woman .
you gotta watch out for those .
i know .
i'm not sure whether i recorded this or not from yesterday .
but i think i should .
it i was telling ross yesterday that .
wait a second .
i'm having a little trouble with this recording level .
i think i'll turn it down .
hold on .
hi .
okay i'm going to record down at a lower level .
record at a lower .
there we go .
okay .
yesterday i was telling ross that i caught him lying .
now i'm trying to remember what the lie was that i caught him doing .
yes .
he said ".
i asked him how many cookies he had .
and he said he had had two .
and he was on his third .
and i said ".
you mean three .
you're on your third now „ right ?
and he said ".
i was just checking to see if you knew .
or something he said .
and i said ".
ross don't lie to me .
i can you know parents know an awful lot .
and they can catch their little children when they lie .
and i really don't like it when you lie .
and he said ".
i i k i ch i sh .
so it was s s s so before this i said ".
you mean three you've had ?
yes yes i've had three .
he said ".
i he corrected himself .
to say ".
yes i've had three .
so that he cleaned up his lie a little bit .
and then then i went through the spin of parents can tell if children have lies .
and he said ".
that's w that's why i know p i know parents can find lies .
that's why i .
i changed and told the truth .
and .
and i said ".
you know ross .
it's not worth it to lie because parents can parents know a lot of things so they can find out when they make lies .
and .
you know and so ross interpreted this not as .
a thing that he should watch out for or worry about because parents are always going to find out his lies but as a statement about parental skills being more than children's skills .
and he said ".
well you can't learn how to break dance .
of course because it's true .
it is parental skills .
right it is parental skills .
and he wanted to point out that ".
okay so you're so great .
you can tell about lies .
but i can breakdance .
well what would be the other way of him proving it ?
well i'll watch .
you're you have a good point .
i'll try not to .
i the other was point would ".
i'll be i'll try not to lie because it is .
you're right .
it is it is a good idea in life not to get caught .
and it's you know it was to take it as an admonition rather than as a challenge .
he took it as a challenge .
to to his ability .
i he may have taken it as an admonition too .
right .
but then he he had a real gleam in his eye .
well i can brea .
and he thought he was so cute showing that something that he could do .
but anyway .
you hadn't gotten on top of him .
he certainly .
he i hadn't gotten on top of him .
that was the thing .
and he's certainly working to maintain a full conversational presence .
maintain .
i think would be a full a full persona .
he did he did pretty well .
he didn't i mean he didn't quite make it through because he missed the point .
tell them about his little conversation with mark and ross's interaction with us .
ross .
on the side of well this conversation about mark telling us about his dream witch .
talking about a witch or .
ross said .
he didn't say anything „ did he ?
he didn't say anything .
he had a gleam in his eye .
but his .
and laughing along with the two of us .
he said ".
no he did say one thing .
he said something about ".
she wasn't your real mom „ was she ?
real mom wouldn't act like that „ would she ?
haw .
ha .
mom in other words mommy .
he unders he sort of understood that dreams do reflect a little bit of reality .
and that isn't it cute that mark isn't in on that yet ?
well you and i were kind of smiling at each other .
and he picked up on that .
right right we were smiling .
and he picked up on that .
and in the same tenor he actually sort of verbalized a little bit about it with .
he was in the know .
he was .
with his parents .
with his parents m l le about little baby brother .
isn't it cute ?
he's he's do he does a lot of that .
marky came up the stairs and said ".
i'm homesick .
and ross said ".
you are at home .
and he said ".
i'm homesick not seasick .
because i'm at home and because of my swishing around head .
i guess he had probably came up the stairs too fast and feeling dizzy .
and at last i get to go to the bathroom .
mark drew a maze .
and he showed me a star at the top of the page .
and he said ".
look !
you see that i put the star there .
and i said .
and he said ".
because i wanted to remind of yourself that it was a starting .
get it ?
starting ?
so anyway on the maze he had draw drawn a start at a starting point .
w ross is watching mark put jam on .
a big kaiser roll , big hamburger roll .
and ross said ".
mark i think you think that's an oversized roll .
no muffin .
muffin .
and mark said ".
i don't .
it's just a little bit big .
ross .
called rather the nurse called from school on the phone .
and he she that i one of my sons wanted to talk to me .
so it was mark on the phone .
and he got on the phone .
and he said ".
mom my head feels hard .
and then he said it felt hot .
but the nurse said it didn't feel hot .
and anyway the nurse came back on the phone and said ".
no mark's mark doesn't have a fever .
and he he doesn't have a hot head .
and i said ".
well maybe his head feels h hard , inside hard .
and she said ".
well no he's feeling the outside of it .
and he says it feels hard on one side .
mark well he had the nurse call .
and she called me today .
do you want to do you want to play what i'm playing ?
and he said ".
because i .
wasn't feeling good .
i had a hard head .
and it was warm .
he turns into .
mark went to the cat drawer and pulled out some .
catnip .
and he said ".
well this will work him up .
it's interesting that he used that word because we don't generally use it for the cat or anyone .
except for we do say it to ross when we say ".
watch out .
you're going to get mark all worked up .
but we don't use that word any other time .
mark brought up this strange subject of ".
mom do people ever think that little guys little kids .
that other people no do people ever think that other people are robbers who aren't robbers ?
and i hadta talk that one through and see if he really meant what he said he was meaning or something or another .
and we got finished with that topic .
and he said ".
i said how little kids even five year olds in bad neighborhoods were robbers .
stop it ross .
and .
so then he said ".
well where's my milk .
and i went out to get him his glass of milk .
and he .
when i came back .
i noticed that the cushion from my chair was gone .
and he had stolen it and put it on another chair .

no .
you didn't try to trap me into it ?
you sure ?
just .
i asked for a toy but then you you said no .
right .
but then you told me about gadget and then i spent my money .
well .
you'd already earned money hadn't you ?
but i didn't know that .
you didn't know how much you had so then you went and checked how much you had right ?
and you figured you might have enough .
so then .
and then i said i won't promise to take you today right .
and then what happened ?
but then i read a couple of books and we made .
no then you came out and while i was mowing the lawn did this campaign about today or tomorrow today or tomorrow right ?
and i said who knows , right ?
and then finally i gave in right ?
no you didn't finally give in .
how did it happen ?
but before that i already started to promise you .
how did i give in ?
well .
you don't remember ?
you said maybe we could use our money .
you you asked me about ten times .
you were using us i about with our money .
but you asked me about ten times you know today or tomorrow right ?
and finally .
no i asked you three times .
and then i said i'll make you a deal if you read a book then i'll get it tonight .
no i read two books .
well .
you started on three right .
two books and you started on a third but they were real simple weren't they ?
so you didn't get .
well y well some were hard .
no .
some words were hard .
you mean like fiddling in s .
in father s in father christmas .
fiddling not .
fiddling buttons fiddling buttons means you have to fiddle with them .
right .
anyway finally i got persuaded but the deal that we've struck .
now is that this is going to be the last present for a long time .
right ross ?
and also what happens if we get down there and you don't have enough money for a gadget ?
that's a present that i had recommended .
then we will have to earn more money .
have to earn more money and what happens are you going to buy any toys down there then ?
no .
well maybe we could get something cheaper .
and then bring most of your money back home ?
okay and then go back when you had more ?
okay .
and what if you had almost enough money not quite .
well maybe you could help out a little .
then will you pay me back for the extra amount that i give you ?
i'll vacuum up the house .
and what else ?
and let's see .
i'll i'll help mom take out the silverware and stuff out of the dishwasher .
he said i'll help mom take out silverware and stuff out of the dishwasher .
and maybe !
i'll help you guys plant some seeds or plants in the in the forest .
sounds good ross .
okay .
and if i don't do the planting .
i'll clean up our room .
okay .
when when nobody's using it it's a mess .
okay and what about mark what is he going to do to earn extra money in case .
he's going to help .
what if what if we .
like i'm going to pull grass .
that's good you do a good job on grass .
he's well he's .
he's the grass expert .
he's going to do a couple more jobs though .
like what ?
like he told you pulling grass .
and and he's also going to the jobs that i do .
okay .
and you know the deal is that .
we're not going to buy you any more things unless it comes out of your money from now on .
okay ?
you understand ?
okay .
mom .
what did you say ?
ross ?
well .
mom didn't say anything when she just gave me the dollars and then told me to to bring them up to you .
no that wasn't what you told me you said that she gave you you this .
i said i said all that we need to earn two dollars each of us needs to earn two dollars and then .
why do you needta earn the two dollars ?
and then and then in put them both into one and make it four and and then .
to pay off daddy .
and i told her that i read three books .
right .
which one are you ?
is that right ?
heads or tails ?
you gave you paid off his whole debt ?
i gave him one dollar cause he said he done all the books .
which one are you heads or tails ?
he had done .
and i gave him the tw the other money because i wanted him to give that to you .
but the only the dollar was part of your debt .
which one are you heads or tails ?
only the dollar was your p your part and the rest of that money was just because i wanted somebody to give daddy the money .
you understand ross ?
i didn't explain it to ross .
well the of twenties were .
he thought he was paying off his debt .
isn't that sweet .
well he was paying off part of it .
how much has he paid off mom ?
he paid off one .
okay ross explain what happened .
well then mom didn't decide to give you the money .
the the hard one .
the two twenty dollar bills .
the stiff ones .
for food i think .
for food .
food .
and then .
and she gave .
me the rough the soft one dollar bill to give it to you for the bet .
for the bet .
well that wasn't the way you presented it to me though when you came up there ross .
well i didn't know she didn't tell me .
you didn't understand the whole thing because you think mommy didn't explain .
i didn't say anything i said here's the one .
well i told him he would get in real trouble if he was if he was misrepresenting .
said here's the one give daddy the rest of this .
i didn't explain what it was .
i see .
no wonder .
i said it's a lot of money so .
no wonder he was under the impression that maybe that was going to clear his debt so how much of your debt have you cleared ross ?
what ?
how much of your debt have you cleared ?
one .
mark's gotta do two dollars .
i gave him a quarter .
i only have i only have to do one more dollar .
but we know there's a way for you to do this .

that's right .
you just don't know .
ross .
i do not eat soup !
yes .

because you * doesn't because the real rossy wasn't .
in my dream .
the real rossy wasn't in his dream .
ross .
it was just the dream ross .

well then .
maybe you got tiffany's ross .

yes .

ross alexander macwhinney ?
ross alexander macwhinney ?
are you her boyfriend ?
are you sure you're not her boyfriend ?
and you know what ?
and he's .
look what i've got .
he's older .

you know who i like better ?
his name is ross ?
you know who i like better than .

you know .
know who i like better than those dumb .
hated mud people ?
who ?

better than those dumb hated mud people ?
were there mud people in your dream ?

i would kick them .
you can't kick mud people .
dad .
you know i had an idea ?
why not ?
know what .
ross ?
well these ewoks were playing .
they g good and and bad ewoks and .
by accident one someone shot the catapult .
it hit almost hit a ewok named .
gargamel ?
skyscraper .
he was so little so they called him skyscraper .
i see .
isn't that funny ?
how many kids want to eat breakfast with daddy ?
well it's not yet done yet .
but then they were .
i want to sleep .
he were they were all .
i want to sleep .
yes .
he brought a .
picture to me and i said ".
what is that ?
and he said ".
i'll draw it .
i'll show you what oudi what it is .
and he went back and he wrote .
and i said ".
it's , , .
and he said ".
whatever .
and he said and he wanted a and he took it to mary and he said “look .
mom .
it's a mobby” .
i mean .
and .
what's interesting about this is that he he's a little bit earlier , he was saying what's and said it's a and what's and this is a and he kept on spelling random letter combinations and i hadta pronounce them .
a lot of them were unpronounceable .
and he seems to have gotten the idea that you can just ts ts throw letters together and some how and some how they'll make a word .
this is very much like when he was a little baby he used to sort of make up words even though they didn't really mean anything sort of to describe some unspecifiable thing .
now he is writing them out .
mary says that she used to do that when she was a kid .
now i certainly never remember doing any thing like that .
she also remembers taking pictures to people and asking them what what they were .
again i'd never do anything quite like that i mean any where near like that .
i can never did anything in fact that i can remember that was very fantasy oriented at all .
ross is having some .
orange juice .
and .
i take took a little sip from glass .
before .
i want some good juice .
i gave it to him .
and ross complains , .
said “daddy took some of mine” or something like that he said .
and i said “i'm just testing” .
and he said “you're not testing” .
i already what'd you say ?
i already had a glass ?
and which means that .
i already had some and i liked it .
i already had some and i liked it , .
you you'd already poured me a glass and you knew it was okay at that point .
and i knew it was okay .
so why are you .
checking for the consistency at a later point .
it couldn't have changed by now .
i asked ross “could you be a little nicer” and he said “i hate being nice” .
am i being nice ?
am i being nice ?
you're being nice .
and then he said i when were you so nice ?
and he said “i hadta be that way all the way home yesterday” .
hadta be that way all the way home yesterday .
in the car coming home from washington dc .
yes .
that's true .
you were good yesterday .
then why can't i be bad today ?
zzz .
well .
why do i have to make breakfast and bring you things ?
why do i have to be that good mother ?
when i'd really just like to sit here and stuff my face .
just make coffee for me .
just make the rolls for me .
just serve myself .
forget you .
stop doing .
i have to say .
would you like some tea .
honey ?
yes .
and then if you say yes .
i have to go out there and make it .
instead of drinking my coffee .
why do i have to be nice like that .
ross .
come back .
he's going to give you a kiss .
he's going to .
maybe he's come and do something nice .
zzz .
zzz .
he came around and got his own honey instead of asking someone for it .
because he knew that if he he would be told that he w he was asking and demanding for too too many things , right ?
ross use your spoon when you do that okay ?
i was .
and i'm going to .
how come you didn't let him pour it ?
what ?
you don't want him pour it ?
no it's too much .
you're going to lose your spoon .
twirl your spoon .
twirl it around .
good !
now go !
good .
marky .
what would you like ?
and then you can lick your spoon .
but don't use it again .
i know .
marky .
just did a picture .
and he said “i can't wait all day” .
he came up to me , “i can't wait all day” !
what he meant was that he wanted me too .
i assume that what he wanted what it was me to put a name on it and have me date it so it was .
or look at it .
look at it or something , .
pay some attention to it .
and , so i put a name on it , date it and .
and he i said “okay go put it over on ross's desk” and he said “i'll put it in pile” .
in other words he didn't say the !
pile .
i put it in “put it in a pile” .
drop drop the .
what do we have for lunch ?
macaroni and cheese , bread , and corn , and .

a man or a woman ?
man !
a man, why do you think that ?
because ju just do .
why ?
because women don't like to go on boats ?
i guess .
you think so ?
okay .
did you know what ?
do you know daddy's aunt ?
firstname ?
she was a navy nurse so she was on boats for twenty years in the service .

i want to ask you why .
here, you're going to fall on couch .
no i'm not .
no ?
okay .
i want to be on that side .
do you like flowers ?
do you think firstname likes flowers ?
no .
no ?
why not ?
because he's a boy ?
i don't know .
here, come here .
because you think you think boys don't like flowers as much as girls ?
why is that ?
i don't know .
is it because their moms teach them to be that way do you think ?
i don't know .
or you think their dads teach them to be that way ?
i don't know .
do you really don't know or are you just goofing around ?
i don't know .
okay you're not are you being serious ?
i don't know .
okay, shall we move on to the next one ?
i don't know .
okay, here we needta be serious, okay ?
why ?
because we really want to know what you think ?

and we're waiting for you to tell us how much you know .
i really didn't know .
okay .
here's another question .
who can paint a house ?
women, men, dogs, cats, hamsters .
here, let's be serious, okay ?
let's be serious, okay ?
who can paint a house ?
people .
people, anybody ?
yup .
as long as you got an arm, right ?
yup .
you got an arm, they can paint .
yes, if they have one arm, they can't paint .
why not ?
you can paint with one arm .
couldn't you ?
no, it's hard then .
well, it might be hard but if you can climb up on a ladder, you can paint right ?
okay .
but you'd have to be able to see, wouldn't you ?
yes .
you'd have to have eyes, because in order to paint, you needta see what you're doing, ?
yes .
okay, so that's a woman painting .
do you think a lot of women like to paint ?
do you think they like to paint houses or do they paint pictures ?
paint pictures .
and they're and they're artists, and they do women do more of that ?
who does more painting houses ?
men .
men ?
why is that ?
i don't know .
do you think painting houses is harder ?
so is that why a man would do it ?
and is painting a picture easier ?
is that why a woman would do it ?
yup .
you think women can't do hard stuff ?
is that what you're telling me ?
they can't ?
how come ?
because they can't lift weights .
so women don't have enough muscles .
is that it ?
but they have more brains than men .
why is that ?
i don't know .
you don't know .
okay .
alright .
who can be a firefighter ?
who's that ?
is that a man or a woman ?
man .
a man ?
can only men be firefighters ?
no .
women can too .
pra probably do you see more men firefighters or women firefighters ?
men .
more men ?
why do you think that is ?
i just do .
you know why ?
probably because if you have to run into a building and save people, they want you to be strong so you can lift out people and drag them out of the house .
especially if they can't walk or if they're unconscious .
that's probably why they want big strong people .
so maybe if you're a big strong woman, you could be a firefighter, ?
i guess .
what do you think ?
i don't know .
okay .

wohh women, men, dogs, cats .

getting the house dirty .

they get fat ?
i don't think that's why the do lifting weights, to get fat .
they do it to be strong .

so that this .
and then i take this and pour it back in here .
okay .
laura has repeated the whole task .
pouring task .
would you pour it .
this water in the tall glasses that all the other glasses please ?

go ahead .
okay .
now .
why don't you stop pouring right there .
we need some in your measuring cup .
you're going to make it even in each cup ?
do you have the same amount in each cup do you think ?
so each are going to get a little bit in the measuring cup .
okay .
well how will you know when you have the same amount in the measuring cup ?
because .
there .
almost .
okay .
you've taken a little water from each cup .

alright .
how are you deciding , laura , that there's the same amount in each cup ?
well .
look .
i'll sh .
are you looking on the side of the cup ?
but but this cup is taller .
don't you .
and skinnier than this cup .
don't you have to put more water in that cup ?
no .
she's not putting this .
she's not compensating .
we're just making it the same level as each cup .
even this taller one ?
it's skinnier than .
look .
look how much bigger and wider the purple cup is .
yes .
yes but it doesn't matter .
how come it doesn't matter ?
i think it matters .
don't you have to .
okay .
so laura just measured the water level .
they all have the same .
they all have the same amount of water ?
are you sure ?
yes .
you sure this .
the this .
this tall glass has as much as this big wide glass ?
the ?
but this doesn't have as much .
how come ?
this has more .
look .
a little bit ?
laura's pouring from the wide glass into the smaller glass and making the water levels be absolutely ?
the same .
look see .
okay .
very interesting , laura .

guess what ?
guess what ?
that times and .
i don't know .
i don't know the minus thing times is called again .
but those aren't only one of those shows .
okay .

you're doing a great job though !
you don't .
you can stop reading if you want .
you can just show him the favorite space picture .
and we can be all done .
okay .
sounds good .
so you can go ahead and hit a buzzer .
you're doing an awesome job .
what the heck is this ?
woah .
go ahead nn hit a buzzer .
look at the picture .
go ahead and hit a buzzer .
you want to hit a buzzer ?
a buzzer ?
then we can look at the picture .
the orange one .
alright .
so what do you think is ?
look at the picture .
okay .
this one's a cool one, right ?
it's in space .
this looks like an alien ship lifting off from the moon .
what are these things right here ?
i think he's throwing them or something .
what do you think ?
well he came from the rocket i think .
of course he did .
cause that's where scientists can only be .
this looks like a comet .
or actually .
it looks like a comet to me .
what is this thing up here ?
i'm not sure .
what do you think ?
maybe something floating .
maybe .
so what do you think this person is doing ?
throwing out stickers or something .
i think these are stickers .
alright .
this this planet kinda looks like jupiter .
and this one looks like saturn .
another saturn kind of .
this looks like a moon .
wait no .
this looks like a jupiter .
doesn't it ?
maybe .
these look like .
the dots looks like stars .
is this ?
this looks like a ladybug .
what's a ladybug doing in space ?
i don't know .
what do you think it's doing there ?
how do you think it got there ?
i know .
how did it get there ?
would you ever go to space ?
i'm hoping to .
that that's my .
i i'm hoping to do that in the future .
anything else you want to say about this one ?
and then we can be all done .
it looks like the rocket isn't moving or anything .
it looks like it's just floating without it's it's boosters on .
of course, i think it's of course it's doing so the person doesn't crash into anything while it's doing that .
that would be important .
it would probably the person would probably crash into this asteroid .
no .
into the comet .
i think no actually .
don't kk don't the trail of comets is ice or something ?
i have no idea .
i think it is .
hh hh .
no .
i think the comet will shoot at, before him .
and then he'll fall into the ice .
and then it get frozen .
so that's actually very dangerous if that rocket was moving .
sounds good .
anything else ?
no .
you did so awesome .

you're all done .

a garden is a place where people grow food or flowers .
gardens can be big or small .
gardens can be in the ground .
or they can be in a small pot .
gardens can be at home or at a church .
some kids have gardens at their school !
there are gardens at the white house .
the home of the president of the united states .
one garden grows food .
and the other garden is the rose garden .
you need four things to grow a garden .
a sunny spot, good soil, water, and time .
a sunny spot .
plants need sunshine to grow nice vegetables and flowers .
a spot that faces south is best .
good soil .
soil is a kind of dirt .
pile the soil up like a small hill so that the water can go down .
the pile of soil should be about twelve inches .
or the size of a ruler .
it is good for your plants if worms live in the soil .
to invite worms put cut up leaves three inches down in your soil .
soil .
water .
gardens do well if they get about one inch of rain every each week .
if it is hot and dry outside you will need to give more water to your garden .
the best test is to put your finger in the soil .
if you get mud on your hands it is too wet .
if the soil is dusty the plant needs water .
time .
some plants grow in a few weeks .
others take a few months .
you must wait and take care of your plants .
then you can enjoy the food and flowers from your garden !
the sweet potato is a root vegetable .
that means it is grown under the ground .
sweet potatos are large and sweet .
sweet potatos are long .
the skin of the sweet potato can be yellow, orange, red, brown, purple, or tan .
on the inside, the sweet potato can be tan, white, red, yellow .
it is not very sweet .
the sweet potato will taste sweeter if it is red, pink, or orange .
there are many ways to cook a sweet potato .
you can bake it in the oven .
you can make sweet potato fries .
you can even make sweet potato pie !

i tt .
my teacher taught me that i can use my fingers to count .

i think i'm going to want to move on to the next one .
okay .
you might not know this one .
i nn i ff .

you can just read it if you want .
six ff .
times .
three .
six times three .
and this is division .

it's okay .
you did great with the rest .
we don't need to worry about that one .
okay .

the boy .
and they did a lion on a boat .
and they are seeing lots of lilypads and fish .
how do you think they ended up here ?
they put a boat in the water .
and they started paddling .
i have no idea where to pad .
i think the .
i think .
and that's all i think .
so who's in the boat ?
there a little boy .
and the lion .
so how do you think they ended up there together ?
the little boy was getting the boat ready .
and when he saw a lion .
and it was a talking lion .
and the lion said may i please come on your boat with you ?
and the boy said yes .
what a polite lion .
so what do you think the lion's talking about if it can talk then ?
wait talking about getting on the boat ?
what do you think the lion's telling the boy ?
what stories ?
he he just really wants to get on the boat and get over his fear on water .
lion's don't really like water .
they're part of the cat family .
and cat's don't like water .
do you have any cats ?
i have a cat named pancake .
i love cats .
she got run over by a car .
so that's why .
okay .
is sh is the cat alright now ?
good .
okay .
so with the lion and the boy, do you think that you would ever be friends with a lion ?
i like lions .
really ?
what would you do with the lion ?
i would .
if he was hungry, i would give him a snack .
and i would talk to him and tell jokes .
so awesome .
have you ever been on a lake like this ?
well i have been on a lake .
but it didn't have as many lilypads or fish .
we didn't see fish that often .
it ww .
we also went on a stream while we were camping .
and we i ss i sat on .
i sitted on the front .
so i got to see all the fish .
daddy only saw one of the big fishes .
he didn't see all three of them that i saw .
woah .
how big were they ?
about this big .
this long .
and about this big .
so did you do any fishing ?
no .
okay .
we were on a kayak ride .
gotcha .
i mean .
i mean hold on .
it was when we were camping .
so it was a .
actually it was a .
i can't remember .
it's okay .
that's awesome .
it's gg .
are you ready for the next one ?
okay .
so this one .
can you tell me what you see first ?
so there is a boy holding a paper airplane .
pretending that he is a airplane driver .
and there are cars on the bottom to look like he's using his bed as a bridge .
and he's using hih the top of his bed as the sky .
so what things do you see here ?
like over here, down here, over there .
i see cars .
paper airplanes .
aa fish .
books .
a sock .
pillow .
more pillows .
so .
and that's all i see .
so for this kid right here .
so what do you think he's doing ?
what's going on ?
he's pretending to be a pilot .
and .
i have no idea .
that's okay .
you can take a guess .
i think he's pretending to be a pilot and flying his paper airplanes .
would you ever do something like this ?
i would clean up my room in case i jumped down .
so i wouldn't hurt my feet .
that would hurt .
so do you ever want to be a pilot like this ?
no .
what do you want to be ?
a singer .
because i like to sing .
and i'm a really good piano player .
i haven't took piano lessons .
but i'm pretty good at it .
woah .
that's awesome .
what type of stuff do you like to sing ?
i don't really sing that much in front of people .
because i have never singed in front of a person before .
that's okay .
that's why i like singing by myself .
personal .
well i'm sure you have a beautiful voice .
and i when i step down on my piano thing, it makes the music that i play really loud .
so everybody can hear it .
how long have you played piano ?
first .
i can't remember the first time i played the piano .
but when i was playing the piano, i .
when i first stepped on the thing, i played it .
and it wa .
i was like that's loud .
no way .
and .
hold on .
i'm thinking .
and when i played the piano, it kinda i make it loud so everybody can hear my practice .
and i've been doing it since i left for michigan .
why what'd you get for michigan for ?
just for summer break .
do you have family there ?
awesome !
are you done with this one ?
looks like you want to move on .
alright .
good job .
so what do ?
what do you see here ?
i feel so .
i feel like she's pretending to be a scientist .
because she has a lab coat .
she's holding that and a lightbulb .
and there're bunch of things scientists would have .
and that's how i would describe it .
what things do you see on the floor ?
i see a mouse .
books .
another mouse .
what about here ?
i see a magnifying glass .
a .
is that an octopus or an elephant ?
looks like an octopus .
but it can be whatever you want it to be .
it has a lot of arms .
elephants don't have that many arms .
so it's probably an octopus .
but let me count its arms .
one two three four five six seven eight nn .
woah .
eight .
it has eight .
that's how many an octopus has .
eight arms .
so that's all i see .
do you think that ?
what what do you think the octopus is doing there ?
it's holding up her stuff to show her what she's done so far .
so do you think that they're friends, they're helping each other or what ?
i think they're friends .
that's what i think .
do you like science ?
but my most favorite thing is math .
because you get to add and not add and take away .
that ststuff .
that's cool .
so that's really awesome .
anything else about this one ?
nah .
alrightie !
this is our last one .
what do you see here ?
so i see a girl picking a giant radish .
that is a really big radish .
and i see a snail .
another snail .
little radishes .
and another snail .
a carrot .
also a carrot .
there i think that's all .
okay .
so .
so you told me some stuff about what you see .
but what do you think is happening ?
i think she is pretending she is helping somebody with their farming and stuff .
she's helping pick out the fruits and shovel and plant .
that's what i think .
great .
so what do you think she's going to do with this ?
i think she's going to ss .
i think whoever owns the farm is going to slice it up into really big things .
and then it's going to be something for lunch or something .
or to make a really the biggest the world's biggest sandwich .
that would be a pretty big sandwich .
have you ever had a vegetable that big ?
no .
no i haven't .
so do you like to garden like this ?
or what do you do ?
i don't .
i sometimes garden .
but i don't garden that often .
okay .
well if you did, what fruits or veggies would you like to garden ?
i think i would do tomatoes .
we actually grew tomatoes once .
i ate one whole .
but they were little .
they weren't the size of real tomatoes .
they were just little tomatoes .
i ate one .
whole .
so you would garden tomatoes .
what else ?
i would probably make do trees of apples and .
and i think that's all i would grow .
i'm ff .
i'm not sure what else i would grow .
do you like any fruits ?
i like bananas .
okay .
i also have a wiggly tooth .
i notice .
that's fun .
are you excited to get your tooth out ?
i also have some growing up here .
do do you lose tooth often right now ?
what ?
do you lose them often at this age ?
nah .
okay .
not really .
that's very cool .
why ?
the first .
when i wiggle the tt my teeth with .
not the wiggly one .
but the one's that aren't wiggly yet .
it feels like they're wiggly with my loose tooth .
it feels like it .
does it make it hard to eat a little ?
no .
no ?
okay .
but when i eat apples or bananas when i bite near my tooth it hurts .
so i can't .
every time i try to get my tooth out with biting apple, owie ih gah i can't do it .
i can only eat on this side .
gosh .
well hopefully soon it'll come out .
so that it doesn't bother you anymore .
and i gah and i get sacagawea coins .
that's once you get the tooth out ?
you get it after the tooth comes out ?
and then i have .
once i put it on my ipad .
so the tooth fairy could see it .
and i was worried wordn't because that time my bed was white .
no .
and the tooth is white .

older ?
so she can .
she's strong enough to carry it ?
what do you think she's doing with it ?
i think she's going to put it back in the ground .
you think she's going to put it back in the ground ?
maybe she's planting it ?
but that would be a little weird .
because it looks like a seed and it's grow .
maybe .

can you tell me what they're doing in the picture ?
and how you do it .
first you take out your toothbrush .
and you get your toothpaste out .
and then you put some on .
but not a lot .
then it would make a big mess .
and i think that's the only thing he's doing .
good job .
okay .
let's see .
he looks like he's he's washing his hands in the ss .
but first he gets soap .
and then you put the water on .
he's tying his shoes .

do you know how to tie your shoes ?
not yet ?
okay .
and she's pouring cereal in .
and then she's putting milk in .
but you have to be careful .
because you don't want to spill it .
do you eat cereal ?
yes .
what's your favorite ?
i forgot .
you forgot ?
that's okay .
he's getting his shirt on .
and sometimes when it's hard to get your shirt on you could go ask your mommy or your daddy .

she can just wipe it off .

and you gotta shower .
do you like painting ?

what do you usually paint ?
sometimes i paint my friends and my mommy and daddy .
and i think that's it .
that's so nice .
do you give your paintings to them ?
when he's .
you have to seat belt when you're on the bus .
because if you don't seat belt sometimes you might go .
sometimes you might sometimes you might fall off or something .
you have to put your seat belt on for safety .
by the way that looks really .
this one looks like it's full already .
and that .
she looks like she's feeding a bear .
and she is .
but it isn't a real bear .
have you ever done that ?
yes .

so you don't fall of the edges .
that's true .
and if you're playing that some sometimes when you kick the ball you have to be careful .
because you don't want to fall .
when you share with someone that's nice .
and when you don't share with someone that isn't nice .
very true .

friends sometimes friends help you if you're here .
if they're here .
if if they're here that's nice .
does someone push you on the swing ?
my mommy and daddy do .
ww .
and when you share something when you drop something that's nice too .

can you tell me what's going on in this one ?
he's in space .
if you can't breathe in space that's bad .
he would have to go back up to where he was so he could breathe .
and if something .
if if that meteor hit that that would be awful .
then he couldn't get back home .
my god .
that would be horrible .
do you see any anything around him ?

and there .
and the rest looks like the rest it looks like .
they're they're the world around him .
and sa they those look like butterflies and stuff .
would you ever go in space ?

and the sun might burn your ice cream down .
and it will spill on you .
true .
is that bird trying to eat her ice cream too ?
birds when they eat your ice cream that's a little naughty .
because you have to share .

and he also has some books .
so do you think this kid is playing imaginary or what ?
playing .
maybe he's throwing airplanes up in the sky because there's airplanes up here .

and then my brother told my mom .
and then we ss had to stop .
and then we had and then we were playing with my toys .

it it sounds like it would be fine .
but i guess it is safer to be away from the stairs .
so was someone catching it at the bottom when you would throw it ?

and what do you think might be next ?
two .
heh good guess ha ha ha .
three .
four .
five .
six .
seven .
eight .
nine .
ten .
once we get to each ten i'll stop .
so you can .
okay .
i count very fast .
one, two, three .
i mean .
eleven .
twelve .
thirteen .
fourteen .
fifteen .
sixteen .
seventeen .
eighteen .
nineteen .
twenty .
look .
i'm going to show you something, okay ?
okay .
so this is fifteen, right ?
what ?
what just happened ?
you skipped .
wait wait .
i did ?
from what to what ?
twenty .
so if we went from fifteen to twenty, what might be next ?
five, ten, fifteen, twenty .
twenty five !
that's a really great guess .
and you got it .
what might be next ?
thirty .
you're on it .
thirty five ?
that's a terrific guess .
but actually .
what's this ?
forty .
forty ha ha ha .
so what might be next ?
fifty !
sixty .
sevseventy .
eighty .
ninety .
one hundred .
woah !
you got to one hundred !
what might be next ?
i'll give you a hint .
it might not be expected .
one hundred and one .
that's a good guess .
but we're actually at ?
two hundred .
two hundred .
i mean three hundred ?
good guess .
ff .
ha ha ha what's this ?
five hundred .
and the next one's a really big number .
ten hundred .
that's a great guess .
what's this ?
so we're actually at one thousand .
can you say one thousand ?
one thousand .
you just counted all the way there !
woah !
okay, okay, okay .
alright .
do you know how to do addition yet ?
can you read this ?
and then tell me the answer then ?
nine plus seven equals .
nine .
you can take as much time as you need .
sixteen .
yes !
woah !
what about this one ?
nineteen .
nineteen .
so this one is ss .
twenty !
oo .
that's a good guess .
but .
so this one is actually subtraction .
so that means we're .
so can you read this first ?
nineteen .
minus .
minus one .
so that means you're taking one away .
equals eighteen .
you got it .
awesome .
and then i'm guessing you probably don't know this yet .
right ?
no .
okay we can .
i don't know the x yet .
wait it was times !
times .
you're right !
this is times .
six times three equals nine .
that's a really close guess .
so it's actually a li .
a little ka different than that .
that would be if it was plus .
but that's a really great guess .
and so we can skip this one .
that one's hard .
and this one's hard too .
that's division .
so we'll skip that .
alrightie .

ha !
he gave you little fireworks .
that's awesome .
alright .
but how does he know which .
do i .
when do i finish in ?
so you know how you ?
is someone programming him ?
you know how you talk to siri ?
and siri sometimes knows what to say and sometimes doesn't ?
it's kinda like that .
jibo's just doing his best to respond to what you do .
okay ?
so i want you to look at this picture and tell me everything you see .
okay ?
and what's going on in the picture .
a lion on a boat with a kid in a pond with lilypads and fish .
and a dragonfly above their heads .
with lilies .
with what ?
sorry .
lilies and flowers .
that's that's what i would call them too .
do they look like anything you would know or ?
flowers ?
what kind ?
ope we're going to stay on here just a little bit more .
what kind of flowers ?
any ideas ?
lih like lily .
that's a good guess .
so hh uw how do ?
lily !
these are lilies .
those ones ?
okay .
so how do you think they got in this situation ?
like what would you say had to happen for this to ?
i don't understand what you mean .
if we had to use our imagination and make up a story, why would this boy be in the boat with the lion ?
how did that happen ?
i don't know .
what would you have to do to get into a boat with a lion ?
i don't know .
would you never do that ?
or would you always do that if someone asked you ?
i would never do it .
but why ?
i don't know .
the lion would eat me probably .
that's a good point .
so what ay are there any reasons why the lion is not eating the boy right now ?
any idea .
because he's happy .
okay .
so what ?
i'd rather be on the side of the boat than in the boat right now .
i would as well .
i totally agree with that .
so if the lion's happy and the boy's in the boat where do you think they're going ?
like what would make the lion happy ?
somewhere he likes like home ?
like home .
that's a good idea .
okay .
any other ideas about this picture that you think ?
no .
okay .
moving on to the next one .
guy pretending to be in a plane .
plane pilot in his room with a fish tank .
and he's standing on his bed .
and the sky's like all air .
and his window's open .
that's a really good description .
because not a lot of people pick up on that .
why do you think the artist drew it like that ?
like what what's the point of having that all up there ?
because he wants to be a pilot .
so it's part of the imagination .
gotcha .
i kinda feel vibration .
you do ?
it might be from all the noise .
so .
no not true .
what what else is silly about this picture ?
like what's different than you would expect ?
sky .
instead of ceiling .
why ?
and you told me why that you think that's there .
does this his room look like your room ?
no .
well .
maybe it's this is just paint .
that's a good idea too .
what else about his room is like your room or not like your room ?
mostly not these or like .
the ceiling .
that's all .
for sure .
what what ?
and not the goldfish tank .
you don't have a goldfish .
what about here is different in your room ?
what do you have instead ?
i have like nothing under my bed .
smart .
by the way when we stayed in our house for when we came here, i found hunks of wood and a piece of paper under the beds .
weird !
what a weird set of things to be under the bed .
did you do anything with those ?
we .
i took them out .
that's smart .
and i put them all over the house .
that's maybe not so smart .
so what is he wearing ?
pilot clothes .
okay .
do you have any clothes like that that you could use to pretend to be a pilot ?
nnno .
no ?
so do you dress up as anything though ?
do you have dress up clothes ?
not much i .
not much ?
think .
okay .
last thing .
anything else you haven't told me about yet in this picture ?
but besides a bunch of pillows piled up .
i only have tt .
do you even have that many pillows in your room to pile up ?
i only have three pillows .
alright .
anything else ?
you're you're elbow okay ?
yep .
okay .
beside the pillow on the floor, no .
this guy's a scientist .
with a bun .
i see a guy a girl holding a light bulb .
and a .
piece of paper .
two rats crawling around .
an elephant .
but on the window they're ssstudying beehives .
and a bunch of papers of science around .
and a plant .
and a microscope .
and tubes .
and stuff .
that's awesome .
do you recognize any of these things up here that they're using ?
microscope .
pencil .
light bulb .
books .
drawers .
so what do you think is happening in the situation ?
plants .
like why is the octopus there ?
that's not a .
wait .
what did you call it ?
i thought that was an elephant .
that was an octopus .
i could see how that would be the .
i'm sorry for correcting you .
but no ih ih at first it looks like an elephant .
so why do you think it would be there ?
i don't know .
maybe she caught it .
and she's trying to study ?
she caught it ?
my gosh .
so she's trying to study it .
while he's doing what ?
doodling .
what a smart octopus .
well i doodle a lot too .
and so what what do you think they're ?
ope please don't touch jibo .
thank you .
why ?
why ?
it's the same thing as anything else expensive .
we don't want to have people touch it when they're not supposed to .
so that it doesn't get broken .
so what do you think the rats are doing here ?
crawling around trying to do something weird .
do you think she doesn't ?
do you think she cares if they're there ?
or do you think she minds ?
she minds .
probably the rats are trying to get to the plant to eat it .
that makes sense .
if you had to do science, would you do science like her ?
or would you do something different ?
something different .
like what ?
i'm a sci .
i'm going to be like a scientist that's going to be study like everything .
not just like .
you're interested in every .
well then i see why you come to c s i so often then .
you want to learn about everything .
that's awesome .
anything else you can see in this picture ?
no .
okay .
well at least the octopus has eyes .
seriously ?
a juh a girl pulling a giant radish out of the ground .
with carrots and snails wandering around .
the snails are trying to eat the cabbage and radishes .
and the girl has a shovel behind them .
that's a good description .
it is pretty silly .
so what where is she ?
like what is this place ?
a farm ?
have you ever been on a farm before ?
yes .
was it ?
did it look like this farm ?
no .
what was different about it ?
wait .
never mind .
i didn't go .
never mind .
i didn't go to a farm .
you just kinda don't want to talk about it ?
i think i went to a farm .
not sure .
gotcha .
kinda hard to remember .
so what is she wearing ?
like a farmer's ragged clothes .
so who do you think she is ?
a farmer .
so do you think she owns the farm ?
or what do you think is going on here ?
she's helping .
she's helping out .
okay .
and how can she pull a giant radish out of the ground ?
ih you gotta be pretty strong to do that hhhow big that is .
that's true .
so what did she use to do that ?
a shovel .
ope that one there ?
that makes sense .
any other ideas about what's going on here ?
no .
okay .
besides clouds .
and vines sticking out of the ground .
good description .
the ground might must be moist because .
that's a really good observation .
but how can ?
how can jibo like do some good stuff when i press a buzzer ?
well the same way that siri can respond to sound .
but also visuals with our robot .
it responds to things that goes on around him .
so now tha we're done, .
we're going to see what happens .
nothing !
maybe it likes other buzzers better .
i don't know .
you're doing an awesome job .
alright so .
no fair .
for our next one are you do you know how to read yet ?
can you do your best to read this for me ?
all of it ?
yep .
just do your best .

he ran around the whole park .
he tried to not bump into the little kids .

saturday is our day for fishing .
we have a special spot that we go to each week .
papa says it is a secret .
that's why we need to leave early in the morning .
so no one sees our spot .
i laugh because .
i know people can see us when the sun comes up .
the fish aren't bbbiting .
we have to move to a different spot .
papa says the fish are smart .
that's why they swim in schools .
papa is so funny .
some days we catch lots of fish and come home and cook our fish for our whole family .
sometimes we don't catch any fish .
but i don't care .
i just really like to spend time with papa .

a bear selling bananas and potatos .
would you buy bananas and potatos from a bear ?
why is that out of the ordinary ?

feeding her teddy bear .
how do you do that ?
so you take a toy bowl .

or you'll mess up your teddy bear .
just like i did a long time ago with one of my pink teddy bears .
no .
my pink teddy bear !
i .
did you have to wash it ?
well, .
because it had dog drool .
