this .

the pooh bear .
then i brought out this but he wasn't that into this .
and i brought out this one and he seemed more into that one .
and then i we read this book .
the foot book .
why do you think he was more into one versus the other ?
i think the colors .
the bright orange i think was i probably more .
interesting .
and then the purple .
than just this white and black .
and he also seem interested in the eyes .
on this one .
for whatever reason .
but i think maybe the contrast on here .
was a little bit more interesting to him .
than the black and white one .
is he more familiar with the one word .
than like meaning has he heard it more than the other ?
i doubt it to be honest with you .
because i don't think we really have said bee more than zebra .
or vice versa .
so .
but i'm .
i'm thinking it it might've been the color contrast .
or whatever .
and then .
i think he was .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
baby .
you're okay .
okay .

no wait .
though this might be .
i think this one's kind of supposed to be a doctor baby .

okay .
i'm going to talk to mommy .
you can keep playing .
you can play with devon if you want okay ?
okay .
i play babies .
right .
keep going .
are you going to play babies .
do you remember what macy played with last time ?
i think it was the plates .
i think so .
did you notice any difference have you noticed even at home any differences with how she plays with things at home ?
not really .
she .
she's .
i don't know .
she's usually .
just .
like this like she'll get tired of a toy like .
within five seconds and go on to the next .
say .
hi !
is so is she still into toys rather than more so than books ?
no i have some books that .
i put in front of her that she likes .
they're like the huge .
books that have like .
million and one different like pictures of things and .
but she likes those books and then of course the ones that make noise .
so but .
and then .
she has a good night moon book .
it's not this one this ones the counting book but like .
the regular good night moon book that she likes .
okay .
so .
have how about so today she played with well what do you think was her like favorite thing ?
all this food stuff .
like .
a couple times she would grab the stuffed animals or i would try to .
introduce the stuffed animals or the book and .
so .
okay .
and do you think she recognized the names of any like any of the foods familiar ?
probably pizza .
because .
and as soon as she seen the pizza and picked it up she tried to eat it .
because she had pizza a few nights ago .
so .
i think she recognized and was like !
but .
other than that .
she eats peas but we don't really .
specifiy that .
she's eating peas at the moment .
but .
anything else .
other than .
the bottle .
i don't even know if i had said bottle but .
that would be the other really other thing she i think would understand what it was .
how about like the sundaes or the the co the icecream cone ?
she might recognize icecream .
because she gets icecream at home .
or like when we're out but .
i don't think we have it often enough for her to .
kinda put two and two together .
but that's a big treat though for her to get that .
do you have any similar toys at home ?
we don't have any of the food which i should probably get .
sh she has she has a bunch of stuffed animals but she really doesn't like to play with them at home either .
i would say probably the only thing that i know she has is the keys .
and she has a babydoll at home too but she's not really into the playing with babydolls stage yet i guess .
did she .
so .
today ?
kind of like i .
put it next to her and she kinda looked at it like .
what's going on but .
but .
and then like a couple seconds later she went back to it and was like pulling it towards here and .
like messing with it's hand .
so .
you're crawling all over the food .
it's slippery ?
having fun ?
you having fun ?
so you said you have the animals at home ?
does she know them like by name or is she familiar with the name at least ?
probably the only .
animal .
that she would know the name of other than dogs because have dogs or puppy .
like she knows the names of those .
and .
the only other one that like stuffed animal wise i think she would recognize is a bunny .
because she has a bunny that she plays with constantly at home .
like it not plays with she usually sleeps with it .
so .
but say i can't go to bed without my bunny .
do you think she's she's at home more interested in some categories ?
stuffed animals dolls food books like that ?
at home .
she probably likes more hard plastic toys the best .
like she'll look through books and like like she's reading .
but and then the stuffed animals but she doesn't .
really .
play with them like she'll play with them for a few minutes but she'll always go back to that hard plastic .
so .
is she eating soups at home or anything like brothy ?
not yet we've just started introducing a lot of foods so .
but like a couple weeks ago she had pizza and she's had .
she's had .
a lot of stuff actually i don't think though .
i've ever given her .
soup or anything like that .
so .
i was just bringing it up because i saw the .
so i was just thinking .
trying to formulate it in some way ?
so the food was a big success today and what do you think was the thing she went for the least ?
probably the books .
because every time and especially this book .
because i remember her kind of .
messing with it last ni either last time or the time before because of the little patches of hair but .
all of the books like i would put in front of her and she'd be like .
she's like there's food here .
how is she playing with the food what do you think she likes about the food ?
i don't know .
like a couple of times she would bang it together and then .
like with the peas .
she had like they when we got here they were on a plate like this .
and she picked them up played with them for a little bit tried to put them back on the plate .
and when that didn't work she tried to put it on the other side !
but .
and then .
other than that she .
you're losing all sorts of traction !
other than that i think she was just kinda holding them checking them out and .
banging them a little .
and throwing them !
that toy i handed it to her and she was like threw it over her shoulder i was like .
maybe cookie .
i mean she has like the little bitter biscuits that like melt in their mouth and we call them her cookies .
so she might recognize it but she doesn't get them often because they're so messy so .
other than that .
i don't think she really .
would recognize them or the name of them .
so .
no we don't eat a lot of bread type stuff in our house so .
she doesn't i don't think she's ever tried pancakes or waffles or bread or anything .
so .
alright .
okay well that's it for the line of questioning today .
alright .
okay .
let's stop there .
okay .
she kept looking up at you guys like why won't you play with me and smile ?
really ?
mean sitting in the corner .
okay .
let's see .
so which group of toys did she seem interested in ?
i think definitely the play food was her favorite .
play food ?
did she like any specific ones ?
she liked the pizza .
liked the pizza a lot .
the pasta .
the peas .
the plate .
you going to say hi ?
she liked the the pitcher and the spoon .
she played with that a lot .
and the carrot soup .
she liked .
okay .
would you would she recognize any of these do you think ?
she recognized i think the peas because we we've had peas the past couple nights .
pizza she i don't know if she would necessarily recognize the shape per say because we cut it up but you know i've said you know this is she's had pizza before i've cut up .
and bread .
you know she knows her bread and we just had pasta for the first time too this week so i think she .
okay .
so why would you say she likes this group ?
i mean she did play with the frog too she liked the frog .
and the eagle she played with .
i think it's because we really don't have any play food at home so it's something new different .
okay .
interesting .
we we asked for some for your birthday right ?
so .
but i think that that was the main reason .
because she loves she has plenty of books at home and loves her books at home .
you know she'll take them all off her shelf and flip through them and .
and she has some stuffed animals but they're really you know she could take them or leave them .
do you have any of the books we have ?
we have goodnight moon but not in the board book .
we have the foot book and mister brown .
and we have a karen katz book but not the baby peekaboo .
okay .
let's see .
so which would you say she was least interested in ?
the books or ?
i guess the books .
i tried to read her peekaboo and she was like .
okay .
do you think there're any other items she'd recognize the name of ?
definitely cheese .
she loves cheese so she would recognize the cheese the pizza the peas the bread .
icecream .
you haven't had icecream .
one day you'll know what that is .
got the keys ?
we have keys at home .
hi !
what about the animals would she recognize names of or ?
she recognized some of them .
you know we talked about frogs and she has some books about frogs or that have frogs in them .
you know the bumblebee she would recognize the name .
okay .
and you said you have .
you answered that question .
would you say she prefers toys or books now ?
at home .
at home i mean it's it's pretty much a fifty fifty split .
like in when we play in the living room we have all of her toys and she has some books there but when we're in her room she has a lot more books and she'll play you know she'll take all the books of her shelf and .
so it's pretty split .
you know it depends on where we are and what she's in the mood for but .
okay .
you got it .
you know how to eat it .
you know how to eat it .
what about the doll .
did she .
didn't even go near it .
no ?
does she have any dolls at home ?
not like that no .
she has like a a more of a stuffed doll .
that you know but not but she doesn't have like a real babydoll .
okay .
okay i think that's it .
unless is there anything you want to tell us like does she have a favorite toy at home or anything ?
ball maybe ?
she does like she has a couple of balls she does like to to chase those around and watch them roll .
she likes right now we have like she loves her cups you know like the stacking cups and the rings .
you know she's she's putting on the rings and things .
she really liked the pitcher .
and the spoon .
okay i think we're all set then .
okay .
great .
you did a good job !
say thank you .
we can turn everything off .
did she get her prize already ?
yes .
yes we did .
she got a book .
have you noticed .
this visit that he was .
that he have different interests .
in different toys or .
some kinds ?
he seemed to .
he seemed .
have a maybe longer attention span .
with a few of them .
food .
okay .
he's getting .
to eat more .
like finger food table food .
okay .
kind of stuff so .
i thought he was .
most interested in the food you'd say ?
i think so .
okay .
do you think he'd recognize ?
any of the foods we have here ?
any of the names of them ?
the peas he's had .
fairly frequently .
so that might be when .
he recognizes .
and maybe from last time .
i can't remember what .
food we played with last time .
but i know we played with some food .
it's been a while .
so .
do you guys have play food at home ?
we do .
okay .
alright .
so that's why okay .
which would you say he's least ?
interested in ?
which set ?
probably the stuffed animals i guess .
okay .
we don't have many .
because his older brother .
doesn't like them .
he seems to be a little bit interested .
so .
right you have a bird .
alright and .
do you ?
read books at home ?
okay .
do you have of the ones you have here ?
we have put me in the zoo and the foot book .
and we've gotten this one from the library a few times .
so would you say he's into toys ?
or books ?
now ?
mostly toys .
okay .
the books he's not so interested in .
looking through them he wants to close them .
haha .
you're two on them .
what about ?
what about the doll did he like the doll ?
at all ?
he was didn't seem very interested .
no .
you have any of those at home ?
we have one .
but it's his brothers .
okay .
so he doesn't .
i do not know .
he doesn't see it much .
play with it .
okay .
okay .
do you think he'd recognize any of the ?
animals ?
you have ?
maybe ?
the names of them ?
we just went to the .
fair .
so we saw a bunch of .
like farm animals i don't see any .
farm animals .
do you think he would know a dog ?
he might .
i don't know that .
those look like any of the dogs ha .
haha .
he has seen .
okay .
okay .
i think that's it .
plus is there anything you can think of ?
that he plays at home ?
we have a lot of cars .
and trucks .
and trains and all that .
and he he seems very interested in them .
pushing them around .
right .
okay i think .
he's started to enjoy puzzles .
just .
taking the pieces out .
trying to put them back .
okay .
either while he's standing or sitting down .
so .
alright .
combing .
what he's able to do .
you know ?
right .
okay .
i think we're all set then .
okay .
did you guys get a prize ?
we did .
no .
want to play with erica ?
come on .
while i talk to mommy .
okay .
has there been anything you've noticed has changed since the last time that you were here ?
i think the last time she really liked the doll and this time she i don't think she could have cared less .
about the doll .
she was like really into the doll .
she was holding her hand and everything .
this time she didn't care .
so which toys do you think she was most interested in this time ?
all the food .
the food toys .
maybe she's hungry ?
maybe .
could be .
i don't know .
she was really into the food toys and she loves this gross thing .
the hair is gross but i guess its cool it feels cool .
which toys do you think she has the least interested in besides the doll ?
like just the little animals in general .
she kinda just picked them up and threw them .
and then .
she got into the books at the end .
so i would say these stuffed animals .
does she play with similar toys at home ?
we have food toys .
and i don't have little stuffed animals really .
a couple but not many .
but she we play with this these similar ones at home .
and any of the books ?
do you have any of these books at home ?
no .
i don't have these same books but we have a lot of books .
and she always she likes to look through them .
which book do you think she was most interested today ?
she liked this one .
the pee the peekaboo one .
do you think there are any items here that she would recognize the name of ?
doggie .
she knows doggie and baby .
the little baby but she didn't .
say it .
she usually calls her doll a baby .
what about any of the food items ?
that she would recognize the name of but she doesn't i know how to say the word yet .
so you use the words at home ?
like if i say spaghetti she'll look at the spaghetti .
okay .
try to say it .
do you think that she prefers books or toys in general ?
i think she likes both ?
i don't know which one she prefers .
i guess toys .
if i hadta pick one .
kim, did you say you have any dolls at home ?
we have a doll sorry .
we have a doll .
a couple dolls .
we have a baby doll and then like you know little animal dolls .
look !
look .
is there anything that you think we should know about her play ?
nope .
nothing special sorry .
we ruined your .
it's okay .
i think it's fixable .
it is .
look at this guy .
this gross guy .
he's got like hair .
like real hair .
it's like stuck to the gummy hair .
its gross .
we tried to clean them off .
i know .
i know .
that's it .
i think similar to last time she's just really into the pizza .
i guess the pizza's pretty .
it's got a lot of colors .
right .
okay the only the question i have for you is we won't see her again until she is around two .
would you like called for other studies in between ?
sure sure .
i don't know of i can come to all of them but .
of course .
you have the option anytime to decline and we keep you on the list .
okay .
so you'll call me when she is ready to come back for the .
either our lab or there are three other labs on campus .
so it could be any of those labs too .
okay .
is that the last one ?
or is that just one of the series ?
of studies of tests in this one .
this test this study is only four so that's we'll call you when she's at two .
that's the last one .
okay and then but we .
that's awhile .
but we have studies here for all ages .
and the other labs as well .
it was kinda fun .
so what was he most interested in ?
standing up .
the peas of course .
every time the peas have been his favorite .
it's the food that he recognizes the most .
he eats peas he likes peas a lot .
but i think they're also very chewy .
the texture to chew them and such .
the waffles .
he likes the waffles .
not for very long though .
was he interested in any other of the foods ?
he looked at the pizza and the spaghetti .
that's about it today .
and this can thing .
what is that ?
what have you got ?
did you show .
he just likes the way he can hold it and drop it .
that one he doesn't really chew it .
he just holds it and drops it .
did you show him any of the animals ?
i did .
i showed him the bee and the sheep and the kangaroo .
but mostly he just liked that this had eyes that he could bite .
we don't have to be at home right now so he doesn't .
know what they are .
but they do .
so what was the what was the game you were playing with him with the ?
peas on the head ?
well first it was all fall down because he likes to drop things .
and so .
like .
before we were .
we .
like he likes to do it in the bathtub and stuff like that .
like he just picks something up and drops it .
over something or around something .
and so we're just calling it all fall down .
and then he started falling down .
and then i was putting peas on our heads and they were falling down .
and peas in the mouth and it fell down too .
was there anything he was interested last time that he didn't go for this time ?
he did more of the food last time .
this time he was more happy standing up .
and he usually goes goes and pulls her hair for a little bit but he didn't do that this time .
here's the ice cream cone .
that's the only thing baby dolls are good for for him .
you can pull their hair without them getting mad at you ?
he likes to pull hair .
and bite .
so have you guys do you guys have a lot of these toys at home or ?
we have some spoons and plates and not really many food toys like that .
so we have the bottle .
lots of stuffed animals but .
he doesn't play with those as much lots of little stuff animals .
my daughter plays with those more than him .
and we have a babydoll like that .
we have a couple babydolls for my daughter but .
does he like it when you read to him ?
he usually .
we usually do one book for him and the rest he just sits through his siblings' books .
he just listens to their books too .
what kinda books do you read to him ?
he likes the touch and feel ones a lot .
and ones with baby pictures .
and we have some little ones that are little tiny ones that he likes to carry around .
but he mostly listens pretty well to theirs actually .
just because he's got the lap and he likes to keep his his throne .
are you a good listener ?
it's good to be a good listener .
okay .
well we are done with this part .
okay .
you see ?
you can play .
i think i'll talk to your mom .
talk to your mom .
that's her .
that's right that's your mom .
well i don't know how long ago it was that you came for the second visit but .
it was like a month .
okay so maybe there have been some changes i do not know .
that you noticed with what he likes to play with or how he's playing with .
toys .
i'm not going to write this down .
just going to capture it .
i think he's starting to learn what things are a little bit more .
so you know he might've known that this kind of stuff is food i do not know .
we don't have any toys like this at home .
any of the food toys .
so it's different for him .
i mean he plays when we're in the kitchen he plays with the spoons and the spatulas and .
but otherwise we don't have any of the play foods so that's sorta new to him .
okay so he did he seem to like that a lot ?
i mean i would point out the animals and he didn't even seem to care about those as much .
you like th the food and everything .
did he have any favorite foods ?
he kept grabbing the .
the pizza and the hamburger he kept going for .
he did .
he really liked that pizza .
but it doesn't look so much like a real thing do you think he ?
i don't think he thinks i i don't know that he would know that it's real pizza .
i mean all he's ever had is a crust with pizza anyways .
so he's never really seen it .
for some reason he liked it .
why do you think he liked those ?
hamburger and pizza .
i do not know he's always liked things that are red in color .
i do not know if that has anything to do with it that's a complete guess .
because then this is sorta boring looking in comparison so .
but he liked that ?
he liked it he was holding on to this like the whole time .
okay .
let's see .
so would you say the food interested him the most of all the toys ?
definitely .
where you going alex ?
which things do you think interested him the least ?
you can go find your car .
i think the books .
he likes books at home but usually it's when he's quiet .
and we're sitting .
and napping .
so for him that was just too slow .
okay .
so he wasn't as interested .
he definitely seemed to be interested in the baby .
but then as soon as you brought it over he was you know .
he thought it was neat .
but .
he noticed it or something .
he definitely noticed it .
you noticed the baby interesting .
but maybe doesn't know how to play with it .
hi .
that's interesting .
a lot of kids seem to be interested in the facial features of the baby .
where's the nose ?
where's the nose ?
where's the nose ?
how about any of these ?
he definitely he he remembered this from last time .
and that's completely because of the the head .
i think he loves loves this texture .
okay .
so .
this he recognized and this he loved .
mom says you like that .
bee .
were there i think i heard animal names and sounds but i wasn't sure if they were these animals i .
i mean i did a horse sound and a doggie sound .
and then you know we did all the sounds in this .
in that maybe that was what i was .
those are farm ones .
and so he knows all the farm animals he knows his rubber duckie at home .
does he make the noises yet ?
no no .
but he definitely knows when he takes his bath he knows his rubber duckies .
and he has this little crab .
and if i say where's the crab he gives me the crab .
so he knows what they are .
so he knows what that means interesting okay .
and you pair the sound with the animal .
so .
i do it often .
so he would pick up on it .
and i asked you about differences from last time .
no over here .
they all like that .
i'll have to get a different system for when they get older like you .
what did i say no .
you can play over here .
that feels good .
that feels really good .
do you think overall he prefers toys or books at this point .
at this point toys .
okay alright .
and do you know what qualities about toys you would say that attract hi attract him ?
you mentioned color .
i think the texture is probably bigger than anything .
because he likes to put things in his mouth .
you know so he was holding the things that are softer .
versus .
versus really hard .
he wasn't as much .
i mean that's a guess .
he has lots of blocks at home so i was sorta doing blocks with that .
you're smiling about that .
and do you have any dolls at home ?
you know they're all not baby dolls they're animals .
so there's like a big puppy big bear but actually no baby .
so maybe that was a little it's a little different from what he's used to .
no we fed alex .
he fed himself .
so he liked drinking from this .
except he i think he was disappointed there was no water in it .
and he ate with a spoon .
he did very nice .
well sort of .
he pretended right ?
so do you think he recognizes any of the any of the object names for any of these yet ?
of what's here i think he might have recognized this .
when i called it do you want a drink do you want water .
i don't use the term cup very often actually .
so he definitely recognized that .
he might've recognized spoon .
but i'm not sure .
it seems like you played with a variety of things though .
you got around to atl at least offering most of these kinds of toys .
that's great .
that is great .
i think that's all i needta ask you at this point .
unless there's anything you noticed that you thought was kind of interesting for us to know .
i don't think so .
i thought it was odd how he was sitting still the whole time at home he never sits still .
he's always all over the place .
he was right in that frame the whole time .
i said you want to see the bee and he just sort of stared .
he didn't really go for it .
so .
okay well i think that's all i need .
okay .
and then you're going to come back at when he's two .
big difference .
okay .
i'm just going to ask you a few questions .
okay .
i see the lights .
he can play with the toys if he still wants while we're .
okay .
asking some questions .
which of the toys .
seem to interest cayden the most ?
well he played with this bee for a long time .
and the baby .
and the books a little bit .
hi !
come get me !
okay .
which ones do think interest him .
the least .
and why ?
he didn't seem that interested in .
a lot of the stuff animals .
he doesn't really seem interested in them at home either .
so i do not know .
why he not just .
i know !
he just doesn't .
doesn't really capture his interest very much .
shh .
i know .
and the food he didn't play with .
today .
and i'm surprised because .
shh .
because we have a lot of .
food type .
toys at home .
i know you're hungry .
okay hold on .
so i would've thought that maybe he'd play with those a little more .
okay .
shh .
you know what ?
i know your hungry hold on ha .
okay hold on .
i'll feed you in a minute haha .
okay .
hold on .
so do you think any of the items .
that cayden's been interested maybe have changed since .
the last time you were here ?
last time he was all over .
the waffles and the pizza .
and i thought it was .
i thought because it was similar to what we had at home .
he seemed more willing to explore .
more unfamiliar toys this time .
okay .
i know your hungry .
what would cayden probably prefer to look at with you ?
sorry ?
what kind of books do you think cayden would prefer ?
he likes to look at the kinda where the .
either .
the pages .
flip open like .
you know they're folded over .
and then they flip open .
or they have little flaps that open .
he really likes the .
open and close ones .
but he also liked that one with the texture .
too .
ow !
my goodness your nails are sharp !
does cayden play with some more toys at home ?
pretty similar pretty similar .
we don't have a lot of babies .
but he has a sister so .
sorta the same idea haha .
haha .
he does like to .
get on on her and give her kisses like that so .
good job .
your big on pieces .
books or toys ?
i think toys .
but he seems a lot more interested .
in .
in .
in books lately .
just the last month or so .
i've really seen him .
kinda get interested in looking at books .
more and all .
even when he's playing independently now he'll look at books where before he would always play with toys .
okay .
okay .
i mean you said that you do have pretend food at home .
does cayden play with the pretend food at home ?
he does he loves it .
do you think .
he recognizes any of the foods from the last time ?
that he was here or maybe some of them from home ?
he might .
we do have a little juice thing .
like the one he was playing with like this one .
so that one is exactly the same .
so that one's really familiar .
we don't have the bread but he does .
eat sandwiches .
so haha .
okay .
ha that could be the connection .
what are you doing putting that on top ?
cayden recognizes any of the names ?
of any of these ?
or other items or maybe he's beginning to .
i feel that he is .
beginning to get .
sometimes i'll say .
do you see the .
fishy or something and .
he might not necessarily go get it but i kinda see his eyes going toward it .
okay .
so .
a few things .
more he recognizes people .
than things .
hi .
that hurts when you pinch .
okay .
are you hungry you want to eat ?
i'll let you go eat .
haha .
ha want to eat now or go eat in the car ?
okay .
he's a good boy he just got hungry .
haha .
totally understandable .
now i don't do you remember what he primarily played with last time you were here ?
it was i think he did more of the stuffed animals .
and the baby .
he always goes to the baby .
do you think he remembers it in particular ?
he has one at home .
so i don't know if he remembers this particular baby .
but he does have a doll at home that he likes to play with so .
are there other things here that are like what you have at home ?
he has some stuffed animals .
but he doesn't really pay much attention to them .
he has books at home .
that he likes .
to look through .
and he'll listen to a short story usually .
the plates .
did he play as much with the food items before ?
no .
he didn't .
i think he spent more time today with the food items than he did previously .
do you think there's anything there that he'd recognize ?
no .
probably not because he's not a good eater .
so he .
no the only thing i he did seem to he could kinda match if i shh you know showed him .
he did like to hold things that were the same .
but i don't think he really knows what they are because he really doesn't he's not a good .
eater .
so mostly looking for things that came for which there were there were pairs .
or were similar in shape i think .
he had you know or you know like he would pick up the two spoons or .
where you going ?
do you think there was anything else among those that made them particularly interesting ?
of the foods i think well the bottle because he's used to those .
so he did that .
and i think to put the cookie in here .
he was trying to get it out .
but i think it kinda frustrated him a little bit that he couldn't get it out .
connor .
not yours .
connor .
connor .
come here .
hi .
come here .
not yours .
come here .
connor .
you coming ?
you want that box ?
see the stickers ?
were there particular books that that you also have at home or that you think he'd be familiar with ?
no .
he doesn't have .
he has the foot book at home .
but he doesn't really .
he is more interested in books with real babies in them .
things like that .
or pictures of real animals he seems to focus on more .
than drawings .
okay .
and all of those are .
that seems to be what he's doing now .
cookie .
have you noticed a change in the way he plays with toys at home ?
he seems to be it's more purposeful now .
you know he's putting things in taking things out .
he has a stacked ring thing now that he puts things he'll put the rings on .
and also more frustration .
like if he has a train that balls go in he'll try to put blocks in it .
if they don't go in it makes him angry .
if he can't put stack things on the rings that makes him angry .
so .
i think he's more purposeful .
he loves balls .
and he's starting to chase after them .
and he'll try to throw them a little bit .
so i think it's more purposeful .
kind of play .
he's always been a pretty good .
player .
he can play .
can keep himself occupied for pretty you know a pretty good amount of time with toys and things just on the floor .
when we when you first started playing with the food items i know you pulled out particularly the can .
he likes to sta he usually likes things to be stacked .
and he does like to play with like real soda cans and things like that or water bottles .
he'll go and pull them out and play with them .
i don't know if it's the so the water in them he likes to shake and kinda maneuver them .
that's cheese .
where you going ?
my goodness .
come back here .
no .
no .
look .
you want that ?
that's okay ?
it'll pull out completely actually .
you going to pull it out ?
i wouldn't trust it as sturdy enough to try using to stand on .
okay .
but .
but it's fine if he tries playing with it .
you want to take those out ?
you gotta pull hard .
pull hard .
you want to put it back in ?
want to push it in ?
want to push it .
there it goes .
you got it .
does he have a lot of toys at home that make noise ?
yes .
a lot of things that he can shake .
balls and things like that .
and also .
like puppies that will talk or make noise .
that kinda .
electronic ?
electronic type things .
a few of those .
remotes that you know you can push buttons and they'll make sounds .
you going to move it ?
what you trying to do ?
you want it out of the way ?
out of the way .
get another one ?
you're going to have to move back .
i was worrying about that one .
i thought you were going to pull so hard you would fall back .
you taking it out or putting it in ?
that's two .
now there were some things that there were pairs of that you didn't play with .
what's the matter ?
you don't want it there ?
he didn't go for the two slices of bread for example .
no he didn't .
do you think there was something about the ones he did go for ?
they were smaller maybe and easier for him to hold i guess .
because it did seem to be like the peas and the .
i don't know .
where you going ?
i don't know .
it didn't .
or maybe the color .
i don't know if they were more colorful .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
there's another one .
going to go get the other one ?
i was going to say it almost seemed like he was going for the softer ?
it ma .
it may be .
these are definitely harder .
things he could squeeze a little bit .
no not up there .
no .
no .
what ?
what do you want ?
thought you wanted that last bin .
you don't want the last bin ?
okay .
get the last bin ?
where you going ?
you can get the bin from this side .
you're busy .
no you don't need those .
no .
no .
no .
i know .
no .
no .
no .
no .
what ?
you say hi ?
what's that ?
is that your waffle ?
i think last time he did play a lot with that .
he was interested in the holes .
he kinda .
the indentations in it for some reason .
does he have anything like that at home ?
no .
i assume he doesn't eat real .
no he's not a good eater .
other than .
as table foods go he'll eat pieces of bread and cheerios but .
not good with things like spaghetti .
there's the bread .
anything else you particularly noticed either about what he was playing with today or what he seemed interested in or .
what he does at home ?
no .
what his favorites are ?
as far as toys here ?
i stll i think it .
he seemed to spend a lot more time with the foods than he did usually .
you know the bottle and the cup i think because he's used to them at home he .
put those .
you know to him .
going for those pens .
you like pens too don't you ?
no .
that can break .
that can break .
that can break .
there's your baby .
baby .
give the baby hugs ?
yes .
that's a bigger baby than your baby isn't it ?
he has a baby .
there's a .
hugs for the baby .
headbutt the baby ?
baby's ear .
say hi baby .
give baby kisses ?
hi baby .
done with baby ?
you all finished with her ?
look .
baby's got shoes .
baby's got shoes .
that baby's got shoes .
unlike you .
yes .
that's another thing you like to play with though shoes .
you like shoes don't you ?
no you don't have shoes do you ?
you just have feet .
just your feet .
you wrestling with the baby ?
well as you know this is the the third and last for a while .
okay .
the next visit isn't until he turns two .
so you've still got a ways until you come back for another one of these .
at that point it will be basically a series of language assessments and .
working memory tests and a whole bunch of things .
so that we can see as well as some social stuff .
no no .
as well as some assessments of kind of again what kinds of things he's interested in social skills cognitive skills .
connor .
no .
how about going back over this way .
come this way .
what ?
stop .
keep moving .
shoes .
you got a can ?
okay .
well what do you think ?
should we go in the room and get you a toy for participating today ?
don't worry about them .
are you sure ?
because i'll take them out to put other stuff in .
that's where they store everything .
you were going to take it out anyway ?
you going to take it out anyway ?
that's a big bin ?
that's a big bin .
want to put them in ?
alright so what do you think his favorite toy was this time ?
besides the camera and the cord .
i think .
the sippycup and the spoon were the two that he seemed to play with the most .
why do you think so ?
i think he's hungry .
it's he's ready for lunch .
gotcha .
he always tries to take the spoon out of my hand and play with it and then and he's he hasn't had anything to drink in a little bit so he's probably just hungry and thirsty .
do you think he recognizes those things ?
yes .
yes definitely .
i bet a lot of it he probably doesn't recognize but the sippycup and the spoon and the bottle .
i think he definitely does .
and he loved the icecream cones last time and this time and so i don't know .
if he recognizes them or not or if he just likes to chew on them .
you know what i mean like he likes the shape of them or whatever so .
because we don't usually get this kind of cone .
but .
so he always he's always always gravitates towards plastic toys he's never been into the stuffed animals he'll play with books at home .
mostly to take them off the shelf and throw them but .
the stuffed animals he's never interested in .
okay .
maybe the pizza .
and the cheese .
i'm going to say that's probably i don't know that's probably about it .
so what did he like last time you said the icecream .
the icecream cones .
the icecream cones and the icecream sundae well and he might and you know what he might recognize those like that's been one of his favorite things lately is when we eat icecream he loves to have some .
so .
so i think maybe he might recognize the icecream .
and that doesn't really look like pasta so i don't know if he'd recognize that .
i agree .
maybe the bread .
he's we've started giving him bread lately .
so .
do you think he recognizes any of the stuffed animals ?
i don't think so i mean we read books and talk you know i'll point out animals and stuff he doesn't seem to be real engaged .
he likes to play with those little farm toys but he doesn't real interest like he doesn't seem real interested in stuffed animals and so it's hard to tell .
he likes when we make noises and stuff but then he's like kinda done with it .
right so .
and i think he likes to play with the eyes on the doll .
which makes me nervous because my sister's getting ready to have a baby .
and he'll poke the baby in the eye .
man .
that's why i always try to treat dolls like real kids .
hi .
how's that spoon ?
say it better food on it .
you are hungry .
and he's still teething so he has no teeth yet so he chews on anything he can get in his mouth .
and i think that's part of the reason he likes to play with the pla the hard toys compared to the soft toys .
because he's never played with soft toys .
that makes sense .
gentle nathan remember ?
look gentle there you go good job .
not in the eye though .
you're a good listener .
do you use a lot of words of encouragement when he does something right or .
i mean i try to i try to .
unfortunately you know most of the time he ends up going for the outlet or the video camera or the cord or the you know so he spends a lot of time doing that so i'll we we try to look out for that and and do as much words of encouragement as we can .
does he gravitate towards toys that make noise ?
he likes them but that's not like the only he'll play with like .
we try you know and it's funny because i think when i think about it i think all of our noise making toys are in one room and like all of his other toys you know what i mean and like not on purpose i think that's just how it worked out but .
nathan no !
and you're going to try to cr crawl climb up that aren't you ?
come here come see mama .
i'm going to get you !
ooh .
good boy .
he does like he does like toys that make noise but .
like there's some toys when we turn them off he enjoys them just as much when they're not making noise so he likes to play with a lot of stuff that doesn't make noise too .
so it's probably half and half .
so do you think he likes certain toys certain colors or textures ?
definitely like hard plastic better than like soft stuff .
i'm trying to think if we've got like wood toys or anything like that .
he definitely likes bumpy stuff if something's got like a you know some kind of pattern texture on it he likes that .
i'm trying to think of what else .
nathan .
stop .
i think that that's probably the most of it and he likes he likes chewing on board books he likes chewing on paper he loves chewing on paper .
that's always a challenge because he tries to choke on that too .
but i think mostly just the the harder toys and then if there's like a bumpy some soft of bumpy texture on it he likes that .
basically anything that feels good on his gums .
is is really wants to but he's started like he has a shape sorter at home .
and he loves playing with that and he started putting shapes into the box and trying to put it through the right holes .
he never quite gets them the right direction but like he'll put the circle over the circle hole and .
you know and so i think he's starting to get that like different shapes and and stuff like that he's starting to learn that .
and he's figured out he loves he has a little people barn and like there's certain doors that open and close that make noises and stuff and he loves moving he's figured out how to move all the things that makes noise and he likes to do that .
that's really good .
then he also likes to just carry the little people around with him and chew on them and whatever .
and he'll put like he'll definitely put stuff in and take stuff out of of buckets and he's got a train that's got like the balls that come out of the top and he'll grab them and he'll put them back in and .
so .
he the putting in and taking out has been his latest favorite thing to do .
i wanted to ask if you remember what his favorite toy was on the first visit .
the first visit he was just kinda playing with all of the food toys .
and i think it was like i don't know if it was this one but it was like one of these like i think rectangular kind of things .
maybe like this one because he was probably smaller then .
but it was just i think it was one of these little things i don't know .
i think it was just one of these .
ooh you know actually you know what it was it was i think there was like a can of peas or maybe this .
i think this like one of these things .
good .
so he's been consistent with the food .
and i think now he's starting to recognize more of it too since he's eating more like real food .
so .
alright .
he definitely gets excited when we get when we pull a cracker out like he recognizes the package of crackers .
and he's like like i was putting it in the diaper bag earlier and i thought he was going to jump out of his skin and then he's like what you're not giving me one ?
so .
that's funny .
alright so that's all the questions i have .
and then he doesn't come back until he's two or something right ?
okay !
keep playing .
keep licking everything .
the clock .
do you need me to leave this on ?
okay .
that way i don't have to write anything down .
so have you noticed any changes since the last time ?
that you were here in terms of his interest in the toys or ?
interest in toys ?
these toys ?
no he's pretty much was drawn to the exact same things .
he has no interest in the in the stuffed animals .
gavin look at all these toys over here !
i'd rather play with the person .
sure .
okay so he's drawn to the same things you said as last time .
no interest in these ?
he starts usually with the books .
then he usually winds up on these things .
okay so he was somewhat interested in the books ?
somewhat .
i mean he he picked up one .
and then he threw it away .
okay and that was about .
the same as last time ?
okay so you think you think he really .
both times preferred the food and dishes ?
and we've started at home now incorporating books into like his play times too .
so he can just .
like we did like the touch and feel books so .
so i thought he might be more interested in them .
but he picked up that one and then .
i mean he's still interested in things he can stick in his mouth so .
so would you say that could be a reason why he likes those other things ?
i think so .
okay .
well and there's there's jus there's variety .
and there's there's things to explore in them .
different textures .
things like that so .
some of them make noise ?
they make noise .
they move .
they resemble things he's familiar with like the bottle .
and .
right i was going to ask about that so .
i mean he's never had pizza .
he's never had spaghetti .
and when he eats peas they don't look like this .
and his waffles don't really look like this .
they're cut up but .
so maybe the bottle .
is the most realistic looking thing ?
i mean because that he put in his mouth the appropriate way and .
okay .
and the sp i mean he recognized the spoons .
spoons mean food to him so .
particularly this spoon .
this one was more like a shaky thing .
but this one was more like a spoon to put in his mouth .
so he likes doing that .
and he did the right thing with it ?
okay so you recognize those things .
right gavin ?
alright .
which .
what he did different this time compared to last time he was did a little bit more copying .
which he had never really done before .
like i shook that .
and then he shook these .
so he's done that a little bit more .
interesting .
was there any other kind of copying that he was doing .
today ?
i mean for the most part i was f following him .
i was letting him lead but .
and then that seemed to engage him ?
when you did that ?
i mean that's how i let him play at home .
i let him kinda have free reign .
i don't really direct his his play yet .
i mean .
so go ahead .
like .
i'll stack blocks or something to get him interested in them .
but i usually let him .
just do what .
j do what he wants to do .
and at home if you did the same thing that you did here sort of copy what he does .
is he noticing that more ?
engaged with that more ?
absolutely .
at home too ?
like if i'm if i shake a rattle he'll shake one too .
or he'll come over and pick one up and shake it .
often what he does if i'm shaking something he'll come and take it outta my hand .
and do what i was doing .
and then i'll pick up another one and do it with him .
okay so it's a back and forth kinda thing you're doing .
gavin .
i hear him talking .
so would you say the same as last time that these were the toys that interested him the least today ?
same as last time ?
sure .
because he'll just eat that .
paper .
it should be able to come with you if you want to move around with it .
he's a paper loving guy ?
here you want to book ?
he can play with this now right ?
like with that car that he got last time .
after he saw me move it back and forth then he would start to move it back and forth too .
gavin look !
it's this way .
which way does it go ?
hah here it comes !
and .
show her how it works !
no no wires .
so you may have already as answered this but .
are there any items that you think his interest has changed around ?
between the last time and this time ?
this toys here ?
no .
no okay .
we're not going to play with the wires thank you .
we're going to play over here .
okay and which book of these do you think he would prefer ?
the one with the touch and feel one .
and did you play with any similar kinds of toys like these at home ?
just the books but .
we still don't do any pretend toys .
we just use stuffed animals really to distract him like when we're changing his diaper and stuff like that .
he doesn't really play with .
does he ?
i guess in his in his toy box he has like a stuffed cookie monster or and an elmo .
that he sometimes plays with .
but it's not a preferred thing .
we usually .
it's not a preferred thing .
and does he play with any dolls at home ?
just those stuffed animals .
we don't have a doll at home .
although i did think about getting one after the last time we were here haha .
he seemed interested in the baby this time ?
he was more interested in it last time i think .
now he just wants to lick the face .
and i i know we asked you this last time .
but i don't remember what you said .
d do you think he recognized any of those besides the bottle and the spoon ?
you found our microphone !
no there's nothing else there that .
you can move over this way .
that he would have .
had .
okay and okay and last question .
do you think there were any toys any of these items that he would recognize the names of yet ?
book or story maybe .
okay .
but you know a lot of the questions that are in the developmental questionnaires about asking if he recognizes words .
it's hard to know because so much of what we do is part of a routine .
you know when we go and sit down in the in the rocking chair that's when we're reading .
so he knows .
we're reading .
right .
there's one book that he's started to recognize that he actually says something when he sees .
he has the book baa .
it's the sandra boyton book .
and when he sees it he goes ".
lala .
so .
you know that ?
so he knows that book .
but .
and then are there .
so that's that you answered my next question .
if there any th any items at home that you think he would recognize that he doesn't have here .
so that particular book .
by the name of it ?
by the name of it .
it's so hard to know what words he knows because we pair everything with gestures .
you know s i always it was so hard to fill out those questionnaires because there's very little .
that we do without a gesture with it .
you know when we say eat we're always saying eat or walking over to his highchair or showing him food .
when it's time for a we say and show him the bottle .
so you were having to take a guess but .
i'm taking a guess on a lot of things .
okay well that's fine .
i mean i think he recognizes animal sounds .
like and .
woof woof or whatever .
okay well that's great .
that's that's all we need .
just a general idea .
of .
but he's still right now this is i mean his main thing now is just gross motor things .
and he's just learned how to climb .
and that's really what he wants to do .
it'll be interesting to see what he's like when he comes back in two years .
hopefully he's talking when he's two !
he comes back in two years .
or he comes back when he's two ?
when he's two .
so about a year .
so i can go ahead and turn this off .
okay so let's find out what do you think if anything is different about the kinds of things he liked today versus last time ?
i think i remember last time him throwing a lot of stuff .
he really didn't want anything at all .
he wanted the baby he played the baby and he threw everything else .
this time he's actually picking up more than one thing at a time .
and he wasn't doing that before either on when we did the play thing as far as i can remember .
okay .
he's more interested in the other things and not just because he can put them in his mouth .
but he's actually like using the spoon the way it's supposed to be used to feed the baby and .
he's playing differently as well .
definitely .
that's those are big changes .
it's amazing just a couple weeks how it can make such a change .
i know .
we don't have any play food at home .
i was going to ask you of these toys do you have stuffed animals babydolls ?
no .
books ?
we have some stuffed animals .
we have books .
we really only have books like in his bedroom .
i have a book downstairs but he never never like plays with it downstairs .
when he's in his bedroom and we're sitting in his rocker he grabs for his books and wants me to read to him .
okay .
are these any of these books the same as you have at home or similar ?
in other words would he recognize any of these ?
we have one that's similar to that fuzzy book .
so .
and we have the foot book but he that's one of the ones he closes every time i try to read it to him .
he has a couple favorites that he wants to read all the time .
okay .
do you remember what those are ?
baa la la la .
and the other one is a a book similar to that but it's like fuzzy animals .
those are the one's he likes to read .
it seemed like he liked animals .
does he know any animals ?
we .
does he know the names of them or sounds ?
we have four cats .
so he a lot of times he knows cats and he he makes the sound .
my mom has a lot of dogs so he knows doggie .
and we we do baby sign with him .
and he does this for the sign for doggie .
and sometimes he'll sorta kinda bark .
and does he know any like farm animals yet or does he do that stuff yet ?
no not .
i mean i started to to show him cows .
and chickens and sheep on a computer game that i have but he's kinda slightly interested .
i think maybe if they were the real thing he might be more interested .
i want to eventually take him somewhere where there are animals but i haven't gotten to it yet .
we went to the zoo when he was really little but that was more for just a moms outing than a babies outing .
these experiences kind of change as they get older .
yep .
well what kinds of toys do you think are best for his personality ?
well he likes the babydolls a lot .
and it seems like he really likes the food toys a lot .
so we might have to be getting some play food pretty soon .
it seemed like he was playing with several items .
do you think he recognizes any of these items ?
the waffle he .
well see we cut it up before we give it to him .
so he probably wouldn't necessarily recognize that .
same with the bread .
we cut it up before we give it to him .
i give him like grilled cheese sandwiches .
and i give him like cinnamon toast .
the spoon he would recognize .
the plate .
the pizza ?
no .
spaghetti peas any of those ?
peas maybe .
he does he throws them usually .
he doesn't really prefer .
he's he's really picky with food .
i might have to start trying pizza because he might actually eat pizza .
because he likes dif like he likes a lot of different flavors he doesn't like just plain old chicken .
he needs to have chicken with spices and stuff in it .
that's unusual .
he's .
does he like toys that make noise still ?
yep .
he likes things that he can shake that makes noise .
and what else was i looking at ?
the peekaboo type of book does he like that ?
at home he does .
but a lot of times if if it's not the two books that he likes the best he likes to clo .
but he still he likes to close that book too .
so but he we have one peekaboo book at home .
it's like a sesame street peekaboo that you lift things up and he seems to be tickled by that .
so he really likes the babydolls you said .
when we go to play group the little girl has babydolls and he's always going after them .
that and electronics .
it's just interesting because most of the kids his age have not don't really go for the babydoll .
at all .
you're unique .
the one the the one baby the the little girl is over a year she's like four thirteen or fourteen months .
and she carries around her babydoll and they kind of fight over it .
he'll rip it away from her and try to play with it .
and i gave him a cabbage patch kid at home .
and he he plays with that .
he definitely knows what it is .
when you say it .
yep .
and he started kissing him on his own .
at home .
it looked like he was feeding .
he was !
and i was like !
that's amazing .
you are amazing .
and he's walking already too .
you are ?
look my god he just stood up .
that that was the first time he's done that !
you stood up !
he's never stood up without holding on to something .
my gosh !
okay we need a plaque on the wall .
that's funny .
parker !
he took his first steps in the doctors appointment after he fell from the swing on our front porch .
it was the three of us in the swing and the whole swing went .
it was a front porch swing .
and it he fell backwards wound up fracturing the back of his skull .
and then the next day for our follow up appointment in the doctors office he walked for the first time .
like coup just like two steps but .
there goes the camera .
parker !
you come to momma .
i'm almost done i just needta scan to make sure there's nothing else i missed .
and he also likes balls a lot .
that's another thing because several people have mentioned that and we don't have any but that their children like them .
he he likes .
parker .
you like ball ?
look at mommy .
ball ?
ball ?
what do you like to do with it ?
he'll like toss it or throw it and you give it back to him he does does it back to you .
that's cool .
okay you don't have play food at home but you do have his cabbage patch doll .
no .
yep .
and you talked about recognizing .
which things do you think interested him the least ?
well he's scared of that still .
okay .
he seemed to be a little scared of the of this doggie for some reason i don't know if it's that fluff around his neck .
what are you doing buddy buds ?
the books at this point seem to not interest him as much as all the other toys .
could be because there's so many other choices .
i can't believe you !
i can't believe you're so silly !
alright i think that's all .
now i gotta call daddy and tell him the next step .
he he sat up from a laying down position really really early too .
he's been ahead of the game on the milestones .
okay .
do you mind if i ask you a few questions ?
sure .
okay .
not so much .
i mean i think he he kind of .
well he i think he maybe .
self-directed himself a little more .
in terms of he kind of moved through the toys .
more on his own i guess .
and .
you know i tried to let him do that to see what he was interested in .
but not not a heck of a lot of difference .
okay .
the toys that he chose to play with this time .
well he i think he likes more of those toys .
he's he's he's sort of somewhat interested in everything .
he was less interested i think in the books this time .
last time i think i tried to read him a book and this time i didn't .
he didn't seem very into it .
i mean i sort of did .
but he didn't seem into it at all .
he seemed actually kind of interested in this thing .
for for more than before .
i'm not really sure why .
and you know he seemed somewhat interested in the animals .
but i think those toys are a little more interesting to him in in general .
do you think he recognized the clock from home ?
no .
i don't think i think he wants to teeth on it actually .
i think it's the texture .
at first i thought he was trying to play peekaboo .
he's been doing that a lot lately .
like on the changing table he might .
pull up his onesie over his head and do peekaboo .
but he likes things obviously like that that are that make a little bit of noise .
and he is teething so .
i mean he's been he was last time too .
he has a lot of teeth .
and so i think he's looking also for a certain texture sometimes .
okay .
do you think he recognized the word clock ?
no .
no .
how about any of the other toys this time ?
do you think he recognized any of their names ?
you know i don't think so really .
because .
like we don't have like a fox at home .
i don't know .
honestly these are really difficult .
book maybe .
but .
doggie maybe .
but i'm not sure .
because like my my other son has a ton of stuffed animals .
but none of them look like that .
so i don't know if he recog .
do you know what i mean ?
like if he really recognizes the words .
i'm not sure .
i feel like he doesn't recognize a lot of words yet .
but i think he understands like intonation and and meaning more so .
like you know when when you're like don't touch that kind of thing versus like you know trying to be more like happy about something .
i think he understands that much more than than the words themselves .
okay .
that makes sense .
any foods .
that he might ?
well the peas that he eats are a little more pureed than that .
so i don't know .
i mean and we've started to obviously because he has you know good swallowing and chewing .
i've been trying to do some like mashed peas for him without the skin .
he might recognize them .
but .
i'm not really sure .
the waffle he has some wheat free ones that he has occasionally .
so he might recognize that .
but they're round not square .
so .
i don't know .
okay .
and how about at home ?
any changes in the toys that he's playing he's been playing with at home ?
you know not really .
the funny thing is actually like i feel like here .
maybe it's because there's it's quieter and less distractions but like he sat and played with all the toys .
and at home i feel like if you try to get him interested in something he'll want to go and like play with the dog's toys or go and like you know pull up the plants or something like that .
like he's much more into .
doing .
something else other than like kind of sitting here and playing with the different toys in a way even when you try to do that with him .
it's kind of funny .
i don't know .
okay .
how about any activities that you played .
i know you had .
that we do at home versus here ?
well or maybe that you did do here .
either one .
it doesn't have to be different than what you did here .
well we do similar things at .
at home .
like we might play with certain types of toys or try and read a book or play with like stuffed animals or things like that .
so i mean it's somewhat the same .
i mean a a lot of times like i say i think he's more active at home .
okay .
i think that's .
maybe what what do you think he was most interested in ?
i think those spoons at the end there actually .
that he was interested in that pitcher for a little bit and the spoons .
i think he liked trying to stick them stick them in his mouth .
and i think he liked the sound that they made and .
the fact that there was more than one of them .
but i think .
and a little bit with the the bee like when it bounced .
he smiled when i did that a little bit .
so .
but i think for himself i think the the spoons .
do you find you're using like a lot of sound effects at home when you like use animals and things because that's what he he likes sound effects ?
i'm not sure if i u .
i don't know if i u .
i mean i guess i do to some extent .
you know .
it's kinda fun watching him like trying to figure these things out and that kind of stuff .
i mean i think he i think he likes i think he likes being surprised sometimes .
like he loves playing peekaboo .
sometimes like you can really get him laughing .
and .
he has this clacker toy that it's it's a musical thing that he thinks it's hysterical .
i don't know why .
you know .
like .
but that's like one of the few things he responds to like that .
so i guess he does like .
he likes getting like you know raspberries on his on his skin and stuff like that .
he likes you know being sort of like held up and down kind of thing .
so i mean he .
i think he he sort of likes a diversity of activities i guess .
and at one point i could tell he was trying to make a poop .
that's okay .
so you think this time he he probably preferred the books least ?
i'd say least .
this time .
definitely .
seems to be liking that pile over there .
today he really seemed into it .
he also he's into throwing stuff too so .
and i'm not sure if he's doing it for the this part of it or to hear them like as they you know kind of crash together kind of thing .
right .
alright .
thank you very much for coming in .
we always appreciate it .
okay no problem .
normally it's like i'm trying to get him to you know stay out of trouble .
he was great .
okay i'm going to ask you some questions now .
okay .
about the play session you just had .
so what was the first thing that she went to ?
this .
big circle clock .
she bit on it .
like that .
do you think she knows that it's a is it familiar do you have anything like that at home or ?
we do but it's not foamy .
it's it's this color and it has the dials but it's not made out of this .
it's wood .
so but she does have a toy .
it's not a toy but she plays with it .
it's a real one .
it's for their play room so it's for kids but it's not something it's not soft like this one .
but it's the exact same colors .
so i don't know if she likes the texture of it if she likes the colors i'm not sure .
when i pretended it was a hat she threw it off so she i think she knows it's not a hat .
we pretended it was a plate and she just really just wanted to bite it .
now what did she go to after that ?
well i kind of pretended the frog was leaping on her and she kind of she was excited about the frog after .
he was pretending to kiss her neck .
she was laughing a little bit .
and then she went straight for the food .
which is what she did last time when we were here .
she likes the food .
specifically the peas .
but she didn't find those right away .
she played with the plates .
so something about circles maybe .
and she was playing with .
mostly playing with the plates at first and then i showed her that these were here and then this was all she really wanted to play with .
so i don't know if it's color or the tex .
i'm not sure what it is about these but she likes these .
she wasn't as interested in the baby this time .
in fact she didn't really seem to like the baby this time .
she didn't really interact much with her didn't want to feed her didn't want to hold her hair like she did before .
so last time she played with the baby ?
she did .
for quite a bit of time .
and she would feed it and do stuff like that .
she wasn't interested today .
maybe because i pretended she was my baby .
maybe .
do you have does she have like one like that at home ?
not that big but she does have babydolls .
okay .
and she plays with them sometimes .
did she play with the clock a lot last time too ?
i don't think she played with the clock before at all .
was it here ?
i don't she even noticed it before .
and the animals .
so does she have you said she really liked the frog .
she liked the frog .
shh no she doesn't have a frog at home .
she has a lot of stuffed animals but not i don't think she has one that looks like this .
she didn't seem interested in the rest of them .
she actually fed one of them .
she fed the fox her peas .
when i asked her if she'll give him some peas .
she fed them to her .
to the fox .
she wasn't interested in the donkey at all .
i thought the colors would bring her get her attention but she didn't seem interested .
and she played with this little bottle .
might remind her of her own bottle .
does she do a lot of play at home ?
she has a lot of toys little small toys that she plays with in her pack and play .
and then her and i will crawl around and play with different stuff .
she's got tons of toys .
she has three siblings that are like not much older than her .
so .
so are most of the toys that you have at home things like this that are imitations of real things or ?
we have play food and we have a a large play room in our basement and she and we have play food down there and she always goes straight to that .
i do not know if she knows if thinks it's real or if she just likes the texture .
i'm not sure but it all of course everything's in her mouth at this stage .
so i do not know if she thinks it's food or if she just wants to explore .
but she really likes the peas .
i don't know what it is about those peas .
and usually at home she likes noisy toys that make noise .
a lot of music type things .
we have a microphone toy that she sings in it she just puts it the whole thing in her almost in her mouth .
and she talks in it .
really loud into it .
it's a microphone so .
i think she likes to hear herself .
and that keeps her occupied .
and then any of the toys that have lots of lights and stuff on it she's excited .
kennedy .
what about the over there .
the the books .
you know i didn't really do anything with the books i think they're behind me i didn't even see them over here .
but we do have lots of books at home and lots of thick books that she she usually just bites on them .
and at story time of course at night we read them and she'll have her attention there for a couple seconds but she just not really interested in sitting and hearing the whole book yet .
do you have of of those ?
these specific books ?
we have one i i think it's this one it might be just really similar .
it's got the different things you can touch .
and then .
no that's it .
just similar to this one but not we don't have that .
i have doctor seuss books but not this one in particular .
and goodnight moon it sounds familiar but i don't think we have it at home .
i might have just seen it when i was here .
is there anything else you that noticed that was different than the last time or anything she did that surprised you today ?
she actually gave the stuffed animals although i only tried a few of them she gave them a little bit more attention this time than she did before .
she's kinda doing the same .
she didn't like the doll as much this time .
so i don't know why that is .
but last time she was trying to put shoes on it and everything .
and she didn't notice the books either maybe just because of where we have it where they are .
in relation to where i'm sitting .
other than that .
she liked the pizza because i think she likes the colors .
she was here last ?
about a month .
okay .
so do you notice any differences overall ?
on how she's playing or what she's interested in ?
she's a lot more interested in containers .
in and out .
she will actually help clean up now on her own .
which is really helpful .
i don't know if that says something about me or .
but she likes to do that .
she likes building toys .
much more into cause and effect .
kinds of things .
the the little shape the little popper with the animals .
where you push the different things .
she can't quite work that part yet .
but she knows that when we do it the little things pop up .
and she likes to put the faces back down so we'll pop them back up .
what else do you like aoife ?
she actually realy likes puzzles now .
and very much over the past month has gotten into she liked sitting and reading before .
but now she will go get books for us to read to her .
instead of us sitting down saying okay we are going to read a story .
she'll you know get books out of the little basket and come find us with it .
so you said she does have favorites ?
okay what kind of books are those ?
there's an abc book that she likes because her dad sings it to her .
thank you .
she has a couple books with baby faces that she likes .
the eric carle book from head to toe .
because we do the actions with it .
and she will do some of them to mimic us .
a couple of like the sandra boynton books that we've just been reading forever .
so she knows the pictures she knows the story .
she'll actually nod you know after you've finished a page like yes you've said it correctly and then turn it .
but she its actually a pretty wide variety of books that she likes .
she likes you know the ones with the real animals that you can touch .
pretty much everything .
but she does like the ones especially that we have downstairs .
where we have to you know sing or do an action or .
so interactive types of study ?
and she is unbelievably active .
all the time .
she .
i don't have much of a comparison but .
she does seem active .
i mean they all are at this age to some extent .
but she's very curious about the other things going on .
she wants to and she's she always has been interactive with other people .
she really likes other babies and really likes people .
you said she's more interested in you than she is in the toys .
by far .
yes .
mom said that right .
so then how about babydolls is she interested in faces like that ?
not particularly .
not so much .
she has started to like .
a hug ?
she has started to like her sorta stuffed animals more .
she will take a teddy bear and hug it .
she'll try to give it her bottle .
but more of the teddy bears than the babydolls .
the babydolls she's just kinda .
how about little you said a number of .
does she know any of those names for those kinds of animals ?
she knows duck .
she knows pig .
she knows cat .
she knows dog .
i would guess she knows frog .
cause she will actively seek out if there is a frog in a picture .
she will actively seek out and make sure she touches the frog .
i guess she knows bear .
so .
there's some very unusual ones in here and i wouldn't think that most kids would know some of them .
the donkey and the groundhog .
of course mommy picked the strange ones .
or they don't come up as much for you .
that's right .
you do know hippopotamus though .
well the the stories but not the hippopotamus .
so she's actually heard that word a number of times .
where you going ?
how about the food items ?
is she eating foods like any of these kinds of foods ?
she eats peas .
she loves peas .
she eats cheese .
she eats bread .
she eats waffles though she didn't go after that all .
she's never had an m&m cookie but she will have animal crackers .
pretty much all veggies .
she doesn't like spaghetti which i think is odd .
but she does love berries .
which you know the strawberries and the raspberries are bright red .
she sees something red i think and immediately thinks it might be a berry .
got your scarf ?
keep you warm .
it's a beautiful scarf we will put it on your neck .
let us see .
she did play with .
bring it over .
bring it over .
food items she did sorta was interested in those today .
okay .
and again although we asked for some for christmas she didn't get any .
so .
okay .
we've probably asked you in the past if she has .
i know you said she has stuffed animals and books .
does she have any of these types of things ?
nope we don't have any of these kinds of things .
although she a couple of babydolls although we have started .
thank you should mommy put that on ?
okay no didn't even look ?
thank you for bringing that over .
they're soft .
we have started having her eat off of * f instead of just kind of just putting it on trays plates and bowls .
so she's now more familiar with plates and .
she picked em up .
has she had any ice cream cones ?
no .
or any ice cream ?
she's had like a piece of like a popsicle but that doesn't look anything like the .
it doesn't look no .
okay .
she's had pizza crust .
and .
you found your book aoife good memory .
either that or it's by chance but regardless you found it .
okay i think i might have covered everything i needta ask you .
okay .
when she comes back for her two year old visit there will be a different set of toys which will be nice .
okay .
and .
what do you think he enjoyed the most today ?
the fake .
bottles .
the little juice cup and the little bottle .
is that usually something does he do you have that kind of food at home ?
we do .
we've got a little pretend kitchen set .
and he and his sister spend a lot of time playing at it .
and playing with the food .
so some of these things we have at home .
what which ones do you have ?
we have the icecream cone .
we have pasta that looks similar to that .
and the peas .
and have a one fake bottle .
but it's a fake milk bottle .
we don't have .
big wooden ones like this .
i think he liked the weight of them .
he liked playing with the peanut butter jar .
no he doesn't stack so much yet .
he likes to knock things down when i stack them .
or especially if his sister stacks them .
she likes stacking .
he likes knocking down .
they make a good pair .
today was actually the first time that i'd seen him take something gently from the top of the stack instead of just knocking the whole thing over .
normally he just likes to go kaboom .
with them .
but today he actually picked something up off the top .
well he i mean he probably recognizes peas because we .
both eat peas and have .
toy peas at home .
don't really eat peanut butter .
and the kids don't really have much juice .
but i think he probably just from the playing recognizes it .
because his sister does drink juice .
he does not .
so he may recognize that word as something that he's not normally allowed to have .
like no that's sabrina's juice .
he's also teething .
it could just be that he likes gnawing on them because it hits some of the back tee or you know some of the back gums .
baby .
what do you think he liked the least today ?
the stuffed animals .
every time .
he just doesn't care about them .
like i i don't know if he's played with them at all when he's been here .
and we have stuffed animals at home .
and he rarely .
unless they have like something jingly inside them .
he doesn't he just doesn't care about them .
he might .
maybe more regular ones like just dog and cat and stuff .
he might recognize some of those .
but he just doesn't really like playing with stuffed animals .
how about the books was that a big success today or ?
he's generally sort of luke warm about books .
he doesn't he'll listen i'll read to him when i'm nursing him .
and he'll listen .
and sometimes like when i'm burping i'll keep reading to him .
but we don't he doesn't really have the patience to sit and listen to the word books at this point in time .
he'd rather chew on them .
or .
if he can get his hands on paper books he likes to try and pull the paper because it makes paper .
he loves noise .
you do .
so his interest in the books here is about his interest in the books at home .
if i'm reading to his sister he likes to be on my lap too .
and we'll all read together .
that is not for you .
he loves wires .
loves wires .
if you had a pile of wires and electronics remotes you know cameras iphones anything like that that's what he would .
would play with .
which books do you did you read today ?
we did put me in the zoo .
and what was the other ?
we looked at the farm one .
he does have a touchy book on like vehicles .
trucks and stuff .
that he likes to like to read .
that will entertain him when he's in the car .
so i think you know he guess he likes the the feeling of them .
and put me in the zoo he just picked up and handed to me .
we don't have this one at home .
we've read it before .
but we don't have it at home .
go ahead .
i'm sorry .
i was just going to ask .
what so just to get the gist of it .
what do you think that everything that he liked today had in common ?
hard stuff that he could chew on .
hard or hardish .
he likes the textures .
and he likes things that .
make noise .
so we were it's actually it was an idea i got last time when we were here .
there was already the little cookie in here .
and he liked rattling it back and forth .
and so we spent some time putting .
you know things .
and once i put the first thing in he followed my direction and was putting more stuff in .
but he liked the rattling .
you know rattling this stuff .
and i guess the touch of the .
the books .
you keep grabbing the pizza .
is that the most typical thing that he .
we don't have this at home .
but at our play group there's a .
it looks exactly like this just bigger .
piece of pizza .
it's the thing that that they all fight over .
there's only one piece .
i'm sure that there were more at some point in time .
and kids probably walked off with the other pieces .
i don't know what is so fascinating about it .
but he was playing with the pizza .
and every time he picked up some .
thank you !
would you like it back ?
you cannot have the wire .
so no i don't know what's fas .
maybe it's the texture .
but he was playing with it a lot .
and it's a big favorite at play group too .
how about the baby doll ?
we have a couple baby dolls at home .
they are his sister's baby dolls .
he occasionally expresses interest in them .
mainly when she is trying to play with them .
he doesn't really look at them when he's on his own .
or when she's not around .
so i was trying to see if he would .
look at it and be like ".
look it's a baby doll !
you can play with it and feed it and stuff like that .
are you upside down ?
he likes being upside down .
he'll crawl and put his head on the ground and try and try and do a somersault .
likes being upside down .
into climbing on everything .
the daredevil .
very physical .
does he play with his sister with the the baby doll ?
it's generally trying to grab the baby doll and chew on her face .
or you know i think it's just it's it's plastic .
it's it's not real .
hard .
you know probably felt good against his gums .
and it gives the added benefit of teasing her because she's trying to play with it .
that's entertainment most days is them figuring out how to .
annoy the other one .
were there any differences on how he played here today and how he plays at home ?
not a lot .
at home we have more cars and trucks .
he likes he likes those a lot .
and things with wheels that he can move .
and we also have a lot of little people .
figures .
like the fisherprice little people .
and he likes playing with those .
but it's trucks and little people he likes a lot .
the f so you guys don't have them here .
but he doesn't have much interest in stuffed animals at home either .
and you've got a new friend .
careful stevie .
do not pull hair .
do not pull hair .
be gentle .
you've gotta be gentle .
you do not know your own strength .
good listening .
look at you .
that's sweet .
how about across the visits ?
do you remember ?
he' never really played with the stuffed animals .
he's always sort of looked at the books .
and has spent most of the time chewing on the food .
i mean it's it's pretty much been the same each of our visits here .
and once or twice making a break for the wires .
but it's it's been pretty common .
it it's always been the the food that he's played with .
the most .
but that makes sense for how he plays at home as well .
he likes likes playing with that stuff .
and one thing he didn't do today that he normally does at home is .
he's spent a lot of time lately taking two things and banging them against each other .
or banging them on the table .
like that seems to be his entertainment of choice recently .
is the banging .
trying to think .
what else do you do at home ?
it's strange because i don't honestly i don't see him play on his own all that often .
because he and his sister are always playing together so that kind of changes the dynamic of things .
because the two of them are interacting and either avoiding each other .
or one of them is trying to take the other's things .
either she's trying to take his stuff .
or he's trying to take her stuff .
and sometimes they trade back and forth and actually play w in the same space nicely .
which is awesome !
and really cool to see .
but it's it's just .
there isn't much time that he doesn't have somebody else around him .
either a play group or with his sister at home that's in the same general space playing with him .
so that's i guess a difference of being here versus being at home as well .
i was just thinking just having seen him react to you you know well definitely the no .
do you think he knows the name book ?
he might he might know book .
i'm not sure .
he does know no .
whether or not he chooses to mind me he knows no .
he no you know there's he's got a handful of words that he definitely definitely knows .
and the rest of them it's .
it's kind of amorphous as to .
is it that he's responding to my t like when i said ".
hand me the book .
and let me read it to you .
he handed it to me .
but is it because i said book ?
is it because i said hand it to me ?
is it because of my tone ?
or is it because my hand is out like this ?
and that's what he's holding .
because he likes to share .
he'll come over he'll crawl over to me and hand me something .
and i'll take it and be like ".
thank you !
and hand it back to him .
and that makes him happy because he's sharing .
i don't know if he knows the word book .
he might .
i guess it depends on what foods he's eating for him to have a level of excitement to eat it .
not really because i mean it's a l we're still having a lot of junky baby food .
i've been trying to we don't .
don't really get into the whole baby signing thing .
the two signs that i had learned were more and enough .
and so when i've been feeding him i've been trying to go ".
okay do you want more ?
you want more ?
at which point his two and a half year old sister pipes up ".
i want more !
i want more !
like you already have your words .
you don't needta do that .
but today for the first time i was feeding him .
and i was giving him some bits of hotdog for at lunchtime which was unusual for him .
and he kept going like this and going ".
and i tried giving him some cheerios which he also had .
and he kind of threw them of his plate and kept going ".
and so i was like ".
do you want this ?
and he started shoveling another piece of hotdog into his mouth .
so that was the first time that actually worked .
it never worked with his sister .
so now i think i might have to learn a few more to teach him .
besides more .
so i don't i don't think that he knows food names yet .
other than you know .
either he gets food or he doesn't .
we'll probably work on on water or milk .
to try and really see if .
the drinks are .
sometimes i can't tell if he's thirsty or not .
or he'll go and get in a big fight with his sister .
and i find out it was because he was after her water bottle .
and it's like yours was empty .
i didn't realize that .
other than screams and cries .
yes .
but the the bulk of his words are you know .
stop .
come here .
sister .
mommy .
daddy .
we know that he r like ".
where's your sister ?
like he'll look around for sabrina .
you know .
but i don't know i just remember with his sister that it was at some point she was crawling around .
and i was like ".
okay it's naptime .
let's go upstairs .
and i didn't gesture in any way .
she just crawled to the stairs and started going upstairs .
i don't remember how old she was at that point .
but it was just like ".
how long had this been building that i was able to say this sentence to her .
and she's nowhere near talking .
but she understood and followed it .
it's cool .
they're cool .
so compared to with like past visits because this is your third session right .
like what was different that like the toys she took interest in as opposed to other past ones .
she took a little bit more interest in the baby than in the past but .
she pretty much just likes the plastic food .
which items in particular was she pretty interested in ?
definitely the bottle and the sippycup .
does she have like items in her environment at home that are similar to that do you think that's why or .
she was drinking some juice in a bottle on the way here .
i noticed like kind of just a little bit from what i've heard like you tend to were like be like into different like actions or positions emphasize that is there any in particular like she likes to how like you play at home or .
she likes to be upside-down .
and she likes to be tickled .
they she's very active and so we .
we let her be active .
that's good .
she looks like she was having fun with it .
are any do anything of these toys like fit her her personality well at this stage or .
you like that bottle .
pretty much anything she can get her mouth on is all that she likes right now .
come on stand up !
no you want to be upside-down .
you singing ?
singing us a pretty song ?
does she have have any like plastic food at your ha home ?
or stuffed animals or anything ?
we've got a couple of stuffed animals but .
she's never shown any interest .
except to chew on them .
more a food person .
and she's got most of the toys that she has at home are hard plastic they're not food but they're hard plastic toys .
similar or anything .
what are did you notice any difference in how she interacted the food like .
i know some kids will like bang stuff together and i don't know stuff like that .
this was the first time she's re definitely recognized that as a bottle this time .
because she always put it the nipple in into her mouth .
she still banged it with the other things but .
she knew what it was .
okay .
she's funny .
hello .
pretty much .
is that silly ?
so there wasn't really any other food besides like the bottle or the sippycup that she paid much attention to ?
no .
not really .
she likes that .
that's gotta hurt .
that's gotta hurt baby .
i know there's carpet .
we've got progo at home so there's a lot of padding compared to that .
you like the keys ?
okay .
have you noticed her language are into like after doing these sessions like do you think she like remembers anything from them for the next time she comes back or .
i don't know .
she hasn't really .
well she might've remembered the clock .
she liked pulling things off of it last time .
you want to be upside-down again .
okay .
she's like a diver or something .
you sure are squirmy .
well i think that's it then .
okay .
you ready to go baby ?
thank you so much for coming .
no problem sorry i was late .
you going to let me and mommy talk ?
is it okay if i ask some questions ?
sure !
so what do you think she liked the most today ?
she's into food .
again .
she shouldn't be hungry .
she's had enough food !
was she into food last time too ?
she was into some of the food items .
a lot of the food items .
it was there was more .
last time it i mean she was into the pizza again .
the waffle .
the .
the cheese she didn't play with the cheese today really .
she was holding the peas can .
and .
not the peanut butter but it was i thought it was something else here but .
the definitely the peas can .
and she was into the biting the spaghetti .
i think i i at least heard .
and she was looking at the cookie and the hamburger .
but she was playing with that and i mean she plays with the bottle and the cup .
but it was like food .
is she familiar do you think with the words ?
pizza she sees she's familiar with .
i mean her brothers love pizza .
and so we make homemade pizza .
cheese she hears .
and we have cheese on the pizza for example .
hi !
hello .
her brothers like waffles .
so that's .
yes .
they like waffles don't they ?
waffles ?
waffles .
yes .
the boys .
you know .
yes .
yes ?
most mornings the boys are like can i have a waffle .
a lot of mornings it's no .
but .
yes .
hi .
hi .
hi .
he liked the peas but i think it was more the shape and the color .
he doesn't .
he doesn't eat things in that format .
and she likes the spoons and stuff .
she goes into the .
drawers .
hello .
hello .
sneaky .
i'm going to catch you .
you want to talk to the babydoll ?
baby ?
that's nice .
and i noticed you she's not going by you call her not alex but you have like another name or .
we have nicknames for her .
she goes by alex .
or ally .
or allyboo .
and so she .
hi .
or like her dad calls her girlyboo .
because her brothers are the boos .
so she's the girlyboo .
no coughing .
she's sometimes occasionally called by her middle name .
but .
what is her middle name ?
catherine .
that's nice .
and so .
she's getting used to a lot of names .
but she answers she knows it's her .
she goes comes running .
hi .
what about the books .
didn't she interested in anything today ?
i mean she looked at the .
the one that was .
where she .
maybe am i sitting on it ?
no the on the farm book .
she was interested in that .
and other than just opening and closing the books not really anything .
like when she was interested in .
she wasn't really interested in the animals today .
except for she did pick up the zebra .
no !
has she been in the past interested in the animals on the other visits ?
the first visit she was into the pooh and the eagle .
because they because i thought it was just red .
she really likes used to really be into red things .
and now it's more like .
food items .
she seems to be .
like she's picking up the dish and she's picking up the spaghetti .
she did that the last time was eating the spaghetti and was playing with that .
the cups and .
the different food items .
she wasn't interested in the baby the last time at all so this time she sort of looked at the baby .
do you have babies at home ?
no .
she's the baby .
okay .
there is a babydoll and but she doesn't and there's a lot of stuffed animals but .
she nor her brothers have ever really been interested i mean she has like a cow that she sort of walks around with occasionally .
no .
and tries to nibble on but it's not .
that none of them have really .
none of them were into .
stuffed animals .
particularly i mean .
the boys had pacifiers and that was their friend they never really got into them i mean .
and alex with play with some of them but .
not really much .
hi .
but now she's playing with them .
what do you think attracts her to the food ?
i i thought it was the brightness of the colors originally like last week last time .
sorry not last week .
last time .
anything red she went after so she went after the spam .
before .
and as the hat on the donkey or eagle or the thing .
and then .
last time she sorta was attracted to food .
and i thought well maybe it's food around the house but she was really into the spaghetti .
i thought okay it's the red thing again .
or the icecream she was into the last time but this time she's more into .
sort of food that she sort of sees or eat because she's had a little bit of spaghetti at home in the last few weeks for the first time .
brothers have the pizza .
we have cabinets with cans in it and she goes into the cabinets now and tries to grab the cans .
so i think it may be sort of things that she actually sort of recognizes cookie .
brothers like cookies .
that's interesting .
do you think when you're talking to her and kind of cheer like i don't know saying like propper or social things .
do you think she like catches on like .
sorry you're welcome things like that .
she's starting to like she will nod her head .
or she doesn't say yes or no or anything like that but .
she says hi she says bye .
she waves .
if you say come here she'll come .
if you'll say you know leave the cat alone then she'll leave sam alone .
okay .
she .
you know goofs off with her brothers when we tell her to stop she generally stops .
well that's nice .
that's very nice .
and did you say at home are you does she enjoy books at home ?
does she like what kind of toys is she playing with home ?
at home she's playing more with we have one of those fisher price tables .
okay .
we have two types .
one we have the old fashioned type that doesn't sing or do anything like a leapster and the other one's like the leapster type .
so she'll go and the one she plays with more .
hi .
it if you push buttons it'll make music there's like a little book and if you flip the book then it'll play one type of tune if you flip it the other way it'll play a different type of tune .
cool .
and so like one of the book pages you flip and it starts doing the song so she sits there and looks like she's trying to dance and trying to sing to it so you get these sounds that sound like out of her .
that's really cool .
so she'll do that .
you know she roughhouses with her brothers .
no .
excuse me missy .
you can't tear up the place .
she she explores a lot so this is typical like finding her finding the paperclip and stuff that's .
excuse me .
i mean we constantly have to keep things out of her mouth .
hi !
you know she has you know blocks and things like that in her .
pack and play but she more like cruises around the house and looks for things to grab onto .
and she has a like a soft book that she flips and will drag it around the house with her that's .
okay .
like a bath toy .
then like .
hi yes .
she has drawers that she can like pull out and play .
and so she takes the kitchen stuff out .
so she does that or .
there's a la we have a lazy susan in our kitchen .
and it has all the kids' dishes and plates and cups and .
so she'll go in and pull out all the cups and put them on the floor or like pull down all the plates and .
they're all over the house or something like that .
we have to pick them up and wash them and put them back .
be careful .
so funny .
so it's sort of .
there's i guess there's conventional play like she has like toys .
floating around but then she .
goes through and .
ponders .
no don't do that !
don't do that .
it's funny because one of my girlfriend's daughters got into that phase .
like sticking gagging herself and she thought it was so funny .
stop .
except for when it actually worked and then she was really upset you know ?
the child you know ?
she's like i didn't like that .
no no .
that's dirty you made the spoon dirty .
are you laughing about that ?
are you going to get it out and bring it back ?
you guys did a great job thank you .
what did you guys play with first ?
the i guess the food .
does he have pretend food at home ?
no .
no ?
okay .
what did he pick up that he recognizes or that he may have had before ?
well i mean i guess he's seen all of this stuff twice before .
but it's been a while .
i do not know he's always each time he's liked to play with the plastic stuff and the food .
and again it's in the middle so i don't know if that has anything to do with it .
but when i try to get him interested in the other toys he seems more interested in that .
the doll he had the same reaction he had last time .
which was to try and give it lots of baby kisses .
so .
which foods did he pick up ?
the pizza and i guess the bread .
and the hamburger and the salami .
and then he played a lot with the plates and the spoon .
which aren't food .
but food related .
okay .
what did you play with next ?
what next .
he spent pretty much the whole time playing with the food and the dishes .
he stopped to eat the baby doll's face periodically .
he wasn't very interested in reading books .
right now .
we did a couple pages .
do you play that game at home ?
he loves peek a boo he plays it in lots of different forms .
spontaneously .
i try to play with him with the puppets and stuffed animals a little bit but he was mainly interested in going back and doing this kind of thing .
which animals did you play with ?
the kangaroo puppet .
the deer .
i tried to show him the zebra and the chicken and the otter but he didn't really .
seem interested .
okay .
okay well thank you .
so which toys do you think she was the most interested in ?
the pizza .
not sure why .
you found it .
didn't you ?
was it the same as last time ?
i don't think so i think she liked the keys more last time .
which she still liked this time .
that's why you have this .
there .
and .
why do you think she was most interested in the pizza ?
i don't know .
i set it up when we first got in here .
i don't know if she saw that or .
just likes the texture of it .
okay what do you think she was least interested in here ?
stuffed animals .
did you look at any books while you were here ?
just one .
she was more interested in playing with the toys though .
is that typical for her ?
no .
she usually likes to at least look at the books .
but there's so much more stuff to look at .
that she's not used to at home .
do you have similar toys at home ?
we have food .
and books .
and stuffed animals .
nothing exactly the same .
what about the doll ?
does she have things like that ?
she loves dolls .
i'm sure her older sister has some too .
just a few .
do you think she would recognize the name of any of the objects we have here ?
books and bottles and maybe some of the food .
and obviously the doll .
okay and .
does she eat any of the foods that we have here ?
she'll eat pizza and bread and cheese and waffles .
cheese doesn't look exactly like ours .
alright is there anything else you think we should know about her play ?
are there things that are different that she does at home that we didn't see here ?
i don't think so .
i mean other than putting everything in her mouth .
normally she doesn't have her pacifier in her mouth .
so everything goes in .
that seems to be pretty typical for kids of this age .
yep .
yep .
hi .
thanks .
say hi .
so what would you say were her favorite was ?
the baby and the icecream cone which actually were her the same favorite toys from the last time we were here .
that's funny .
does she have these those toys at home or any others ?
we have play food .
we have wooden play food so it's just different .
and .
we have babydolls but they're in her sister's room so she doesn't usually play .
and she n it's funny the past three times we've been here she never goes near these toys and her two year old sister has like a whole collection of them and loves them and doesn't let her touch them and even like alone when i try to get her to play with them she's like no .
i'm like afraid to go there .
so .
which of these toys does her sister have ?
she has .
i mean she has a lot of toys just you know small ones like that but she has the sea other and .
she has a pink poodle it's not exactly the same .
she has a fox like this .
and then she just has she has like a different frog but like similar toys .
i think just in general she tries to steer clear of this .
which of these foods has she seen before ?
she's had everything .
she's she eats pretty much whatever we eat for dinner now so .
so anything that's there .
she's eaten .
does she like them a lot does she like these ones ?
she loves peas .
she likes icecream .
you love it .
i don't know if she'd recognize that we usually give her shredded cheese .
or cut up in really tiny that's only the thing other thing i would say is that usually when she does eat everything's cut up really small so .
okay .
like the spaghetti wouldn't look like a pile like that for example .
i know she looked at these books .
she we have a bunch of other caring cats books that she really likes .
and we do a lot of reading with her but we don't have any of these exact books except we have a lot that .
she's seen all of the animals in this book .
she actually does she didn't do it today but she does make several of the animal noises .
at home when we read her animals books like she'll do a cow and a sheep .
what else .
she'll do a duck .
so .
she just didn't want to do it today .
let's see what about these .
i know she does she play with yours ?
she does she loves mine .
mine or like my phone .
anything that's like not really a toy like she likes all these better than like the knockoff toy version .
so anytime she can get a hold of my keys she likes to play with those .
let's see .
does she she played with those two or is that .
i kinda pulled those out and tried to get her to see like would she do it because i was wondering that after the past couple times if she'd play with these kinda toys if her older sister wasn't around and she was kind of like wasn't feeling it .
either not interested or like conditioned to know not to touch those .
and it's not like i don't let her play with them at home but just the second she gets them her sister like rips them out of her hand .
right .
no matter what i try to do so .
right ?
what about this one does she eat a lot of these ?
not too many cookies but she does have them .
or how about this ?
she'll eat pizza too .
corn ?
she eats everything !
she does eat everything .
yes she does .
well she has ten teeth too she has molars so .
so she probably eats things that other kids her age might not be eating because she has the tooth capacity to do it .
right .
you going to give that baby another big kiss ?
let's see does she have like toy food and everything .
we have like a little play kitchen and then a lot like i said most of our toys are wooden or we have felt food too .
that she plays with .
where's that baby going ?
how about has she been on a farm or to a zoo and seen these ?
we gotta the zoo my parents have a farm .
with horses and chickens and .
bees .
pheasants bees .
pheasants .
so she gets you know she gets that and we were just at a petting zoo last week down in south carolina .
come on .
so .
and we just tend to do a lot of like animal books and when we do shows she watches a lot of animal shows and .
right sweetie ?
do you want to fill this out now ?
sure i can .
is that okay if she keeps playing okay .
sure .
okay .
here's a .
there's one there .
okay thanks .
alright .
so i'm ask you some questions .
okay .
so what do you think she liked the most today ?
the pizza .
the play food .
she definitely liked that .
and the icecream cone .
she kinda tried a little bit of everything .
she did .
e .
is it different from last time or the last two times ?
no i think it's pretty much similar .
from what i remember .
was the pizza her favorite last time or .
i don't know if she had a particular last time i can't remember .
and she always likes stuffed animals .
and she's been playing a lot more with her books at home .
so it's we kinda think it's funny because she just sits there and .
read but flips the pages .
so do you have any books like that at home ?
we have all these kinda .
that's why i put that up .
she was going to rip that one .
all the these .
board books kinda .
and anything doctor seuss .
we have a lot of books .
right erin ?
do you have one like that ?
she will go through her bin at home and pull that like there's toys and stuff but she'll pull that book out .
because of the .
she can feel everything .
juice ?
you didn't see that one ?
and everything must go in her mouth .
let me think .
does she eat any of those foods ?
she i mean she li she will have pizza but .
i haven't really ventured out much more than .
basic foods with her so .
does she do you think she recognizes it or no ?
no i think it was just the right size to go into her mouth and the right you know .
plastic chewing .
but the baby bottle she recognized because she right away and tha the juice cup right there which she's play with now but she knew that this was a you know a bottle .
do you have a babydoll at home ?
she has soft babydolls .
not one like this but she has little soft ones .
does she ever try to feed the baby or ?
because i know you were trying to do it .
no .
no she's never .
i i'm laughing because we have a lit she has a walker thing that's a stroller .
and we put the babydoll in there but li she prefers to walk the dish towel .
so she will grab the dish towel and put it over the .
so i don't think she knows or her she has like a little stuffed rabbit .
that's like a little blank and she'll walk that .
but that's what she sleeps with every night so that's her connection .
well that makes sense .
so it's either lovie or the dish towel .
that's funny have you started using utensils ?
shh i mean we feed her with a spoon but she doesn't use anything she uses just her hands .
so you don't think she would recognize the spoon ?
she probably would recognize the spoon .
but she wouldn't gravitate towards it .
no i don't know if she saw it to be honest with you .
i mean i think there's a lot here .
no !
see something .
i knew you were going .
so what kind of stuffed animals do you have at home ?
are they similar ?
we have we had a huge winnie the pooh that she .
well it's huge it's about the size of her that she likes .
like her little stuffed rabbit blanket she loves .
and any i mean any you know at christmas time i had a ton of little holiday bears and .
she'll find them and pull them down and she gives them like hugs .
she loves stuffed animals .
and we have those like learning ones those like leapfrog ones .
there's one that actually says her name and stuff so she has that she likes that one too .
you're silly .
what are those ?
yep .
everything in the mouth .
i noticed she was banging things around .
yes that's her she'll shh i mean we ha you know she got blocks for christmas and so it's just you know constant .
right ?
is that what you do ?
anything to make noise .
like that .
i also noticed that you were saying the colors of things ?
do you do that often are you trying to teach her or .
definitely trying to teach her so .
anything we can .
does she gravitate towards one particular .
i don't think so .
is her room in particular .
yes .
it's obnoxiously pink .
and lime green and all pastels .
that's cute .
so i'm trying to put a little more purple into her .
right so you're not too pink .
so do you play games like pattycake or like .
yes .
yes .
she loves peek a boo .
with that same dish towel .
she will go and grab it .
and .
she loves to pla and sometimes she'll just pl we'll catch her by herself playing .
so we go over and play with her so she she gets a that's her favorite .
that's cute .
that's the babydoll .
say hi baby .
hi baby you give the baby a hug ?
that's quite a hug .
and what kind of words of encouragement do you use like .
do you clap a lot or do you say like .
we clap and say go erin .
we clap or we do like a little dance for her .
and so she'll start doing her .
right erin !
that's good .
and she knows it .
that's .
that's good .
that baby's kinda heavy for you ?
it is a big baby .
it's really .
i don't know why we have such a big baby in here .
i know it's like the size of her !
hello baby !
sure .
okay .
so .
what do you think her favorite thing was to play with today ?
she's .
i tried to get her .
she's in this section .
this plastic .
fake food .
haha .
ha .
section .
and which food in particular ?
i do not know .
if it was a particular food .
she pretty much likes anything that makes noise .
does she .
generally is banging them together .
or .
this kind of stuff .
i would say .
i noticed that too .
haha .
haha .
baby .
what's she think about that ?
that's interesting last time she was really .
into that .
fascinated by it and this time she's kinda .
take it or leave it .
ha .
does she have any at home ?
not the hard plastic kind .
but the soft .
kinds .
and she'll lay her in bed and kind of hug it but .
she's got a twin brother that .
haha .
what a thing doll .
haha .
does she ?
do anything with the ?
the dolls at home ?
besides just hugging them like ?
she would with like a real child almost ?
do you know what i mean ?
not yet .
i think she's starting to get the potential to be interested in doing some of that .
she's starting to mimic .
a little bit .
but .
not .
yet .
what was her least favorite ?
toys or area ?
probably the stuffed animals .
cause she real really engage in books .
these .
are a little over her head .
kind of books .
but this kind of stuff she'll she'll really .
like she she made it through the whole book .
and .
these guys she just kinda .
right .
does she have a ?
yes .
and .
does she know any of those animals ?
like do you think the ?
not that i can tell .
i noticed that you .
made the .
the animal noises a lot .
do you do that a lot at home ?
do you think she ?
connects them ?
i would you know cow seems to be the one that i .
she seems to want to mimic .
the sound i'm making .
on cow but the rest of them .
she points at them and will even kind of outline them .
with her hand and kinda circle .
so she sees them .
i do not know .
that she knows specifics .
but .
do .
do you ?
do you mean the word cow ?
or the sound ?
picture .
the picture of it in in the book .
right but she chose to mimic .
i'm sorry .
no that's okay .
the word cow or what the sound ?
no the sound .
yes not the not the words .
i haven't seen her do that one time .
and so you said like the sounds .
do you think those sounds are easier maybe for him to say ?
probably .
one syllable .
haha .
then repeat .
what else .
your yourself .
now the food .
that you said she likes a lot .
does she have ?
toy food at home ?
no .
that's one thing we .
we used to have it .
for my son .
and then .
got rid of it after my son and then .
had a couple more .
haha so we hadn't we just haven't .
that's one thing we haven't replaced yet .
now .
do you feed her like ?
sandwiches at home yet ?
so do you think she would relate ?
no .
cause its just recent .
just recent .
so .
no .
but i do she does .
she is my little observer .
and she'll sit there and watch as i make anything .
so i do .
tell her about it so i do not know what she retains .
at all but .
and how about desserts does she ?
do you know that ?
not once haha .
has ever had anything think .
do you think she sees her older brother do you think ?
no ?
she doesn't really care .
from meat to cracker to .
cheerio to .
anything .
she'll eat whatever right now .
haha .
and .
is she .
usually utensils ?
she's just starting to get interested in .
trying with the spoon with the fork .
hand me a little .
plastic fork she's not .
you know great but .
she's showing interest in doing that .
to hold it and try .
and .
do you use a lot of words of encouragement ?
at home ?
yes .
cause i noticed you saying some here .
haha .
definite .
definitely .
can you give some examples ?
well i .
tell her when she's doing something right .
like if i say sela can you do this ?
and she does what i say i'm .
good job and then .
when she a little personal .
she's excited about something that she did .
you know .
acknowledge just anything really that .
is positive for her .
and want her to know .
that's great .
and what did she play with .
last time ?
what was her .
same ?
the same .
exact .
she really .
was into the books last time too but this doll seemed to dominate .
everything .
last time for some reason .
so no stuffed animals any of the last few times .
hunhunh .
not at home either .
she's just not it really .
other than her little doll in her bed but .
and we have them .
everywhere .
do you think she prefers the books over .
toys or at home .
toys over books ?
that's really hard to say .
cause she's really content in whatever .
is being done at the moment .
so she'll .
stay and do whatever she's doing for a while .
and then can move and stay .
so i i can't really say that i .
i see a preference .
i think probably the toys .
just cause it's more practical for her to by her on her own .
i have to be engaged in the books .
you know so .
i guess in that regard .
and do you have any of those ?
no i have the other ones .
you do !
yes .
well i have but .
she's more interested in .
chewing on the book and moving it around .
than actually engaging .
in it .
alright i think we're done .
alright good !
haha .
i think she's about done .
and her initials are ?
what was her last what's her last name ?
i just didn't have the sheet with me .
so i i didn't i couldn't i didn't know what her initials were .
her initials are .
i believe she's participant five two four four .
but i'm not positive .
perfect and now i'll just ask you .
i'm sure that you .
answered these same questions and some of them might be the same and some of them are probably different since he's so .
active now he might not have been the last time .
definitely not like .
which of the toys seemed to interest jack the most this time ?
and which is a good toy for ?
cause he he does like other kids and stuff so .
i mean he doesn't sit and play with it but like you know like pretend its but he just he likes to look at it that caught his attention .
and then all this stuff like .
he's not into stuffed animals even at home .
i think the objects things that look like stuff at home like the sippy cup he picked up and .
he knew what it what it was .
you know like to drink from it and .
i think they're just they're just easier to pick up really .
i think the the animals stuffed animals even at home he just doesn't really .
he likes hard objects i don't know if that's what that means but .
right .
and .
which of the toys seem to interest jack the least ?
the books .
an i * d think its because at home the books are only for sleep time .
we don't have th maybe we should have them out all day but we don't .
go to sleep so he thought he was going to go to sleep .
we needta get this cord out of here .
you just want to eat it up .
just had lunch why are .
isn't food .
like you're hungry .
food mommy has food .
here .
do you think that your child's interest has changed in any of the items since you were last here ?
no i think its it kind of all stayed the same i mean last time he wasn't really interested in the books .
and and the stuffed animals he just he went for all of things he could pick and hold and look at and feel and .
that's and the baby and the baby .
so no i don't i don't think they've it's really changed .
okay .
and .
if you hadta pick a po a book even if it was at bedtime which book do you think that jack would prefer to read or look at ?
the one that you could feel the little duck that on the farm the touch and feel i guess .
okay .
you know what we don't have like fake food or animals he's got .
just things that make noise toys and cars and .
boy's stuff .
boy's stuff i th you know what i noticed this was all very girl like i mean not that its just its even more geared to girls like food they play with f you know babies and stuffed animals .
there is no like ca like stuff that he can push and that rolls .
cause that's the kinda stuff that we have at home .
okay .
maybe that's why he can't sit still .
right .
so do you think he prefers books or toys ?
w .
which one ?
toys .
does jack play with any dolls at home ?
no we don't have any dolls .
no well we have a spiderman doll and yes .
he does play with that .
okay .
and you don't really play with pretend food or pretend do you feed the doll do you feed the spiderman ?
you know what no but i think i'm going to start trying to do that to see if he gets it you know .
and do you think that jack recognized any of the foods from last time you were here or from home ?
i think like the juice .
the sippy cup .
and .
i'd like to say he recognized the cheese cause it is ki you know .
it's the square kinda orange .
and maybe and maybe that's about it i don't know if .
that's probably the mo .
jack .
i think cheese .
cause he eats a lot of that .
drink .
i don't know if he knows baby .
i think he might cause .
okay .
that's about it .
well that's it .
okay .
hi having fun ?
yes .
yes .
okay so i just have a few questions for you .
so this time which of the toys did he seem the most interested in ?
as usual the food .
the food ?
yes .
any in particular ?
he really likes spoons of couse .
and he's learning to put you know what things fit in and out .
so he really likes smaller things that he can put in to s to bigger things .
okay .
but mainly if it makes noise it makes him happy .
okay .
what about last time ?
was it pretty much the same stuff .
the same .
first and second visit ?
okay .
you showing her the spoons ?
you giving her spoons ?
very nice of you to share !
thank you !
can you give them up ?
no ?
you're not ready to give them up yet ?
almost !
which of the toys does he seem the least interested in ?
the doll .
as usual .
even at home he doesn't play with any of the dolls .
okay .
do you ?
do you think he recognizes the words of any of these ?
not yet .
yes .
what about the animals ?
you don't think he's familiar ?
no ?
no .
he has the the little otter .
okay .
daddy has this doesn't he ?
the otter .
what about the other ones ?
i mean we have other variations of animals but .
nothing .
let's see .
we have some zoo stuff .
so we have the fox .
we have dogs .
and of course we have bears .
and zebra .
and the frog .
we have a frog don't we ?
we have a big frog don't we ?
what about books ?
is he interested at all ?
we love books .
but we usually read those before nap and bedtime .
and so he is just in the last couple of weeks gotten s more attached to the touch and feel books .
and then of course the ones if there's a hole in the front of the book .
he loves them .
so the hungry caterpillar's our favorite right now because they have holes in it .
okay .
do you do you own any of these books ?
we have .
see we have the foot book .
and we have the bigger version of put me in the zoo .
and we have the bigger one of good night moon .
okay .
do you ever play with pretend food at home ?
yes .
okay do you have any of these items ?
some of the stuff exactly the same like the icecream .
and plates .
but other things just similar .
we have bread pizza .
don't we ?
and of course you have dolly cups and bottles .
but we don't have anything like this do we ?
no we do not .
let's see what else do we have ?
i think that's pretty much all we have for you today .
yes !
think we can go ahead and ask you some questions .
okay .
okay .
did you notice anything different about what he liked today ?
compared to last time .
he liked the books even less .
okay .
i don't know if it's a novelty thing or if it's a .
he's at that age where he's discovering foods and he recognizes them .
that's i was curious about that are any of these things .
foods or items that he might recognize from home or from .
you know what ?
we don't really eat cookies and .
like this might look like yogurt he does yogurt .
but he .
but he definitely doesn't eat meat and we very rarely eat hamburgers like .
he just i think he recognizes it as food though like when i bring out new foods at home .
he automatically knows that it's food .
even when it's not offered to him .
and so he would know yogurt but he wouldn't know icecream .
he's never had that before .
unhunh .
and he may have he's seen us eat icecream before though .
and so none of these other things either .
or did you see some ?
he like he looked .
i didn't offer him anything i offered him like the peas and he was not that interested .
okay .
he's more interested in the hamburger like he grabbed it and tried to eat it versus you know like this which he looked at and then just set it down .
he didn't i don't know .
so i don't know if it's a texture thing it feels like food .
tried to drink the juice .
are you being shy ?
you being shy ?
so those are the main items that he looked at was the ones you already mentioned ?
this one's for mommy .
the cookie is the main one .
the main one okay .
each time it's been the cookie .
do you think is there any reason do you think he likes that one in particular ?
no idea .
it could be because of because it's something he can hold in his hand .
this .
you think it's the right size ?
i think it's partially that it's kind of colorful .
it's colorful .
did you do any in and out games ?
like some kids will put drop things into the pitcher .
into the pitcher no not yet .
is he making noise with something ?
i can't remember if he was .
with the book he started talking with the book .
i'm trying to think with the foods he's talking to the pitcher also .
he really likes the pitcher he played with the pitcher every time we've come in too .
something he was rattling .
the spoons .
the measuring spoons where are they ?
okay .
they're there .
okay .
he still has them .
he liked those .
so he likes things that he can do shake like that .
i see .
and then he did pay attention to some of the books right ?
yes .
right .
and first thing he did he kind of took inventory .
and then he stopped and looked at the books .
like he was thinking about it and then he's like no i'm going to go for the food .
and he kept stopping and looking at the books and he's like no there's not enough time .
i gotta get to the food what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
are you just lounging ?
silly .
are you being silly ?
so does he like books ?
yes .
because his brother does .
his favorite books are .
like anything we have with .
that are like really short but still have kind of .
some sort of plot like if it's just picture he's not as interested in it .
or anything even if it's nonsensical that has photography with babies .
like .
interesting .
very interested in other little kids .
very interested .
so did he pay any attention to ours ?
that's why i tried to get him to play with the baby and he was not interested .
he did look at her .
he looked at her .
the baby .
yep .
play peek a boo where are you ?
do you guys play .
peek a boo !
do you guys do that kind of game at home ?
yes .
so he's done that before .
but usually he always waits for me to initiate it i think maybe because it's a peek a boo book we just played we just read .
but normally i have to initiate it and quite often he waits for me to do the work .
those things i'm like i see this as a pattern with both of my male children is it a .
a boy thing .
wait for mom to initiate it .
and then you can do the work .
you do it .
at least in my experience .
we're losing our microphone cover .
and then i wanted to ask about the animals was he interested at all in the animals ?
i tried making noises with them and sta and he just he wouldn't even look at them .
no okay .
and then .
and he's he's been around a few animals and he's very scared of them so i think that might be part of why he's not interested in stuffed animals yet .
okay .
okay .
i was thinking the dog which actually looks enough like the dog that we have that he's had interactions with that i though he would recognize but .
no ?
nope .
so he might know the name though .
he might know dog and he knows .
pictures we've done pictures of and associating sounds with cows sheep ducks and horses and he seems to recognize those and anticipate those .
frog too ?
i don't think frog yet .
and probably not any of the more unusual animals that you have there .
hi are you just kinda sleepy you're going to put yourself to sleep ?
well let's see if there's anything i think that might be it .
haha ha .
hi !
haha .
okay .
so .
there .
there are going to be a lot of the same questions .
sure .
haha .
im used to it .
haha .
haha .
so what was his favorite ?
this genre .
any in particular ?
i wouldn't say in particular .
cause he kind of liked to play with .
whatever is in his hands .
and when he didn't like the .
pea on the plate thing .
but i'm not sure what .
how to .
classify that .
haha hah .
you sharing ?
ha ha .
that remind .
and you don't want to share ?
ha haha .
haha .
that was silly !
haha .
haha .
so .
does he eat that at home ?
version of that .
he's never seen actual spaghetti and noodles but .
like rigatoni noodles but .
easier to grab .
now you're going to do it ?
he definitely eats peas .
bread .
cheese .
okay and you said that .
some of the things his .
older brother might eat .
do you think he recognized them ?
no .
i just kind of .
try to incorporate brendon .
into it cause it's not enough .
that he seems him eat icecream .
haha .
and like for the first time yesterday and .
stuff like that so .
do you think it hasta do anything with the shape of them ?
i don't know .
if the shape or the color .
i'm not sure .
like the texture maybe ?
and yes .
i i definitely think the texture .
cause he'll he'll like touch it and then grab it .
so and .
haha .
and that is a pretty cool texture .
it is haha ha .
did you think some of ?
did you ?
do you think that ?
he thought some of the things were real ?
the bottle .
definitely saw that .
haha !
i know i felt it .
and the peas .
but .
other than that .
i don't think so .
maybe the cheese .
but .
and does he ?
use utensils too ?
no .
he's all his hands .
i can put it in his hand .
and he'll put it aside and use his hands .
he's not into that right now .
all barbarian boy right now .
so you .
haha .
haha that's what you're saying haha .
haha .
so you think he might not know what ?
no he knows .
he just i don't think he has the patience .
for it right now .
or the the desire .
to do it .
cause he'll see me .
and he'll maybe do one time .
and then .
doesn't want to do it anymore .
with a fork or ?
there hasn't been much need for a spoon so far .
what do you think he got out of those .
stuffed animals ?
he'd like to look at them .
and touch them .
but .
neither one of my kiddos really seem into that into stuffed animals .
i guess maybe get a little bit older and know what they are before .
they see a .
i do not know .
what about ?
the other items on the floor ?
well he was not interested in the books .
i know that was different haha .
haha .
that's a definite personality difference .
he does not sit .
he moves all the time .
so he's definitely all boy .
ha just like his older brother .
and what about the dog ?
he actually acted like it was real .
at first and kinda of .
and then touched it and think he realized it wasn't and then .
got over it .
but .
other than that that's his .
in here in this .
these sessions is are the only time he's ever .
come across it so .
if he gave much thought after he realized it wasn't a .
a threat to him .
haha .
so he doesn't .
play with his sisters ?
that's ours ?
no .
okay .
yep .
i know .
but no he you know what .
honestly his toys at home are .
balls .
and .
trucks .
and cars .
so he likes to do that kind of stuff .
roll the ball around and .
this .
those are action .
things so i think he likes those .
where are you going ?
and you used .
ow !
buddy that hurt .
you didn't use it as much with him .
but .
the .
noises that the animals make .
cause that didn't have the opportunity i guess .
really .
i didn't really want .
do you do it ?
know what to call this .
haha i mean it's a dog but haha .
do you do that with him at home though ?
sure .
he just wasn't interested today .
not today i guess .
with them .
and we have .
animals at home that are .
like this kinda material .
that he likes to play with .
and he really gets into that .
a little more than the stuffed animals .
i do not know if he doesn't have like a fantasy .
imagination yet .
to understand that they represent .
but he likes those little things a lot .
good and what about ?
noise .
like how does he like ?
toys with noise ?
yes !
the louder the better .
and he will laugh .
and .
just i mean always .
i mean call it keeping the beat cause he will just .
bang and hah it is so funny .
reese !
it's usually what he .
goes right for .
does he ?
play with yours ?
with my ?
the keys .
yes .
i don't really allow that so much these days cause the teething thing .
just everything goes in the mouth but he likes .
and he's got .
a whole set of keys that are .
much more involved than that one .
that they play with .
words of encouragement again ?
you used .
you used a few of them here with him .
you do the same thing where as ?
whenever ?
he does something good .
you praise .
they just really .
there seems just to help them develop .
you could almost see it .
you know that they become their the person .
they're supposed to be a when you .
let them know they are doing something .
the right way .
now do you usually say things or do you ?
clap ?
both .
it depends on if .
if its something that is the first time i've ever seen him do it .
then i clap .
cause that's like a .
a lot of times that's what i'll .
a you know just really good !
that's try that again .
that's really good !
and then i just .
encourage him if it's something he's done .
alright .
i think we've asked all the questions .
alright .
alright .
thank you so much .
it's a long .
hah a long study .
i really know how much you guys are doing its is .
haha .
twice as long .
haha .
as but .
most but .
i know you were just here recently .
but i wanted to just ask if there have been any chances that you noticed in her interests in terms of what she wanted to play with today .
compared to last time ?
seemed like at first she was just the bottle and the sippycup and the baby .
i don't know if that's because she's getting hungry .
and she associated the bottle with herself but .
she seemed more interested this time in the baby .
this is what really had her going last time .
texture has been a real big thing lately .
is that a sippycup ?
thank you .
different this time ?
didn't seem as much into animals this time .
no that's not for the baby .
that's for this baby .
see ?
anything that pretty much bangs .
she seems like she really just likes to make noise .
and she definitely imitates more .
i've noticed even the last couple of weeks .
okay .
anything that i do she tends to want to do it too .
like when i was doing this .
then she wanted to put something in it too .
so she definitely likes to imitate .
more than .
she has lately haha .
so that's a new thing .
okay .
but again the b this b we have a book very similar .
and she loves opening the flaps .
so i think a lot of things today she was picking up things she does at home .
okay .
such as the baby doll .
the bottle .
the sippycup .
this book .
so she does have a baby doll at home ?
she d i mean obviously not like it's a little bit smaller .
but she has a baby doll at home that she puts in her in the cradle .
she kind of tends rocking it and .
does she feed that baby doll also ?
she tries to with her with her bottle at home .
okay .
does she play with pretend food at home ?
not as much no .
so i don't know if it's just something different something new that she just .
i didn't notice did she play with any of the food items or kitchen items today much ?
i mean she was j i mean just kind of more the banging part of it .
more so than j really i like putting it in something .
okay .
she was putting them in here .
but was just kind of all different things today right megan ?
do you think she would recognize any of the food from the last time or from home ?
any of the food items ?
not as much .
i mean because we don't really have any actually any food items at home .
but we do i mean we don't have any of these same foods .
any of these .
fake food items .
no .
do you think she would recognize any of these comp you know as real food items ?
i know peas don't really come like this .
but they look a little like this .
she still really .
she has kind of food aversions .
she's really only eating mainly baby food .
so i don't know if she'd really recognize .
she would recognize these okay .
she's a little young for that .
maybe like the cookies just from holding trying to you know take bites of baby cookies but .
okay .
i think this she definitely recognized from last time haha .
unique .
she likes the hair texture .
which of the toys do you think or which toy is good for her her personality ?
no .
she's pretty active .
so i think anything that she likes to make you know do the noises and haha hold things .
she's pretty active pretty personable .
baby .
so i think doing things that make you know sound and effect or .
making people look at her haha .
like doing that .
which is maybe why the animals she doesn't really have as much of an interest .
i see they don't do .
it's pretty much of her like sleeping thing at home .
she sleeps with an animal but .
okay .
that's really the only time she really plays with stuffed animals .
do you think she prefers books or toys ?
during the day i'd say probably toys .
i mean she's at daycare all week .
it's mainly you know toys .
that they're kind of playing with .
although th this book she seems very fascinated by the flaps but .
we do read the books at night and so .
but i think during the day she mainly is with toys .
haha megan .
which of these toys do you think interests her the least ?
well other than this i'd say all the stuffed animals .
i think when i put them in front of her she didn't really seem to go for them .
let's see .
you like this one though ?
you like that hair tickle your tummy ?
which which of these books do you think she would most want to look at with you ?
okay .
just because she's .
involved in it .
and she can do something also .
okay i think that's it .
do you have anything else that you think we should know about that i didn't asked you ?
not that i can think offhand .
i'm surprised she actually sat here .
and now she's so mobile crawling around .
she did .
she does a lot of the crawling all over the place at home .
so i'm surprised she sat here for the .
so she was definitely interested .
i think maybe because it was something different .
i mean that's why she sat so much longer than at home .
it's the same old toys .
so i think she gets more bored easily .
she did sit the whole time .
she's usually crawling on everything .
all over the room so .
haha is that fun ?
you like that hair .
that is fun isn't it ?
that seems to be your favorite toy right now .
sure does .
okay well i think that's all i have to ask you .
okay .
you can go ahead you can leave that right there cause that way i don't have to write everything down the answers to your questions to the questions .
okay .
okay .
with her spoon .
so .
first question is have you noticed any differences in what she's interested in playing with or the way she's playing with toys since the last time she was here ?
i think the last the last two times she showed pretty equal interest in everything and this time she was pretty much ignored pile number three here .
i kind of think that teething has trumped everything else she went straight for things that looked hard and yummy to chew on .
and she she caught a top tooth yesterday and so i just think .
you got some spit on you .
i kinda think that that trumped everything else in in the play session today .
but she also showed interest in in the frogs so you know it's .
it wasn't to the exclusion of other things .
okay .
did she was she interested in any of the other animals .
that you got out for her ?
the chicken the frog and the chicken were the two that she showed the most interest in .
i you know pointed out some other things but she didn't really .
going for it * she definitely liked this frog .
cool .
you too !
and how what about the hard toys that you said she did like the best ?
did she have certain ones that were favorites .
today ?
the cookies .
the two cookies she really liked .
this purple spoon the smaller of the two spoons she liked .
she spent a little bit of time with the sandwich parts but mostly the cookies and the spoon .
and do you think she would recognize the names of any of these especially like the food items .
i don't know because it looks different .
i make i make them sandwiches with cheese and turkey but i cut them up really small so it doesn't look like that and i so i'm not .
i'm not sure that she did that .
she doesn't they're not drinking juices yet so apple juice is foreign to her .
okay .
so probably not .
right .
not at least by the way they look .
right .
okay .
cheese she's definitely heard those things bread .
let us see what else .
and .
she did she look at books today ?
not really i tried to get her interested in this good night moon one but she didn't really seem like she was interested in it .
okay .
let us see .
and .
does how about toys at home does she have stuffed animals does she have a baby doll ?
she doesn't have a we don't have baby dolls .
she does have stuffed lots of stuffed animals and she does have plastic food and .
she does okay .
recent that's recent she got a shopping cart from grandma for christmas and including plastic food .
so .
so that's a new thing .
we have tons of books at home so she's familiar with some of these things .
okay .
does she have any books like the ones that we have here ?
very similar .
okay .
we've got doctor seuss we've got the original good night moon not this particular one .
okay .
are you making a mess baby ?
so the main difference in the way played was the teething thing and so she you feel like she was chewing more ?
i think i mean .
she all she always chews when she comes here but .
but i think that her exclusive interest in pretty much in the food was because of that .
because of that .
alright .
i think that's everything i needta ask you .
and i'm probably going to ask you very similar things for allison .
of course .
yup !
because that's the way it works with twins .
and i'll go ahead and take it out and turn it off .
so i just have a few questions for you .
so do you think there have been any changes since the last visit or things she plays with ?
yes she plays with this .
this kitchen .
equipment .
these kwitch kitchen toys where before she ignored them .
any in particular ?
any toys in the kitchen ?
she likes the measuring spoons .
she liked the fake bottle .
i think the spoons and the bottle .
so what toys out of .
any of the other categories does she like the best ?
she likes this bumble bee .
and .
what do you think attracted her to it ?
the colors .
definitely .
and this .
spongy texture .
for the hair .
right ?
yes .
does she have any of these toys .
at home ?
no not these exact toys no .
obviously she has bottles .
and .
the sippy cups but no not the exact toys .
so do you think she was attracted to the bottle because shh .
it might looks like a real one ?
because she tried to suck it .
so .
right ?
which toys do you think she likes the least ?
the doll .
do you have any at home ?
no .
no baby dolls at home .
no we don't want the microphone .
well we do want the microphone but we can't play with the microphone !
are there any of the books ?
do you have any of those at home or .
not the exact books .
we have a good night moon but not that .
version .
so what did you say she played with last time ?
last time she played with the bumble bee a lot .
and these stuffed animals if i remember correctly .
are there anything in the .
that you thought she might've recognized .
in names of .
or even things at home that .
you've noticed that she'd recognize ?
of toys ?
not really .
i mean she recognizes bottle i think .
but the names of toy .
she probably recognizes .
dog .
although i don't think i said the word dog .
but she probably would recognize dog .
cause we have a dog .
but other than that no i don't think she would recognize .
she may recognize the word spoon .
come over here .
elenor !
where you going ?
and do you use ?
does she use things to eat ?
she tries to .
it's not very successful .
but she does try .
right here .
has she started eating any of the foods here ?
like cookies or ?
yes .
but not in the .
it wouldn't look like this .
it's all .
she has waffles but they're all broken up .
so i don't know that she would even recognize .
what what it looked like .
and cookies of course .
right ?
but you .
use the names in the house ?
we do .
and everything ?
what are you doing ?
i mean she would recognize .
if i took the eggo box out she would recognize what it is .
definitely .
right ?
she wants to play with you !
she wants to play on me .
right ?
do you guys ?
when .
i may have missed this question .
when you play at home ?
do you play ?
what do you play most with ?
what does she like at home ?
at home ?
right now she likes her wheely cart .
where she can stand and push it .
and that's probably her favorite .
thing right now .
but we also have sort of sta .
stackable cups .
that break apart and go back together .
and she likes those .
those are probably her favorite things right now .
okay .
alright ?
why do you think she likes those .
stackable cups .
the cups ?
they're rightly rainbow colored .
i know !
and they come apart so she can bang them together .
and she .
she likes to throw them and they roll .
nice .
so it's multifunctional .
i think .
right ?
she's agreeing .
she has agreed .
well great !
i think we've .
picked apart the discussion .
okay !
well enough .
with what happened and everything .
guess i can ask you some questions now .
okay .
since you've been playing for a while .
i wasn't really looking at him too much .
so i'm not sure what he liked best .
out of these .
but these look more spread out than these so that's what i'm guessing .
i think definitely he went for the clock again and the food .
stuff .
and the food .
excuse me .
yes .
specifically these peas .
i don't know why .
especially those ?
did he like anything else foodwise ?
he liked this .
was it th this one or the red one ?
was more .
this one .
and then i don't know if it was color choice or not but .
and then he liked this cookie once i showed it to him .
but he hasn't really had cookies yet i mean i just think maybe the multiple colors .
the colors .
the measuring spoons he liked the way that jingled .
didn't i tried to get him interested in the stuffed animals to see .
and he didn't show any .
interest really .
i thought you were doing the rooster i thought he would like that .
but he didn't show too .
he didn't seem to .
not really .
didn't spark anything with him this time .
looks like he's found it again .
he really likes that .
and i i mean i haven't looked for anything similar to that but .
i remember last time he liked that right .
he did .
and then when we asked him you know when i said ".
where's the clock ?
he went toward it .
but this time he didn't seem to really register the way it did the first time .
was that the main thing that he liked last time ?
i'm trying to remember .
yes yes .
he just stayed with that for the longest time .
okay .
and now he's found .
look it he's trying a lot of things ?
and he likes to just pick things up and throw them to see how they .
sound when they land like that .
you know these things are heavier .
and i could see that he was like ".
right .
that made a different thud instead of the .
the peas that were so light .
so do you think he likes them for that reason ?
so ju different things they're different weights and they sound different ?
i think that's what he likes to experiment with is .
just seeing how they .
what gravity does ?
like what happens when i do this right ?
haha .
did he try any of the books today ?
he didn't .
i got the out .
and he didn't seem to even .
recognize what i was trying to read .
okay okay .
i know you tried with .
i tried the kangaroo .
kangaroo .
that's it .
and the chicken or rooster .
no interest there .
okay .
no .
he didn't like pitcher until i put something in there .
it made a sound .
made a sound ?
that was .
so he didn't .
that was that that he liked .
and but he you know when he got it out then he didn't want the pitcher anymore .
he didn't want to try to put it back in like .
sometimes he might .
balance out ?
it does .
you found the clock again i know .
let's see .
if or at home maybe if you're reading a book with him .
would he rather turn the pages himself or does he like you to to sort of do that ?
he wants to hold the book .
he wants to hold it okay .
right .
what i found yesterday was that the best thing was for him to be in his highchair haha .
to try to read because otherwise he's grabbing it .
and depending on you know these pages books are fine but the thinner ones he would just be tearing at this point so .
but he wants to be .
he wants to be in control of that .
exactly .
and would you say he likes toys better at this point than books .
definitely .
okay .
does he play with any dolls at home ?
he hasn't .
and my daughter has a lot .
but he hasn't he's gone toward her favorite doll a few times but i think it's only because she .
plays with it so much .
i don't really think .
it's not so so much that it's a doll .
right i mean all the out of all these dolls he didn't go for that .
he wanted to play with this doll's eyes a little bit .
and touch the mouth and the nose .
but i don't think he was really .
i don't i don't think dolls are his interest area now .
okay .
so would you say that i know it's not the food toys but the animals or the books interested him the least this visit ?
which one was sort of least interesting ?
i would say the books would be the least interesting this time .
okay .
i mean it seemed like i sparked a little bit of interest with the .
puppet and the r chicken but not .
and the books i mean i may as well have not been saying anything .
didn't seem to do anything with those .
and .
which kinds of toys do you think are good for his personality ?
the stuff that has an effect like when he's shaking the .
the teaspoons or the measuring spoons .
he can hear a reaction .
so at home there's a little play piano .
so he likes to po i mean he's not playing it .
but he likes to pound on it because he knows that it makes a sound .
i don't know .
does he have any of those toys that you push a button and something pops up .
yes .
he like he likes those .
he likes things there's a .
so cause and effect ?
cause and effect kinda thing .
where he's you press a button and plays music .
or i can't rememb it's something that you can hang on the side of a crib .
but we don't use it for that .
but there's a little dial that you can turn .
and like these two gears .
turn .
so he likes to see that happen .
push and pull kinda stuff .
anything that he can hit to make a sound or .
okay .
fair enough ?
and the kitchen my our play kitchen's in the basement .
but he would be all over this stuff too if he could just .
whatever he can shake and .
whatever's making noise .
move or press buttons .
right .
pounds things together all the time .
because he was trying to do that with something there .
and it didn't make much of a noise .
i think it was the two peas .
it was like the peas and something .
and it didn't really didn't really do anything for him because it didn't make a noise .
right .
right so you s you skipped that and went on to something else ?
do you think he recognizes the names or any of the like food items or the utensils or any of the animal names yet ?
no .
no you know i filled out that form and i said you know i don't know if he's supposed to know any of this stuff but he doesn't .
i mean we .
no no there's no they're so variable at this age their interests what .
there's nothing that he's supposed to be doing that we have here .
it's just sort of looking at what he wants .
of interest .
i i can't say that like last time we we che we said like ".
lucas find the clock !
okay .
because he seemed to know the name of it then .
but .
and i think .
there are random things .
like i think he knows milk now but not any of the .
i i don't think i could say to him you know ".
get the book .
or get the .
if you i think the reason we may be asking that is just that if he did know some of the names and you said the name would he be more likely to go get that than if he didn't recognize any of those names and was just playing so you know .
no no sweetie .
that's it it's just interesting to look at patterns that way .
right .
right .
he likes chords .
so have you noticed any changes in the toys that she's been playing with here ?
since last week ?
no not not really .
probably since last week i have tr tried to be more purposeful at home .
because its it like made me aware that i that she's she's not doing too much like pretend play yet .
but .
but shh you know she just kinda explores stuff .
rather than doing too much meaningful .
play situations .
can i have those ?
two thank you .
she has been giving me stuff more lately .
and she's definitely she definitely gets angrier when she's not allowed to do what she wants .
whether it be with a toy or not .
lately .
so out of the toys that we have here which ones do you think she was most interested in ?
the clock .
i could see that .
what about the food items ?
do you think she liked those ?
i think i think she likes plastic .
toys a lot .
you know one's that she can put in her mouth .
i see her eating a lot .
one's that make noise .
right ?
yummy .
and definitel she's definitely not really too into stuffed animals or or dolls at home really either .
you know brief brief interactions at best .
okay i noticed that you were trying to read a book .
is that something you do at home ?
but i i really only have success if it's like before she falls asleep and we're in like a rocking chair and i'm not like there's no other toys around .
she's she's not really into them when there's other options going on .
gentle gentle .
that's mommy's .
do you think do you have any similar books at home ?
we don't have any of these specific books .
but we do have like we have some of this series and we have a couple board books .
we have the b the books she likes the best when she does like books are the ones that have the sensory piece to them .
and like we have her books but not this specific book .
and and i pretty much only do like lift the flap or the touch and feel books with her .
those are the ones she has the most attention for .
do you think there are any items here that she would recognize the names of ?
maybe cup .
i kinda thought she would she would recognize the bottle .
so i thought she might she might know bottle .
and spoon .
but pretty much the .
and and cookie .
spoon .
cookie .
bottle .
are the ones that i would think she had the most she would r re identify most easily but i'm not sure she would .
well shh we were here last week .
and i think they were all the same .
i think .
definitely .
we don't have .
like .
we don't have that whole sandwich kit .
our our pizza is different .
icecream she's never she doesn't see in real life .
or war toys .
so .
this stuff here is different .
do you have pretend food at home ?
and she likes it .
she likes best to like take it .
we have a little kitchen .
she likes best to see what's in the pot and dump it all out .
you know she's still like .
into .
dumping .
okay is there anything else you'd like to tell us about her playing ?
at here or at home ?
nothing really too new .
shh she really wants .
someone to play with her a lot of the times now .
and that's pretty new in the past few months .
and if her sister is playing somewhere in the same room .
she'll go there .
no matter what she's playing with that's where she wants to be .
so i think she's i think she's looking for you know interaction .
more .
no .
she has been mouthing less since she started walking about a month ago .
but with new things .
and with things she knows that are typically .
mouthed .
she puts it right in her mouth .
you're so funny .
is that good ?
alright well then i think we're all done here .
okay .
ready to go .
don't with .
what we need from you guys .
that was just .
okay .
fifteen minutes .
so i can just ask you a few questions .
sure .
i know you want to .
get her changed .
haha ha .
ha .
i think at one point she was .
a little distracted cause she was .
focusing on .
ha hah .
well what did you was .
her favorite .
items or types types of items today .
i would have to say the cookies .
haha .
ha since she .
has been holding them the entire time .
and or trying to eat them .
and do you think she recognizes .
that as a food that she's seen before .
no .
i i don't think she recognizes any of the foods yet because .
she's eating .
foods .
like this .
but we usually just give her .
you know we'll give her five or six small pieces at once .
so she doesn't necessarily see the full .
the full .
you know she'll have pizza but it'll be .
a few pieces of you know a few little .
bites of .
pizza not the full slice .
so .
and so .
do you think she just likes ?
i i'm not sure if it was the colors or .
they don't .
i don't think they look like toys she has .
so i don't know what it is about the cookies .
that she likes in particular .
but .
i see that she's wanted to hang onto them .
haha .
so did you think that she liked anything else ?
besides the cookies today ?
i was sorta surprised she she loves .
books with flaps .
and she didn't seem very interested .
so i think the cookies kind of .
for some reason .
were such a focus .
but usually she loves books like this .
so she does have books at home ?
the peekaboo books are her favorite .
and she has .
not this one but .
where's baby's i do not know it's by the same author .
but .
she likes .
she likes those so .
we've got some .
we've got a book over there .
that has some textures does she have any like that or .
one .
her peekaboo books all have textures in it and she .
she sleeps with a couple of them .
and when .
you know she wakes up in the morning .
she'll play with them .
and i'll come in and all the pages are open .
and she's been you know .
she knows right where to go on the page .
to touch the texture and .
so .
does she have any baby dolls ?
of any kind .
no .
okay .
does she have stuffed animals ?
she .
has a few that are favorites .
she's got a dog .
that she sleeps with every night .
and there's a couple of rabbits .
that are sort of her cuddly .
animals .
i noticed you were .
showing her some of them .
i don't remember which ones but .
do you ?
have ?
do you guys ?
do you go through animal things with her ?
names of animals or sounds or things like that ?
i try to stick with the ones that make noises i know haha .
ha ones that i went i don't know what noise this makes .
but i could tell you what it's called .
but it's not going to be as interesting haha ha .
right .
haha .
we have some odd ones in here don't we .
haha ha .
like i know this is a deer .
but what did but what sound do deer make ?
right .
i'm not really sure .
so .
haha .
right .
exactly .
pick it up ?
you dropped a cookie !
here's your cookie .
here's the cookie .
here it is .
haha .
there it is .
ha good job .
okay .
and she did just learn .
earlier this week so big .
which is why she .
sometimes just does it .
cause she wants to hear .
so big and .
get that response .
so big !
one day .
she just went around the living room .
she just kept going like this .
so then you'd have to keep .
right .
haha .
ha .
she looks like she likes this chair .
she doesn't have any .
kid chairs at home .
she used to at daycare and she loved it .
i just haven't gotten one for her yet .
now you're talking .
now you're talking .
haha .
let's see .
so .
do you think she .
you said she probably wouldn't recognize any of the food items ?
as food items ?
would she recognize any of the names of food items ?
no .
the only thing she knows .
she knows the concept of being hungry and .
she asks for more but i think that she thinks it just means food .
and she .
asks for milk .
with sign language those are the only two she's doing right now .
but .
you know and yesterday i wasn't sure if she just .
thought she always hadta show more when she was eating .
but yesterday we were she was eating .
and .
just i was giving her fruit .
and .
i was eating some .
and she was eating some and i had a bunch cut up ready to give her .
and i one point i said do you want more ?
and she kinda looked at me and turned around and started playing .
so .
she wasn't just doing it in a response to me always saying it .
i think she's started to figure out .
if i don't want more i don't say it and i haha .
you know .
i don't get it .
so .
okay .
you feel like you're starting to get to pair the meanings with ?
and .
out of these things here ?
what do you think she liked the least .
this visit ?
everything but the cookies .
haha .
haha okay fair enough .
and do you ?
feel like ?
the way she's played ?
or the things that she's played with today are different than the last time you here ?
she usually goes for the food .
i think because just .
plastic and she likes to put plastic toys in her mouth .
now you have the peas .
you had peas for lunch amelia .
you liked them .
they were yummy .
right ?
so i think usually she goes for the food .
and i'll try .
i always try .
bring in books and read to her .
sometimes she's playing .
and i'm reading a book .
and she's not really paying any attention but .
but i figure .
you know even if she just hears it .
right .
so .
right there's no harm .
done .
and does she have any ?
favorite toys at home that aren't here ?
she has a set of stacking cups that she really likes .
and .
sorting .
like a sorting thing .
the .
she usually loves the peekaboo books .
and she'll .
there's a couple other books she likes too .
i think one's like baby's first words .
and it's kinda got a soft cover .
and i don't know if it's the cover that she likes or .
the images are all .
they're actual photographs .
instead of .
you know .
drawn things and she .
and actually now that i think about it the peekaboo books are photographs too .
so i do not know if she prefers photograph books to other things .
that's interesting .
but .
what else do you like to play with at home ?
a few moms have said .
you don't have it here but my child loves balls for instance .
she's .
i mean .
we don't have a lot of balls really the only balls we have around the house are .
the tennis balls for the dogs .
okay .
and she doesn't really seem to have much interest in them .
does she like .
the dogs ?
sometimes she'll ignore them sometimes she plays with them .
or she tries to .
she loves to feed them treats .
okay .
she love she thinks that's really funny .
and she .
sometimes likes their bones haha .
but a lot of times they see her coming and they're like .
i'm out of here .
haha ha .
ha that's that's that kid again !
they're .
they're smart .
haha .
i remember that stage .
kids were that her age .
okay .
so let's see .
that might be .
does she have any dishes and ?
and play food at home ?
no .
not yet .
no .
okay .
i think .
alright so .
i think we've asked you this before but .
in case we haven't .
what toys do you think are the best ones for her ?
personality ?
or why do you think certain toys interest her ?
she likes the feel of the plastic .
to chew on .
and .
maybe .
also because they are a little bit smaller .
these are a little bit bigger right .
you know for her .
hands and so these are easier to .
to pick up .
does she like toys that make noise ?
not so much ?
nah i mean .
we we don't really have any toys that require batteries .
so she when she sees them .
the banging .
we have some .
musical toys .
because we have a tambourine and some other things and .
sometimes she'll play with them .
but i think i like them more than she does haha ha .
and i bought her one of the little .
pianos that that you know just has the four notes .
and you press the buttons and every time .
amelia come look !
and i'll play it and she'll look at it .
and then she'll just turn it over .
haha like okay .
this was a bust haha .
at least for now .
i'm sure as she gets older .
right for it would be more interesting .
but .
okay so it's not so compeling .
no .
hah .
i think that's all .
but she has a maraca she loves .
we didn't tell about that .
a maraca .
right .
it's got a nice handle and you just shake it !
you shake your maraca right ?
makes a nice noise .
okay .
well is there anything else that we should know that i didn't ask you ?
i don't think so .
what do you think amelia ?
well thank you though .
so we're going to see you when you're two .
another year !
so is it okay for people to ?
for other labs or our lab to call you if there's studies in the meantime that she's the right age for ?
okay .
so we'll leave you as .
it's okay to contact .
and we'll call you .
well ahead of her .
next .
okay .
visit to set something up .
here you go kiddo .
careful !
you mind if i start asking you some questions ?
sure !
okay what do you think she liked to play with the most ?
i think she loves noise makers .
okay .
and she seems to be really into the spoon which looks a lot like the kinda spoon she would eat from so that doesn't really surprise me .
and she just likes to make little noises .
and pick things up and see if they make soft sounds or loud sounds .
she'll experiment with that stuff at home so .
that's not surprising is it ?
is it similar to what she played with last time ?
it i can't remember exactly what she played with last time .
i know last time she liked the measuring spoons .
but she always seems to gravitate toward the kinda food lou louder harder kinda toys and stuff .
this was funny to me because since we've been here last she drinks more out of a sippy cup .
so you know this i know this is a sippy cup but i wouldn't necessarily think there'd be enough things that would make her think i should do this and put this in my mouth .
and we don't drink anything bright orange for instance we don't have a little tiny thing .
hers all have little handles and the spouts different .
but it was interesting to me that she understood that's a mini sippy cup and i'm going to put it in my mouth and see if anything comes out .
so that's kinda funny to me .
was there something that you tried to play with with her that she was absolutely not interested in ?
the books .
you know she seemed like she had enough going on that she didn't really care about the books .
and like this stuff was interesting but only in so much as can i make it make a noise when i hit it with a spoon .
and if i can't okay then i'm moving back to my loud toys .
so i think that she was kind of again gravitating toward the the food plastic kind of clanky sounding stuff .
what were some of the animal names that are familiar to her ?
dog .
certainly dog maybe not poodle .
but dog .
we do talk about a goose but not that much .
the ones she's really familiar with actually aren't really here .
like we talk more about kind of the farm animal stuff .
like the animals that would be in here she hears about a lot .
frog .
she hears frog .
what were the animals in that book that ?
definitely like duck lamb or sheep horse cow a lot of and pig .
i mean pretty much all these sort of farm animals are ones that she hears a lot .
she has like a little play farm and then she has books that have the farm animals and we have a puzzle that's a farm puzzle .
so it seems like we just have a lot of stuff that lends itself to being talked about .
so she hears the sounds and we make the sounds and she plays with the different things .
what is that ?
and at home does she does she prefer toys over books as well ?
it's funny it'll just kinda depend .
she she definitely likes being read to .
and she's and we build that into her day .
but i think she would prefer to be on the move right now .
so reading is kinda like we're reading to her and she's playing .
and then reading is like before a nap or before bed .
you know she's more willing to sit on our laps and and read for a while .
and then sometimes you know she'll be cuddled up and kinda quieter and we can read for a long time .
so it it totally depends but she will mostly if she's in play mode books are not going to do it for her .
she's going to want to be like .
moving .
does she like certain books over other books ?
yes .
definitely .
if it's a book that like she normally will like things like this that have flaps and she'll do the flaps after i do them .
she definitely prefers like some of the books we have at home she'll you know kind of while we're reading it she'll do this and then she'll turn the page herself .
she's not into long stories .
i mean what you would kind of expect .
faces real faces real pictures seem to be something she's more into .
and then we have these helen oxberry books this like set of four books that are just really sweet really simple and they are all you know illustrated they're not pictures .
but it's just real simple messages and they're big baby faces that are doing things like clapping or tickling or there's a good night book .
and she likes that .
she'll sit and look for a long time which .
when we first got these books like they have a total of like eight words in the whole book .
and i'm like how is this a book ?
how is my kid going to like this ?
i don't like this .
and it's actually it's some of our favorite stuff to do .
because it really just kind of cuts it down to the simple you know like up down up in the sky .
you know swing low swing high .
bumpity bumpity hold on tight .
hush little baby say good night .
and that's the whole book .
but it's like she loves it and so we love it .
she is just looking at you .
i know like i know that .
she likes her goodnight moon .
we read that .
so just nothing that's like long or like we really haven't gotten into doctor seuss she doesn't seem to like as much yet .
that's too a little bit longer ?
okay .
longer story and maybe just not as interesting for her to connect with or something i do not know .
what are some of the foods that might be familiar to her ?
in that you played with or ?
well definitely cheese .
we you know will have a snack of a of like pieces of of a slice of cheese .
the peas .
certainly .
bread you know .
little pieces of bread .
or waffle .
probably not so much icecream we don't really eat that at home .
she doesn't really see that .
pizza maybe .
and i have no idea what some of these things are so .
i wouldn't be really familiar .
but we don't do a lot of desserts .
so nothing desserty .
but certainly in the last couple months she's gotten a lot more into you know we eat a lot more solid foods and baby foods now .
how about juices ?
no juice but we do water in the sippy cup and milk .
so she would be familiar with probably those kind of drinks .
but nothing like that looks co like it has color to it .
that would probably just look like .
something funny .
i'm sure you'd figure out to try to drink it because it was liquid .
how about babydolls ?
does she have dolls at home or how did she fare with this babydoll here ?
she that baby doll doesn't really look anything like what she has she has kinda soft babies .
a couple of them are supposed to look human .
one is like a funny yarn flower kind of doll .
we have more stuffed animals now in the crib because we found that she's more into them .
and she has like a big bunny that's really funny that has different sensory kind of noises it makes and things it can do and she will kiss that and hug that and like talk to that and the same thing with this little like one hundred and one dalmatian doll that's at our house .
that she really gets into .
but not so much anything that looks like a real baby i don't think she .
gets that as much yet .
it's just like a soft cuddly little thing at this point .
are you doing like body parts and ?
yes we we've done that we've got some books that have that we have some rhymes we do and then we do we're doing more like the songs .
like han you know head shoulders knees and toes .
we're doing that more .
we have these little rhymes that we do with her .
so we're doing body parts more and she seems to i don't know if i'm just projecting on her that she's getting it more but like if i'll say where's the bunny's ears and she grabs the ears i just assume that's real you know .
whereas really it could just be that she likes the ears because they make a good sound .
but she's definitely like in the last month i've noticed a real growth spurt in terms of what she understands what she seems to be following and doing and what she associates with like the sound of the front door opening even if we're upstairs she'll immediately start crawling because she knows somebody's either coming or going .
and before she didn't really seem to connect that as much .
and .
if we say where's mommy where's daddy you know she'll look for us .
she says now .
she says which sometimes means i think i'm sleepy night night and sometimes i think means i'm hungry because she associates being fed with like sleep .
so she's starting to do more labeling but definitely more you know understanding of language and i think some of that if i'm like you're pulling on mommy's hair she'll laugh and kind of pull more .
so i think she's kind of getting some of that .
maybe ?
i do not know .
maybe i'm just projecting .
but she certainly is just like in front of my eyes seems more aware of things that are going on .
it's harder to trick her or get something past her .
you know like if she sees something she wants and before she even gets there if i have like real quickly put it away it used to be that she would just kind be like that's weird i thought i knew that was there .
now she looks at me and just knows .
i saw that .
and she'll start crawling around behind me until she finds it .
and then she's like i know .
i knew that was there .
don't even try to pull that past me anymore .
so like the blackberry the remote controls the phones in the house .
those are all really hard to sneak away anymore if she sees it it's like over .
but it's funny because i filled out that paper work .
and and we have a nanny who's home with her like three to four days a week .
and so i like to you know partner with her on this stuff .
and i want her to feel a vested interest in rosie's development and language and all this stuff .
so i always leave the paperwork with her and i'm like let's talk about this when when i get home .
like tell me if you agree or disagree with anything i put .
so you know the first time she was kind of like didn't really do it .
the second time she was like i think she does this and i'm like okay and then we you know we looked at or whatever .
and then the next day i said there's some things i didn't fill out why don't you try these with her and see if she likes them like putting a cheerio in the in the bottle and see if she'll go for it .
and so she got really excited about it .
the nanny was like this is cool !
so she was doing it and talking to me .
so this time i said okay here's all the paperwork let me know and when i got home she's like you totally underestimate your daughter .
she's like there is so much on here that she knows and does and i'm like really ?
she's like yes !
she knows her stroller she knows diaper she knows .
i'm like she does ?
she's like i mean abby she's like every single day i say to the kids okay we're going to go to the stroller and they crawl to the top .
and she's like now maybe they're just associating that with leaving but they know stroller means something .
and if i hand rosie you know if i say diaper she'll crawl over to me .
or if she thinks i'm going to change it she'll run away but she gets it .
so it was so funny because i was like okay .
so we went through this and and the nanny was so proud of herself because she was like right .
rosie does know a lot more than i have associated her with knowing .
so that was like both humbling like your nanny hasta tell you about your kid .
but it was also a good reminder that sometimes i think we're so used to what they don't know .
that we don't pick up the clues when they get it .
right .
so that's kinda been a a mommy epiphany i think .
well you also said that you you weren't sure you were projecting on her so you never know we use this all the time i don't know if she knows the word or knows the routine you know so .
right exactly .
it's hard .
so it's certainly she's picking things up and she's getting she's getting that figured out .
i sometimes worry because the other little boy in the nanny share is fifteen months .
and he doesn't really have any language yet .
and you know we're a good four months behind him but she's not around a a kid who's like talking to her or engaging with her .
and so that's why we really stress that we want the grownups who are around her to be creating a really language rich environment .
because you know the the little boy i mean the parents are kinda worried about it and they might start doing just like looking into if there's anything cognitive there they needta be thinking about but .
he's so advanced motor skills wise that i don't think they really worry about it .
and then all the sudden it's like okay but he's still not saying anything okay but he's still saying anything and .
so .
we'll see .
they can get you know checked out see what they say through the infants and toddlers program in their county .
we're in i don't even know if we have one .
i feel like is kind of .
i do not know either .
but but they're both doctors so i think they've they've looked into what kinda like first steps kinda thing would be around that they could look at .
he could just be a late talker .
you know ?
all of the sudden he'll string a phrase together .
i know .
well that would be really cool .
she is doing more like signs which is kinda fun .
like she'll do more .
and she'll do milk .
when she was sick she like went on a food strike for fifteen hours like she wouldn't eat she wouldn't .
and i was kind of like worried about it and we were getting ready to go to the doctor just to check it out .
and she was crying and she did the milk sign and i was like you're telling mommy that you do want to eat now you're hungry .
and she came right over and she nursed and i was like my god this is a language breakthrough .
rosie just told me what she wanted with out more than crying .
just like the first year it seems like it's just crying and you determine the cry .
what's in there ?
is that the horsie ?
do you feel the horsie ?
is that the lamb ?
yes .
like year right or something .
a year .
is it at two years that we come back ?
we'll call at twenty three months .
two years old .
okay .
and then we try to set something up by two years .
okay .
and that evaluation we just started our first round of those .
what's that like ?
what's that procedure .
it's lengthy .
it's about three hours .
okay .
and then we do like a series of standardized testing .
okay .
and but it looks fun .
it's not it's not the .
right .
it looks fun for them and there's snack time and bathroom breaks and stuff like that .
okay .
and so every every kids been kind of performing differently .
so we have so far we have one graduate clinician that is running it .
okay .
so like i'll i'll have to be trained on it and things like that .
so hopefully .
i'll be here this time next year so maybe i'll be the one .
that's so wild !
like what will she be like ?
i do not know it's going to be crazy !
but i mean a year has already gone so fast that i know the next one will be a blink of an eye too .
well cool .
well that'll be fun baby .
thank you so much .
we're going to leave that on .
i'm sorry right .
i'm sorry .
he still likes these silly food things .
do you have those at home ?
no .
so probably this is the only place he sees those silly food bits .
we do have .
he he went he went to the .
little bee guy .
no .
because we've w he's s recently been playing with a purple thing that has the same texture as those as is the bee's head .
so he thinks .
my shoes ?
he's going to eat your shoes .
he thinks that he thinks that's pretty wild .
he loves the .
texture of them .
what other stuffed animals did you think he ?
well he liked the froggie .
he's got two froggies at h two stuffed froggies at home .
he likes to pull on hair too .
so he liked the froggie .
do you think .
and he liked he liked this because he liked i think he was interested in either the eyes or the fact that he could maybe get them off .
he liked that too .
do you think he'd prefer to play with the books or the toys ?
he g at home he likes he likes to play with books .
he likes .
i didn't get to your peekaboo book .
but he does he enjoys the peekaboo books and like the touch and feel books .
i think the common thread still is things that he can chew on .
these things he chews .
he likes to chew !
do you think he has a preference for like which ones of those ?
no he seemed to like the .
i mean he's leaning towards the waffles .
but last time he liked the .
burger .
this time he still ate the burger too .
the pizza .
the pizza i think was good because he could get to his molars that i think are coming in .
haha that's convenient .
mostly the i f h he still likes the .
chewable things .
silly boy !
aren't you a ham ?
okay well i think we're good then .
i felt so silly last after last time i left that i hadn't offered him a doll .
like i'm like you know indepe well not ind whatever .
but you know .
what's the word ?
whatever .
you know i got a degree .
i got stuff .
i'm .
empowered woman .
didn't even occur to h me to give him a doll .
haha .
so i went home .
and told my husband ".
we needta get him a doll !
anyways .
that's great .
doesn't really like to play with it .
he pokes it in the eyes a little bit .
and and but he's got one so .
well because i was like ".
he should .
he should have one .
so now he's got one .
you like that waffle .
yes .
that's a winner .
so that's it i guess .
that's good .
well thank you for coming in .
sure .
and now we won't see him again until he's almost two .
i know that's crazy !
he'll be by then .
i guess they all will be right ?
when it gets closer to then we'll schedule an appointment .
okay .
and in the meanwhile .
i didn't listen to the thing !
well .
i'm sorry .
i can play it for you if you'd like .
is it is it too inconvenient ?
i'm just i'm just curious .
i was going to say .
do you want to be contacted for other studies in between ?
sure .
you've been coming here so often we try to keep him as as our own .
but now that it's a whole year we can kind of let the others .
sure .
share the wealth .
sure i think he has fun coming here .
okay .
okay .
good .
if you don't mind i'd like to ask some questions .
sure .
not going to be writing anything down because we're taping .
right okay .
so .
what do you think he enjoyed the most ?
the icecream cone probably .
it's good to put in his mouth and to chew on isn't it ?
they're very familiar .
i mean th the juice and the .
sippycups .
do you think he recognizes the .
that it's a i mean definitely .
he wasn't getting anything out of it but he certainly recognizes that it was something to drink .
so .
what other were there any other toys that you thought .
that he liked or ?
that he liked or preferred of of the other toys ?
i think he had fun with the food toys we don't .
what else ?
the .
i mean it seemed evident that the icecream cone was a hit .
what else did he like to play with ?
th the blocks these little things when we made a little tower that seemed like it was good fun .
and .
i think that's probably .
maybe the baby he definitely liked looking at he likes to look at paybee babies and point to their features and .
didn't seem that interested in the book but we have a similar karen katz book that he's interested that he likes to look at the babies in so the doll .
do you have dolls at home ?
we have one little doll he doesn't give a whole lot of attention to .
its but but books with baby's in it .
and he has a little he has a big brother that he plays with all the time so .
okay .
and the books does he prefer books over toys ?
i don't think so i think generally toys over books now at this point .
so he's .
and it doesn't doesn't have to be a you know he doesn't obviously use the toy in the intended way at this point anyway generally .
but any things toys measuring spoons .
bowls .
keys .
rocks you know .
so .
does he do you think he recognized the activity of that book that you read him ?
peekaboo ?
probably i mean we do peekaboo so .
and we have like i said i think we have a peekaboo karen katz book .
not that book but something i lift the flap something .
so i think so right right william wills .
william .
william .
what are you doing .
where .
what do you see .
felt that he was not .
not terribly interested in .
not in particular i think he'd be interested in anything .
there's a lot of toys here .
so i think when when .
i j i often find you know if there's just one toy he would be you know if if i were interacting with him with it he would probably be a lot more interested but there's a lot of toys here so .
i think any toy i think here he would probably interested in if there weren't other things to .
to distract him from do you know what i mean ?
and the animals toys did you use any of the .
not really i think i grabbed a little poodle at the end .
but he he doesn't he's not terribly interested in the animal toys .
i mean we have some stuffed animals but i don't notice him ever he's never taken like a special .
a special .
little you know stuffed animal to bed or he's not attached to anything like that .
so .
you mentioned you had .
the doll .
we have one doll it doesn't look anything like that i would say it's it's not it's a soft doll with a flat face that's much more realistic .
but yes we do have a my mother gave my first son a doll when he was born so we have that doll kicking around .
are there any other toys here that you also have at home or .
books .
books .
not the particular books we have good night moon .
like i said we have a karen katz book .
we and we have measuring spoons in the kitchen and sippycups for sure .
but other than that we don't have any other toy plates or food or things like that .
we have keys right ?
okay so .
i think i think that's pretty much it .
okay .
answered all the questions .
do you have any questions ?
nope .
no ?
what is this i mean what is general ?
who do parents are you do you videotape other moms or dads playing with their children how do they i'm just curious like i you know what how other people play or how .
i mean its just i guess it varies quite a .
it .
okay .
i think i think .
it's probably a different setting for everybody .
yes .
at home .
right right sure it's different how the children would .
it's hard to tell .
somebody just you know .
i'm not paying attention when i read because i want people to feel comfortable but .
usually i mean it's .
normal of what they do play they with i guess every kid is interested in a different toy .
you know .
yep .
so the .
the tower building and .
things like that usually .
parents only go first for the animal .
you all done with your with your bottle there wills ?
okay .
okay we gotta say bye to miss sabrina we've been still videotaping .
that's okay .
so what did you notice was different from last time ?
well different ?
which toys did .
we okay we didn't we didn't do the peekaboo book before .
and we didn't really use the pitcher for banging .
he always comes back to these .
cylinder kind of things .
but that was the first time he banged it on the the pitcher to get the noises .
he was .
always banging them together before .
never picked up the cookie before or the icecream .
and otherwise i think he went to the same things pretty much .
more or less .
so what items do you like the best ?
that was a definite good one and he liked the peekaboo book for a little while .
do you have that book at home ?
do you have anything like it ?
actually we don't and we .
played peekaboo a little differently at home .
we like cover him up with a little towel and he pulls them off himself and does peekaboo but .
no we actually we don't have anything like that .
do you play any other games like peekaboo with him and stuff ?
we tr we try and play peekaboo we try and play you know so big and .
and pattycake but so far he really hasn't i mean he thinks they're funny .
but he won't actually play along .
what do you doing bud ?
but he he laughs during them .
which items do you think he liked the least ?
the least ?
he never seems interested in the in the plush animals .
hi .
wait what did you do to your head ?
my goodness .
he wasn't really interested in anything unless it made noise .
he didn't seem very interested in this one when i tried to give it to him .
does he play with toys that make a lot of noise at home ?
he does he does .
he either makes the noise with blocks .
we have blocks and those little shapes that go into things .
so he makes the noise that way or we have toys that you know are electronic and have sing songs .
song songs or the alphabet .
so do you have food items at home ?
we do not .
i'm thinking we might needta because he won't eat food .
he won't pick up food and put anything in his mouth so the .
fact that he put that cookie in his mouth was actually kind of big because .
he doesn't he doesn't let us put anything in his mouth .
besides baby food .
like any pops or cheerios or anything like that he won't have anything to do with it .
until he figures out how delicious they are .
i know !
that's why i'm like not like i don't want to give him something sweet or that's all i'm ever going to get out of him .
right bud ?
but we don't have any food items at home .
do you have any of the same books ?
we have good night moon .
we have something similar to this one .
i don't know if it's this one it's a little bit different but it's similar to this one .
and that's it .
so you said a lot of the names of the objects would he recognize any of those names at home ?
no we haven't we haven't been able to figure out if he's if he knows any yet .
but .
i mean we tend to name them when we're playing with them .
but especially we don't have any of these things at home i'm sure he doesn't know any of the names .
are you going to stand up on your own ?
really ?
do that on video that would be cool .
so the toys that he chose do you think they match his personality ?
like making the noise and cylinder .
he likes things that he can really grab and things that he can bang together to make nosie .
or things that he can you know like this that he he likes to turn them around and see what they are .
so and he kinda pushed away the ones that were kind of just plain and weren't going to make a whole lot of noise .
or wouldn't fit in his hand well either i guess that would be the other thing he likes to he likes to be able to hold it and turn it around .
you know .
pasta we've tried pasta .
bread .
cheese little bits of meat .
cheerio type things .
some vegetables .
little bit of everything .
so far nothing .
occasionally we can we can sneak some in but we've been told it's kind of a texture thing he doesn't like the texture of it .
what you doing ?
go get that .
no baby dolls are at home or ?
other .
we have a lot of animals .
a lot of .
not necessarily s we have a few stuffed animals the only one's he's really been interested in has actually been a rather large panda bear .
and we do have a a little a little bear that he's a little bit interested in .
but in general he's right now his biggest thing at home is he .
and he didn't do it here which .
surprises me he takes whatever he can like a box or or you know we have this little remote thing that that says numbers .
and he pushes it around like a truck .
which he did not do here but that that actually is kind of a normal thing he'll take whatever he can and and try and push it around .
and then we .
we have a cat who is extremely tolerant that has also kind of become his toy .
what are you doing ?
so none of .
the animal names here today even though he didn't well i guess he didn't play with them .
do you think he would be familiar with any of it ?
i don't .
i don't think he'd be familiar with any of them .
we do like with the books we do noi animal sounds .
but i don't i don't see any recognition that he knows .
what animal it is .
but like rydan what does the cow say ?
the cow says .
usually he laughs when we do the noises but i i mean my husband and i were talking about it and we don't think he might recognize something physical we do like .
when we ask him to come here we might be in another room and tell him to come here and maybe the tone of our voice or or something like that he recognizes but we don't think he actually recognizes the terms yet .
anyway what are you doing ?
do you say any like words of encouragement like good job or .
usually usually .
especially when especially when he does something new we tend i guess to do it more when he does it the first time than .
after that but most of his play is pretty physical .
so he tends to want to stand and and roam around .
he get gets the you know the bowls out and the lids from the kitchen and bang on those .
what are you doing ?
there it goes !
where you going ?
ice cream ?
you're going to go help aren't you ?
are you ?
do you like papers ?
i wish i had i should have like a pretend record form .
for them to tear apart .
here you want the book it's kind of like it ?
hi !
your up .
you want to get look at that .
a pink one .
that's a dog .
he's pretty friendly ?
he goes to anybody .
that is so sweet !
well what do you think about how he's playing with the toys and what he's interested in compared to last time you were here ?
he's .
any differences ?
less interested in the stuffed animals this time till the very end there last time he was kind of equally interested i think .
and then .
the .
the books he likes the books more it seems this time .
but he's been reading a lot more books at home lately .
in you know his spare time .
was he so he looked like maybe he would like to turn pages ?
yes .
that's something in the last couple weeks he's started doing .
he'll pick up a book and starting flipping through and just looking at the pages .
right ?
right .
so he did like some of those then ?
the one with * m s the the touchy feely stuff and .
he likes those and then the lift flap books .
okay .
i think .
then he likes this stuff the hard toys in the middle .
and do you think that's why he likes them ?
i think there hard and there something he can pick up and bang together and .
and make knock down stacks that mommy makes .
come back here your quick .
aren't you quick come here .
mommy wants you she does .
come here can you walk to me ?
almost !
not in these shoes .
it's the shoes that are killing him .
i know !
he seemed the middle stuff the hard stuff he played with the most .
okay were there any items that he tended to like ?
the peas .
he always like the peas .
alright and anything else that he liked in particular ?
the ice creams and the peas just but i don't know if it's for color or familiarity or .
if it's familiar .
has he had anything like pizza ?
well he's had some bites of it but most of his are cut up .
so they don't look like this .
they don't look like this .
the peas are probably the one thing that look like what he's used to getting .
but look you have it now .
of course now you want the pizza .
and the cookie the cookie he likes the cookie .
okay .
has he so besides cut up pizza and peas has he tasted any of these other ?
the cookies the waffle .
hamburger i mean he's had a lot of the lunch meat and stuff .
spaghetti we've had spaghetti .
you're going to pizza on spaghetti ?
thank you !
you're a good sharer .
we'll switch .
there you go .
and the any of the plates and that the non food things ?
he eats off his tray right now so he's not plates go flying right so we don't mess with plates .
okay .
right ?
and he did like that ?
the pitcher he likes to put things in and out .
so it was less the pitcher as a function and more pitcher as a place to put things .
that sounds right that sounds right ?
and then do you did he recognize the bottle or sippy cup as something that you think he would've ?
he didn't seem too .
are there any of the food items do you think he's would recognize the names of ?
probably not .
okay .
and then let's see .
animals does he would he recognize the names of any of the animals ?
maybe doggie .
the doggie .
doggie and kittie are the only ones we really .
do a lot of at home so .
you were going through some there must be a book over there with farm animals ?
that was this one the feeling .
and do you think he would recognize any of those ?
probably not .
or the names of the either the pictures of them or the names .
we've told him the names of them in books and stuff like that i don't know .
if he would you know directly recognize .
if they .
familiarity .
he's heard them but maybe not a lot ?
exactly .
dog like i said doggie kittie and probably bird turtle things that he sees at friends houses and stuff like that we probably see the most .
and then any of the did was he interested in any of the unusual .
animals that we have here ?
that he probably would not have seen at a friend's house .
it didn't seem that way but .
of course i mean this is not exactly .
he's kind of unusual he has a hat on .
exactly .
not too many animals you see like that .
alright and then .
do you have i'm sure other people have asked you this before but i don't think i have anyway i don't remember .
if you have any toys like these at home or at daycare if he's in daycare ?
he's not in daycare .
we have books we have stuffed animals .
no fake food .
but lots of blocks and stuff he likes to stack .
he seemed to like that right ?
the knocking down ?
yes he loves making stacks and knocking them down .
okay .
thank you for the hug that was very sweet .
good kisses and hugs you're such a lovey .
thank you .
okay and so you told me what seemed different from last time .
is he playing with things differently than maybe last time ?
a lot more of the in and out .
thank you baby .
a lot more of the flipping of the pages in the books .
that's about it that's probably the biggest change in the last month is the you know just doing the more of the in and out .
so in and out of containers ?
yep .
you're lovey today what do you want ?
he's a nice boy .
is he tired ?
he does do that a lot but if he wants something he'll pretend like he loves you .
he does it to daddy all the time .
does that already ?
my goodness .
he'll give him he'll give daddy a hug to get closer to something .
well pretty smart boy ?
he says i like to think so .
peas and spaghetti .
peas and spaghetti .
but it is lunchtime so that .
i think i .
you want them back ?
did he look at the babydoll at all ?
he looks looked at her briefly he played with her more last time than this time .
bring it over here silly boy .
hi .
there we go .
where you going you going to try to walk again ?
hi .
so he looked at her more last time ?
i mean he looked at her and kinda just acknowledged her but didn't he doesn't you know want to play with her .
do you have any baby dolls at home ?
no we don't .
okay .
i think that's all .
no babies .
i think that's it .
i'm going to go ahead and turn this stuff off .
okay .
he won't be back till he's two .
no !
at least not for this study i should say .
we have .
playing and stuff .
thanks luc .
do you think anything's changed since the .
last time that you guys came in .
no actually .
she picked the same toys .
what kinds of things was she most interested in ?
the all the food .
food ?
so last time we came in she wanted all the food toys .
and .
she wanted the food toys again so .
does she play with those kinda toys at home ?
she does .
we have .
we have a lot of play food at home .
but we have the other stuff too we have books we have stuffed animals too she plays with all of them .
at home .
but i don't know .
it might be the play .
well i don't know the play food is in her brother's room .
so sometimes that's enticing .
do you think there are any of the foods that she might recognize ?
well she just ate a cookie before we got here so .
so and i think she knows the peas .
and then the cup she got real excited about .
because she's been learning how to drink out of a cup .
okay .
and she would know the pizza .
i think she gets all excited when we have pizza at home .
so .
cheese .
cheese cheese .
i don't know .
none of the .
some of them she wouldn't recognize like she wouldn't know .
the burger .
or some of the .
cans and boxes .
so .
which one would you say she was the most interested out of the different food ?
probably the spaghetti and th the spaghetti and the cup .
probably the cup she was most interested in .
okay .
so .
she was a little bit interested in the books .
i read her one or two books .
i think i got one book two books two i got one this book she she liked by the last page she was like i'm done .
and in this one she liked she's been liking like well she's been liking peek a boo books lately and then she's been liking books that have stuff you touch .
and again by the end she was real interested but then by like almost at the end she was like that's enough i'm going back to the food .
so shh but the stuffed animals she didn't really seem to care for so .
right .
she likes them they're okay at home like sometimes she likes them and sometimes she really could .
care less .
okay .
were there any ones here that she liked ?
i don't know none that i know she was all interested in the food so .
she would barely give them a second look .
you said she plays with the food mostly at home ?
she plays with the food well she plays with her brother's toys so .
and the food is in his room .
we have books all over the house so .
she plays with books at the house .
but the big toys she plays at our house are actually her blocks .
so .
does she have any dolls or anything ?
she has a couple she has .
okay .
she has actually she only has one .
she has one doll and my son has a doll .
we got him one when we were expecting her so .
but she'll play with them every once in awhile .
but her little baby she likes and she has a couple of stuffed animals that she particularly likes .
but she's not .
really .
attached to any of them .
let's see the one that she really likes is a little bear you like your bears .
yummy .
and she likes kitties .
she really likes cats .
a lot .
any cat she sees if it's a picture or a real cat or .
a stuffed cat she gets very excited about it because we have two cats .
so .
she gets real excited about the cats .
so .
her she really likes blocks .
and balls .
that's her other thing she really likes balls a lot .
okay i think that's .
all the questions that i have .
okay .
the peanut butter .
she's funny i know .
peanut butter's one of those things like we put it out on the table when she wasn't allowed to have it yet .
then we put it on the table and she just .
she could tell it was something that we liked .
and she's like .
she thought she could've had it .
and she couldn't have it but she's like !
like she was like i want it you know she was trying she was pointing at it and she wanted it and we were like you're not supposed to get it yet !
so i felt bad for her we're like you can't have it yet !
soon enough .
she gets it soon .
but when she plays the blocks at home we we for awhile she kept you know for awhile she was just she'd try to grab them and just you know wreck the tower whatever if like someone was building something she'd .
wreck it up .
but then we realized at one point she was trying to actually build .
she wasn't trying to destroy she was trying to build and she just couldn't do it .
so she would take a block like she would take a block and she would try to put it on but she didn't have the coordination to actually let it go it would the whole tower would knock over .
so we hadta tell my son we'd be like don't worry she's not trying to wreck it she's trying to help but she just can't do it yet .
trying to help .
and that kinda helped because he would get all upset if she wrecked up his stuff and .
and .
he realized that she was trying to not to help and not just wreck it up he was like !
okay .
but .
what do you think lucy ?
did you have fun ?
they have this thing .
okay so let's see .
so which of the toys did she seem most interested in this time ?
still the food .
she still seemed to be maybe i needta be feeding her more before she comes here .
she still went right to .
today she seemed to like that bottle a lot .
and and the peas .
okay and last time i can't remember i think .
last time it was that yellow that yellow box which she still picked up today .
the cereal box .
and and last time she went for the keys and the the measuring spoons too .
but haha .
what what did she seem .
what are you doing ?
she didn't even .
touch that pile .
look at that pile .
she didn't even after i showed her the pooh bear .
she didn't have any interest in that .
does she have i can't remember any of these items at home that she plays with ?
we do have i mean we definitely have books everywhere .
and the kids have a play kitchen .
they don't have a lot of food in it .
they have more like dishes and things .
haha look what you found !
and she's got a few stuffed animals and .
okay .
actually we have quite a few stuffed animals and dolls lying around the house too .
but she has a few in her crib just like .
two or three of them .
haha and she seemed interested .
she did seem really interested in that clock .
i don't know what it was about that .
maybe the colors ?
the colors .
you like that one !
she seemed to like touching these .
so you think it's more like the rather than the animals it's more the the fact that it's .
she she was .
you know really touching the the textures .
you were ?
is it soft ?
recognizes the names of any of these items ?
i don't know .
i i'm having a really hard time telling if she really you know understands words .
but she like if i say something does she look for it or .
or does she seem to really know what it is .
i'm not really sure if she does .
okay does she have like a favorite toy at home that she knows the n .
i think she knows bear .
she has a little stuffed bear .
and i think she knows bear .
do you know bear ?
i'm going to switch the microphone over .
haha ellie where's bear ?
where's bear ?
bear .
i think she even said i'm not sure .
but she seems to say .
sometimes she says it more consistently .
usually if they have like a favorite toy that usually where they start .
okay well i think we're done for today .
i'm going to go get the basket for her to pick a toy to take home .
okay !
i can take that microphone .
okay .
we look tired .
it's ten o'clock ?
so i know it wasn't very long ago that she was here but do you notice any differences in this play session ?
from which .
not really .
no .
really ?
she she .
last time i think she spent more time on the stuffed animals .
than the food stuff but .
does she know a lot of those animals like ?
not really .
no .
i mean we don't she's got stuffed animals at home but mostly bears .
so she doesn't have a lot of stuffed animals i mean of different kinds .
and we have a lot of unusual ones .
the donkey and .
careful .
this has gotta stay .
no no .
it stays right there .
no no .
no .
no .
no .
no .
you don't have to write everything down .
and it will still pick up what you say .
okay so you didn't notice any big changes except for that she spent you said some more time .
yes she was more interested in the food stuff .
i mean she played with the food stuff last time but she was more interested last time in the stuffed animals i think .
okay did she have any favorite animal last time ?
i don't remember .
like you said she .
i think she did .
i think the goose .
interesting .
maybe i was going to guess maybe dog because you said she liked that book about the dog .
but they don't look that much like dogs .
i don't remember .
i know i think there was one but i can't remember .
which one .
she didn't seem too interested this time and i i .
i don't remember last time her being overly interested in it .
okay .
but i think did you show her that today ?
no she looked at it .
i didn't i didn't pick it up or anything .
okay .
she kinda picked it up and tossed it aside .
okay .
to get to what she wanted .
okay .
so .
much more into carrying things now .
even then it was just a couple of weeks ago that we .
were here .
and much more into carrying things and throwing .
what did she like to carry around ?
the pizza .
the spaghetti .
spoons .
she loves spoons .
no throwing .
no throwing .
okay .
she does okay .
she knows spoon .
she she tried to like scoop up the spaghetti with the spoon .
she she actually when we feed her she won't eat baby food anymore .
she wants big people food but she hasta have a spoon and she tries to .
feed herself with it .
hasn't quite managed it yet but she'd trying .
right ?
independent .
very .
does she eat peas or ?
she loves peas .
pizza .
spaghetti .
noodles of any kind .
veggies fruit .
how about the dessert stuff ?
she she's never seen ice cream like this .
okay .
but she does like ice cream .
okay .
don't throw it .
and let's see .
and then did she look at the baby at all or the books ?
ignored them completely .
how about how does she those things at home or does she have ?
she well at home books are all over and .
she she looks at them .
baby dolls are a big battle between her and her sister so they usually want if .
jackie's carrying it around she wants it but i guess without jackie being around to introduce the babydoll she's like .
i don't know .
she .
she has she has this little babydoll that's only about that big that she loves to carry around .
you want to sit ?
so she does carry a lot around ?
okay .
yep .
and like you said there's books all over the place does she show an interest in those ?
does she turn the pages or .
likes to carry them ?
she likes books she tries to eat them .
don't you ?
let's see .
are there any other favorite toys that she has at home that we don't have here ?
push thingies like walking .
thingies like that kinda stuff but .
her .
and i noticed you .
her .
were singing winnie the pooh .
does she have watch any of that ?
she .
sometimes her favorite is mickey mouse clubhouse .
but she does she watches tigger and friends .
or my friends tigger and pooh whatever that winnie the pooh one on is on .
but .
she her big sister watches a lot of cartoons .
so she she watches them with her sometimes .
sure .
alright .
is she just as mobile now as she was two weeks ago ?
pretty much .
she's getting a little bit faster but .
okay .
she was good about not going for the cords i was .
wondering if she was going to do that .
what are .
hi .
you going to climb on .
all done .
maybe you're all done .
i think i asked you everything .
okay .
if there was anything i didn't ask about that you saw that she was interested in just let me know that .
i'm hoping so .
she definitely was more into the walking over them .
last time i think she just walked like a little bit but .
well i know does she pour anything ?
cause you were using the pitcher with her .
i don't think she does .
but when they get a bath my husband uses pitcher kinda thing to wet their hair .
but i don't think she pours .
okay .
right .
she's curious .
that's it .
alright that was great .
i just have a few questions .
okay .
what toys did you think that luke liked to play with the most ?
anything food related .
he loved the pizza wedges the most .
does he have similar toys at home ?
his actually his brother does and i think he maybe recognized that from before .
does he like to play pretend with the foods ?
he's just starting to .
so he's just starting to get more active on that part .
before he wasn't as interested .
so i think these last few weeks he's really starting to come around and realize what the food means .
he started to practice with the spoon and he he can feed himself with his fingers .
what do you think he likes the least ?
it's hard to say he didn't really get too far from this range .
he didn't really seem too interested in the book i read him .
only held his attention for a short time .
what book did you read him ?
we read peekababy .
do you like to read at home ?
yes we do read at home a lot .
okay what books do you have at home ?
what's his favorite ?
quite a few .
we have a lot of the doctor seuss books the little card the little board books a lot .
that i read with his brother too so we usually read as a family .
a lot .
buddy .
does he usually play with dolls at home or no ?
no since they're just the two boys they don't are not really exposed to dolls as much .
we do go to playgroups but i don't think he's noticed so .
that's why i thought this time i would see what he would do and he was kind of intrigued for a second but that he wasn't as didn't keep his attention too long .
is there anything that you remember him playing with last time that you thought he had the same interest in ?
no i he was all over the keys last time and i don't even know if he s didn't see them because they were by under the books but he he played with new things this time .
what else so he didn't play with any of the same things this time ?
i think the only thing we did the same was maybe read this book .
and i think the toy order might have been a little different .
so i do not know if that might have been why .
i don't remember how the layout was exactly .
do you think he recognizes any of the foods ?
like does he does he eat any of these foods at home ?
no he's not onto solids yet he's still on baby food .
but he does i notice he does want to try to put them in his mouth so i think he's maybe getting that correlation that it is food though .
do you think maybe he recognizes food that you eat ?
i'm sure .
because we eat a lot of like pizza and that kind of stuff because of his brother .
what did you find buddy ?
a spoon ?
which of the animals did he seem to like ?
the only thing he really played with was with the bee word .
we watch the show at home so i know he knows these a lot .
but he didn't really show any interest in any of the other ones .
and i showed him the frog but he didn't gear towards it i hadta prompt it .
do you have any animals at home ?
you mean as far as pets or stuffed animals ?
either .
we don't have any pets we have tons of stuffed animals so he plays with those a lot at home .
which one's his favorite ?
at home ?
probably it's his teddy bear that's also his security blanket it's like attached .
so he's usually plays with that the most .
you did great .
thanks so much for coming in .
you're welcome .
it's kinda fun to play with him by ourselves .
we usually have his brother to contend with so .
it's a great opportunity then .
you gotta play by yourself without your brother snapping stuff away from you .
what you do you think she was most interested in today ?
well i'd say the peas and the dog .
was there any particular dog that she liked ?
the the one with the pink collar .
yes .
that and th do you think that there's any reason that she likes peas in particular ?
she loves peas .
okay .
i mean definitely of this food the peas would be the thing that i think she would recognize as something she eats at home .
and she loves them .
so .
i don't know .
maybe that's it .
i mean they're kinda realistic relative to the others .
right .
and she tries to eat them so .
they do look more foodlike .
was she interested at all in any of the other .
she there was a little milkshake that she was interested in from time to time .
and she tried talking on the cheese like it was a cellphone .
and she looked at other stuff .
she liked the pitcher .
she like tried put things inside the pitcher .
i thought there were some measuring spoons here .
she looked at the measuring spoons .
she liked to shake those .
hi .
does she play with anything similar to these things ?
like especially the food items at home ?
she has a little picnic set .
it's plush so i think tactically it would be very different .
and i'm not sure she would recognize the similarities .
you know what i mean ?
to me or you it's like fake food .
but but i think it's it's very different from the plastic stuff .
right .
she she has some play dishes .
i mean she has her own dishes that are plastic .
that are similar to these but just a little bit bigger .
that she plays with .
does she have any babydolls at home ?
she has one very small one that's more similar to these than that one .
she got kind of scared when .
did she ?
i mean not really but but she had the bottle and i was trying to show her that the bottle belonged to the baby and she was not pleased with that .
not pleased, ?
did she think it was hers do you think ?
i think she did .
i think she did .
i think she sees the babydoll as threatening .
that's really interesting .
because it's almost as big as she is you know ?
she's small for her age .
and that's a big doll ?
that's a big doll .
and you were giving it to someone else .
yes .
one other thing that i thought was funny .
was that she liked all the stuffed animals .
but she definitely recognized that that little brown one with the pink furry thing as a dog .
and she she howled at it .
which my husband taught her to howl with the dogs .
so she was like communicating with the little dogs .
so she must have known that was a dog .
i think so .
i think so .
that's interesting .
because it doesn't look that much like a dog .
well not that much .
it has the four legs .
and we have yorkies at home who are really small and .
got it .
got it .
heidi where'd you shoe go ?
does she express any interest in books ?
she she did .
she likes books .
she loves them at home but i think there were so many other distractions here but .
she liked this one .
and she loves the pet and feel book .
she has some of those at home ?
so have her interests changed since she was here ?
i know she was here pretty recently .
i don't think so .
i mean i think they probably change a little bit day by day .
you know just what her mood is and what's more interesting in that moment .
but but i wouldn't say that her interests have changed really .
she's i noticed that she's maturing very quickly it seems to me .
like she's developing quickly and is able to do things that wasn't able to do and is more expressive and communicative .
and is better able to let me know what she wants .
but i don't think her wants are really different from what they've been .
they're just she's better able to .
to express them .
do you think she's playing differently than she was with the toys ?
i don't remember well enough to to say really .
if she was you might remember .
i mean i think maybe last time we had a little bit more success just reading books all the way through .
and now she was just a little more interested in everything else that was going on around .
she seems like she gotta all the groups .
she did .
she did .
so you read a little bit to her with the book that she picked out .
we almost finished that one .
and we got about half way through the book .
and i think that's it .
so there was some interest .
at home when we read we you know sit down in a chair and read through four books at a time .
and she's she's really into it .
but but you know it's not in an environment like this where she gets to choose what she wants to do .
right .
shoes .
shoes are off .
i think that's it .
unless there's anything that you noticed that i didn't ask you about .
i don't think so .
say thank you !
so next time she's going to be two .
two !
you're going to be practically a grownup !
i know !
here i'll just that off so you can take it off .
practically a grownup !
is it okay if i ask you some things ?
please .
ask us some questions .
so what do you think she liked the most ?
the food still .
she still hasn't .
really gone near anything .
besides the food .
like all three visits .
she just loves the food .
i don't know .
she likes to eat .
do you have the .
stuffed animals ?
we have stuffed animals at home .
we have books at home .
we have those some of those books at home .
we have play food .
but it's been put in the basement .
since before christmas .
because the christmas tree went there .
but she really .
like she went right for the pizza .
the first thing .
she hasn't touched a nonfood item practically .
since we've been in here .
she played with a little while seal .
a little bit .
i even brought .
the baby over .
cause you said sometimes they like the baby .
she gave the baby a bunch of stuff .
well that's good .
she's she's that giving .
i give it to you and then you give it back to me .
and then i give it to you and then you give it back to me .
so we're we're at that phase .
but .
she still seems to have no interest for anything else .
besides the food .
does she do you think she recognizes the name ?
as familiar with some of the names of the food ?
i don't know .
i know she eats peas .
at home .
but we don't feed her pizza .
so i don't know .
she's eaten spaghetti .
she seems to like the spoons .
which she gets spoons at home .
but she doesn't drink juice at home .
so it's food but not food that we i guess normally would eat .
or that she would normally eat .
she eats cheese at home .
but she didn't touch the cheese .
she eats a lot of bread .
she loves bread .
but didn't really touch the bread either .
and she does love keys .
but who doesn't ?
who doesn't love keys ?
does she play with your keys ?
no .
they're pretty away .
she has her own keys to play with .
well my keys are lost in the car right now .
but .
someplace at the police impound lot .
so .
we're going to go back when it's warmer and look for them again .
you doing so good .
you such a big girl .
do you want to play with something else ?
no ?
you like that spoon ?
what's going on ?
is she playing with dolls at home ?
no .
nope .
she's got stuffed things at home .
one kind of looks like a doll .
but no .
she plays mostly with blocks .
and .
cars .
and books .
she does play with the books more at home than she does here .
we have some that have pictures of babies in them and she seems to like those a lot .
she likes to put everything up to her head .
like it's a telephone .
that's kinda funny .
but mostly it's blocks .
she really likes blocks .
and she likes to pull things out of stuff .
so like all the toys are in a big bin .
and she'll sit there and she just pulls them out .
she likes to take them out and then sometimes she'll put them back in .
but .
doesn't matter what's in the bin .
she just pulls it out .
and she loves magnets right now .
so she discovered that she could take the magnets off the fridge and she could put them on the dishwasher .
or if they come off the fridge and you put them back on the fridge .
so we're at a .
the magnet you know .
do you like it ?
but she likes the magnets .
you do .
are you .
doing kind of like you know does she know ?
does she know kind of like .
no .
we haven't been doing that yet .
we haven't .
we're trying to get some of the sign language going .
because now i mean .
i can kind of move my arm a little more now .
we were staring before the accident .
and now we're we're trying to start back up again .
cause we did it with nathan .
i don't know if it helped at all .
but we did it with him .
okay .
now we're going to make a mess .
she's happy while we're talking .
she's she's very good at playing independently you know .
she'll be happy to sit with a pile of stuff .
and play with it .
where nathan .
didn't like to do that .
so i don't know if it's cause you're second or cause you're a girl or cause you're just different .
i don't know .
i don't know .
do you think does is she eating out like using a spoon or just .
no .
i mean she'll hold onto it .
but she can't use it yet .
but she's self feeding with just fingers .
so she likes to do it herself .
so she likes cubes of cheese .
pieces of banana .
we've done rice kind of mushed up .
anything that she can pick up .
cooked carrots and pieces .
she like peas a lot because she can pick them up .
and then you know .
she'll change her mind .
and decide that she doesn't want anymore peas anymore ever .
does she pick up each individual pea ?
or do you .
okay .
it takes like forty five minutes to eat a meal .
and she eats like four meals a day .
so that's a long time .
we're in the high chair a long time .
and she eats each bite .
and then she plays a little bit .
and then she eats a little more .
and then she plays .
where'd it go ?
no .
no .
that was amazing .
do you want to go get it ?
you can go get it .
she's nice .
she's nice lady .
you can go get it .
i'll help you .
i'll help you come on .
you can go .
i'm helping you .
come on .
you have to take a step .
come on .
you can do it .
there you go .
okay one more step .
what a big girl .
what a big girl .
you such a big girl .
that was excellent .
that was excellent .
and she's .
getting teeth so her appetite's a little different now .
she wants it a little blander .
so .
like lots of just plain bread .
plain bread .
plain bananas plain plain .
did she play with the bread here ?
no she didn't and that's what's really weird .
because she loves bread .
loves bread .
is this how she sees it ?
pretty much .
i mean we we kind of .
tear it up into little pieces .
but she knows like when you get a piece of bread she knows .
alright .
and .
she won't .
she won't eat anything else .
if she sees you go for the bread .
she will not eat anything else until she gets that piece of bread .
so .
bread muffins noodles .
anything carbohydraty .
granola bars .
it's just like those oatmeal cinnamon bars kind of thing .
loves those .
thank you .
did you put the pizza on the plate ?
it's upside down .
is she eating cookies ?
even the like not so much like cookies but .
she eats cookies .
good she didn't touch them .
i don't know if we had shown her the m&m cookies .
but she would i would that she would recognize the shape .
and the size are similar .
i know .
whoopsies what you doing ?
that's the floor .
there you got a plate .
we don't give her plates yet .
okay .
then things just kind of end up on the floor .
what do you think she's .
liking about these plates here ?
i don't know .
maybe she she likes anything really that she can pick up .
if she can pick it up .
she likes it .
what you doing ?
you being all crazy .
did you lose your binky ?
she does like to pick things up .
she likes .
do you think that she knows what her binky is ?
yes .
the name binky ?
she knows what it is .
i don't know if she knows the name .
but she knows .
if she sees it and she wants it .
she makes it very clear .
you like that spoon .
where you going ?
this is a new thing too .
she crawls and carries it .
and you said she kind of just holds the spoon .
yep .
when she's eating ?
she can .
we normally don't let her though .
it gets messy .
hate to say it but a lot of things that she could do .
she doesn't do .
because they're just too messy for mommy .
you having fun ?
she likes to hit .
did she play with the measuring spoons too ?
she didn't today .
did you play with those ?
do you want to go look at the measuring spoons ?
what do you think ?
they make noises like keys .
what are you doing ?
gotta get that spoon .
here let's get the measuring spoons .
mommy's going to get the measuring spoons .
it's over here .
let's get these .
what do you think of these ?
what do you think ?
those are exciting .
where you going ?
what are you doing ?
so the last time she played with food as well .
she's played with food every time .
every time .
and the first time i tried really hard to show her everything .
did you say though the last time that you had purchased a food kit ?
we've already we've had one but it was in the kitchen .
and that's she wasn't really crawling yet so i moved it from the kitchen to the living room .
because she seemed to like playing with it here .
but then christmas came and then i took it out of the living room completely .
so she hasn't really .
had access to ours .
again mostly at our house she plays with the blocks .
and the trucks .
and .
anything that's inside of her like bin .
rattles keys and again she doesn't really play with the item .
she takes it out she kind of looks at it she puts it down .
she'll pick it up she'll put in back in kind of thing .
it's an out and an in thing .
there we go .
what's over there ?
what's over there ?
you dropped your spoon .
can you get it ?
that's very good .
i think .
no she didn't get it i thought she got it .
there you go .
good job .
but it'll be interesting to see what she does when she's two years old .
when she comes back and .
well that's next visit right ?
we might have a different phone number then .
would you like my cell phone number ?
do we not have that on file ?
i have no idea .
okay .
but it's nine seven three .
five eight zero .
okay .
you want your peas ?
peas .
you can play while we talk .
with the toys .
and not the big girl toys .
the little girl toys .
she was here just very recently and i don't remember i was in the play session or not but anyway maybe you can just tell me any observations you have about if she's playing with different toys or if she's playing differently than last time ?
basically the same she loves this plastic play food .
and like she at home her favorite thing is books but i really she doesn't care about the books here .
because she has this cool stuff .
because like i said before she's obsessed with food like she's really into eating .
she begs like a dog at the table for just scraps of food so i guess anything that .
so do you think she thinks that those look like food ?
looks like it's edible .
like would she recognize any of those items as food that she's had at home or she's seen you guys eat ?
i'm not sure .
maybe the peas .
but i do not know if it's just the texture might feel good on her on her gums .
but i know that she recognizes this for a bottle and she recognizes this for a sippy cup because she's like .
so .
and she knows that these are cookies i'm pretty sure .
any of the other foods that you think shh .
she's been exposed to ?
i don't think so .
and how about the utensils and things like that does she have anything like that at home or play with real ?
she has measuring spoons that she doesn't really i mean she kinda clacks around with them for thirty seconds and then .
but i guess the thing she's into now is putting stuff into things .
so last time she didn't put things in things like she did this time .
and remove them .
like she'll just sit there at home and put things in boxes and take them out over and over again .
and she did that here .
so .
so that's .
that's neat .
i would say .
very cool .
she didn't look at the stuffed animals is that right ?
no she doesn't .
care about stuffed animals .
okay .
does she have any stuffed animals at home ?
she has a lot .
does she like them ?
no .
she just doesn't care .
how about baby dolls does she have any baby doll at home ?
she has a baby doll at home and she likes to lick and kiss on it's face .
but i couldn't get her to do that maybe because this one is kinda scary looking .
no .
there we go .
there we go much better .
but i do not know if she .
do you like babies ?
okay .
but she's more into like i guess working on her moving her motor skills than playing now .
like she doesn't care about toys if she can move around .
in general .
so .
that sorta makes sense for this age too .
that's more common .
like .
so you said at home she does have a lot of books and she likes she likes them ?
yep .
does she like to turn the pages herself ?
and does she have favorite ones ?
like that she would go and get for you to read to her or ?
i think pat the bunny .
what did you find ?
what is it ?
what is it ?
well that's her favorite thing is to find .
i don't know where you found that .
find scraps .
i don't see any more .
thank you .
any more ?
what are you doing ?
finding all the stuff that shouldn't be there ?
yep .
i don't need a vacuum cleaner any more .
how do you do that ?
how did you do that ?
tell me .
what do you like to play with ?
i love a baby this age .
it's fun .
it is fun .
you're fun .
you keep mom busy i bet .
so she's interested in doing moving around type of stuff and she probably has toy different toys at home that she likes too that she doesn't that we don't have here ?
like pushing toys or ?
she has like a little push wooden push wagon thing that she likes to use up and down the hallway .
and .
basically anything that's not designed to be a toy she prefers .
like toilet paper tubes and candy wrappers .
just .
that kind of stuff .
my laptop she likes to type on the keys .
so i got her like a i got her she has a keyboard that she just kind of like bangs on .
so do you think that she's imitating you ?
yep .
are there any other differences between what she was sort of doing here and what she does at home in terms of play ?
she doesn't stay very focused on her toys at home .
like she would have already been up in the time that we were i was sitting here playing with her she would have been up twice and left where she was .
and found another thing of toys in another room .
okay so she's more active in general is what you're saying ?
i think that's it .
all i have to ask you if there's anything you think i missed .
no i don't think .
i think that's pretty good .
you did a good job .
you are capable of moving around .
so now i'm going to ask you some .
questions yes .
that's good .
she's all over the place .
she is .
i know you guys always want to know what do i think is her favorite .
yes so what you think was her favorite ?
that's a tough call probably the baby .
and she always loves the food .
i tell i think i tell you guys every time i think it's just because we have so much of it at home it's all over the place you know because we have the kitchen with the older daughter and .
so this kind of stuff is she sees it a lot it's everywhere .
not necessarily the exact same things but similar ones you know ?
plastic food .
she sees plastic food a lot .
plastic food .
she plays with that like her sister's always trying to feed her plastic food , you know what i mean , make meals for her and that kinda stuff .
so she sees plastic food a lot .
and in the past she's always loved the keys .
so i said even to her right away look somebody has the keys apart this time because they usually they're on a .
and she loves the jingling the the noise they make .
that and like these spoons .
if the spoons were all connected she would have right away gone to those two .
she didn't even touch these .
because they're all separated .
i thought that was very interesting .
because she loves anything that makes a noise that she can jangle like that .
so she loves the keys and the spoons when they're together and i noticed they were apart this time that was very interesting .
i wonder if that's because they're older just to see what they do with them .
i don't know why that is .
ha !
maybe .
that's why i said maybe someone tore them apart .
like you .
like a destructor baby like you .
because they have been on a a ring in the past and there's the other one .
so maybe it was just a fluke .
maybe it wasn't supposed to be on purpose .
i don't know .
that's kinda funny .
and here's all these little spoons usually are connected too .
or at least they have been .
now the food she saw plastic food do you think she recognizes does she see those real foods like does she see pizza .
pizza she does yes .
peas .
she hates peas but she hasta eat them .
icecream .
she does love regular icecream .
she kept picking up the jar of peanut butter which i thought was interesting because she's never eaten peanut butter .
and i it's not like i she would i don't you know she's not even really around when i'm making a peanut butter sandwich for her sister you know ?
so that she definitely doesn't .
the bottle and the juice both she tried to drink herself you know ?
with both right away .
the pizza she's fascinated with them i don't know why .
because we don't eat pizza with any of that stuff on it at our house .
i don't know if it's because it has a lot of the colors .
do you think that she knows it's pizza ?
i don't know .
i don't know .
i i wish i knew i don't know .
she might but i just don't know .
because she will eat pizza .
hi .
she loved reading the books she likes the fuzzy book .
she does like that .
and she loved the baby i've never it's the first time she's ever leaned in and given it a kiss .
that was the first time we had ever done that she gave .
the baby a kiss .
didn't you ?
you gave the baby a kiss .
and i asked the other girl i had asked the other girl before i came in i said do you want me to like try and get her to talk like in her words or do you want me to just not .
you know i don't want do you want me to not influence her ?
and she said whatever i wanted to do is fine .
because she talks like all the time and we have like conversations like .
now what is she .
you know like it's just a sound she makes .
and so we just imitate it back to her all the time and so then we have these conversations in language i call them .
and she starts .
she started it yes it was all it was her starting it .
and and .
but see like i'll say to her and then she'll go , you know what i mean ?
so i influenced her and started it here but she came up with the word herself i don't even know when a long time ago .
and .
and that's just kinda .
what is that and it will refer to whatever you're doing ?
anything exactly whatever you're doing at the time yep .
cause i noticed you .
anything in any situation yep .
right .
so now it's just a word that she just uses .
it's just a madeup word she uses for anything yep .
when she to replace whatever she can't say .
because she really only says like momma dada baba and baby .
she's pretty talk talkative .
baby .
addressed to the child .
baby .
baby .
yes you're the baby .
now so the food was definitely the big hit and she has that stuff at home ?
and then you noticed she kissed the doll this time .
does she play with dolls at home ?
she does but not .
a ton but she does have them .
we do have them at home and she does play with them at home .
she does like the babydolls at home too .
a baby .
baby .
a baby .
she hasn't ever like tried to tear the clothes off or dress them or undress them yet or anything like that .
but she picks them up and carries them around you know and they're dragging by their feet and stuff like that she does .
whenever like they have little high chairs her sister puts them in the high chairs and she'll pull them out .
she puts them in the stroller she pulls them out .
you know ?
and she's fascinated by their hair a lot of time she's like .
you know pulling out their hair .
i said that's because you don't have any .
that's because you don't have any of your own .
see we're still playing with the food i don't i don't know why .
and the books were .
you're klutzy !
this one i know she likes .
i think i did the same ones as last time because i know she likes them .
and the peekaboo baby one .
she because i knew they capture her attention .
she would have for a couple minutes but she prefers the interactive stuff at this age .
she would have you know gotten up or hit me or thrown it or pulled it away from me or something .
because she'll sit like when i read her sister books at night she'll she'll sit for the first few minutes of it and then she's squirming or grabbing at it or wanting to put it in her mouth or you know because it's a a more advanced book you know ?
from what her sister would pick or something so .
but she's sitting longer and longer you know it's getting a little bit better she'll sit for a little more of it .
and i know that gets better with age too .
but these those two are so good because the feeling and then the peekaboo .
and do you have any of these ?
i we have some of those i don't think she's ever touched them though .
i don't know if we even have those exact two .
we have good night moon not the counting one .
we have the regular good night moon .
she's heard that one the peekaboo we don't have it but we've had it at the library .
and then the feely one we actually were playing with a little boy yesterday while sissy was at soccer who had the a book very similar and had feely stuff in it so that's why so we did this book yesterday .
it wasn't ours though we just it was just borrowed so we don't have that .
right ?
we don't have that one .
now the clock i didn't know if she'd be interested or not just because of the feel of it foamy .
she looked at it for a few minutes but then .
nothing there to capture her too much whereas her sister would have loved it she's interested in telling all of the time even though she has no concept of it .
she's always like what time is it mommy ?
and i'm like do you have somewhere to go ?
what do you have a date ?
i'm like it's two o'clock why ?
when will it be five o'clock ?
in three hours .
is that a long time ?
i'm like in my world not really but in your world probably .
in your world probably .
you know ?
and what about .
the animals ?
the stuffed animals ?
i tried a little bit with her but she didn't she didn't seem to want to pick them up and play with them herself though .
we have a whole bin of those things at home though and the girls don't play with them a whole ton .
usually they're just thrown all over you know just to empty them out just to throw them but they don't play with them a lot .
they don't treat them like a babydoll or anything like that .
but we have lot's of those don't we ?
so i tried to .
do a little bit of everything just to see what she would prefer .
obviously her favorite thing is walking .
yes .
walking around all over the place .
she really likes things that play music make noise .
so everything is so interactive now because everybody's so a d d i guess .
she loves all the stuff with the lights and noise and we have a lot of those kinds of things .
mostly hand-me-downs from sissy but they were .
and she's a dancing baby .
aren't you ?
are you a dancing baby ?
whenever she hears music .
can you show your dancing ?
you want to do dancing baby ?
can you do dancing ?
shake your butt do your dancing baby .
because we have the ones that are like the magnetic things on the fridge and if you push the button it you know sings a song .
i see you dancing .
dancing right ?
you'll just shake that whole butt of yours won't you ?
so if you had had any toys like that in there she would have liked those too you know .
like a light up kind of thing interactive .
with music buttons are good she would have loved anything like that too .
this is the good old-fashioned stuff though right ?
this is the good old-fashioned toys .
crazy .
say crazy .
what do you see ?
what do you see ?
water bubbler .
so she was really she had a look at everything .
but it was mostly the food ?
mostly the food and the baby .
the food and the baby got the .
and then those two books she did enjoy .
that was good .
but we're working on it .
that's funny .
that's what the baby does .
so this .
you know tambourines .
so that's those types of toys are her favorite so we didn't have any of her favorite but we did have ones that .
those are the kind of stuff she loves yes .
she's perfectly fine .
well you know what ?
perfectly entertained .
okay .
so which of the toys do you think seemed to interest her the most ?
she liked the measuring to shake the measuring spoons and the the keys .
do you guys do you play with those at home ?
why do you think that interested her ?
actually i think she likes them because they make noise .
you can shake them .
and which toys do you think she likes the least ?
stuffed animals .
and why do you think that is ?
does she play with stuffed animals at home or .
not a lot .
and most of the stuffed animals she has a at home are are bigger too .
which foods would you say she was the most attracted to ?
the waffles .
she picked those up right away .
and then the cookies .
and what about the books do you do you think she's interested in them or .
when we first came in she went straight to the books first .
and then she got distracted by the other stuff .
and is there anything here that she's never seen before or does she have all this stuff at home ?
we don't have any play food at home .
or baby or or baby dolls like this .
she just has like they're kinda like stuffed animal baby dolls .
they don't really look real .
do you that might be why she was not as interested in these ?
well and she once i showed her how to do i guess do the bottle and the cup she tried to feed the baby a little bit .
she thought that was interesting .
okay and do you normally like read these books to her at all ?
has she ever seen these before ?
no we don't have i don't think any of these books at home .
we have i guess the regular good night moon .
but no we don't have any of these specific books at home .
okay do you think she recognizes the names of anything ?
she knows dog .
she she might know baby .
but she might think that's herself .
she's so funny .
so she likes to play with the fake food at home too ?
we don't have any fake food at home .
no because she's a little bit young for it still .
does she she doesn't eat waffles at home right ?
no she doesn't .
no .
she she really doesn't eat much of any of this at home .
okay well i think that's all the questions that i have .
do you have any questions ?
i think that's it thank you so much for coming in .
i love her hair .
i know she's a little puffball .
and the ear rings too .
so cute .
you stacking them up ?
its her new favorite thing is stacking .
sure .
that kind of stuff .
i think we have enough of you guys playing together .
okay .
you going to show judy the bee ?
you're almost carrying it like a a doll maybe .
he he doesn't have a lot of .
a whole lot of stuffed animals i guess .
he has a few .
but this is a new things where he gets really excited .
and it's like straining to be excited .
it's very funny .
so there he goes .
that's why it's it's kind of strange to .
play with him in in this setting to see what he wants .
because we're so active and we do a lot of like chasing around the house and .
different kind of playing .
so he does play with toys .
don't get me wrong .
but it's much more physical .
in a way .
sitting and playing quietly is really not what you do at home .
no .
but you said he does .
but he does .
he does do that like with in some independent play .
he has blocks at home .
and we will build towers .
and he tends to knock them down .
which was why i was surprised that he didn't knock it over right away .
he doesn't have a baby doll .
so and obviously he's an only child .
he doesn't .
have .
a baby .
a baby .
not that we know about .
and so i mean he likes s he it's kind of funny how he fixated on that bottle .
he doesn't use a bottle .
ever .
i mean well not ever .
but he i breastfeed him .
and then he drinks from a glass .
he doesn't even really use a sippycup .
we tried .
but he just focuses on it kind of like that .
so it d is not very helpful .
right that's interesting .
so are you saying so he spent a lot of with the bottle ?
okay you liked the bottle .
he liked the bottle .
and he seemed to like that pile of spaghetti .
which is .
somewhere around here ?
it's over here .
okay .
but i don't know .
was there anything different from last time ?
i'll sit over there .
no sweetie don't do that .
was there anything that you think he he was interested in this time that he wasn't interested in last time ?
i don't .
no chords .
i don't remember what he did last time .
i think i think i feel like last time he was more into the books .
than the plastic food stuff .
but this time it seemed to be .
you know what he's doing .
although it might also be because he's teething .
i saw that it looked like he has some new ones coming in .
he got these two .
and now he's got another one coming in at the bottom .
and i think he's got a couple more that are .
poking through .
so is that what you think is going on with the some of the hard things ?
that's what i think .
and that's why maybe the bottle was really appealing because it's got a hard nipple thing on it .
right that makes sense .
he was but he liked a little bit of the stuffed animal play ?
i mean i think that he .
you know he likes that .
where'd that bee thing go ?
he likes this because i think he likes the rubber part of it with .
and .
it's exciting !
and you read a little bit ?
a little bit .
we have this type of book at home .
but he didn't seem to be all that interested in it .
what he recently he has decided that he likes books .
but only to be excited about the book .
and bringing it to you to read .
but then he doesn't have the attention span to actually sit there and read it .
okay .
but he has some favorite books .
we have .
big box of books .
and i'll say ".
go get me olivia .
and he'll go and pick out the book .
like so he knows .
his favorite is the pokey little puppy .
which i understand why he doesn't want to sit through it .
it's very long .
but he loves it .
and he will get it every time .
like on many occasions .
that's his favorite it's clear that's his favorite .
but we have no idea why .
because he never reads it .
well you guys are a little bit mysterious ?
you young guys .
we don't know exactly what's going on .
we don't really get any .
clearer as they get older .
so what did you think so thought that this kind of stuff was his favorite today ?
i think so .
i think that that seemed .
to be a preference .
and you liked the bottle and spaghetti .
yup .
and those were the two main ones that he liked this time ?
and this bee thing .
the bee .
i mean obvi this is more his usual mode of play .
where he gets up .
and he tries to get in things .
and he's running around .
and he's kind of crazy .
quiet playing was kind of interesting to me .
even because he doesn't usually do that haha .
getting around like that .
right .
you said something about this one .
he has at my mom's house he has a white there's a white stuffed poodle .
that we named nellie because that was our white .
poodle's name when .
we had one .
and he loves nellie .
and he will as soon as he gets there go and get her and then pick her up .
and so this is a pink nellie .
and so this one .
that's what you were saying pink nellie .
you see the pink nellie ?
not interested .
that's not anything like nellie ?
this one maybe more like nellie ?
what does a chicken say ?
he's doing it .
so so do you think he prefers books or toys ?
i've i think probably .
toys .
although he looks at books as toys .
like it's all part of the same .
thing .
there's not a clear delineation that this is a .
book .
and this is what you do with a book .
he'll take the book .
and he'll .
does he get them out by himself ?
and l and does he turn pages ?
or is he sort of unloading more ?
i would say unloading .
and then he really wants .
to share it .
and th that seems to .
so and when you turn the pages he does try to turn .
the pages .
but we only use the board books .
because if there it's a real book he will rip the pages out so .
and we've decided that we don't .
want him to continue to do that .
so we took away all those books .
so it's a little bit harder even for his .
he's got pretty good coordination .
to turn the pages of the book .
he's pretty active ?
and you don't really have dolls at home .
and you have a few stuffed animals .
he has a few .
he liked .
the keys .
he likes to make noise .
so the he plays in the kitchen with me while i'm making dinner and stuff .
so he likes the .
teaspoons .
in fact i think i have one in my purse .
the measuring spoons and the .
i put them in the purple pitcher because he likes to .
make noise .
so we have a lot of things that have something else in it that shake .
he likes that a lot .
okay i remember now you did that .
why are you sitting like that ?
move your foot .
thank you .
no sitting ?
i mean .
is .
my mother in-law taught school in thailand .
and she said all the kids .
did that .
and it's just so terrible for their hip development and .
their knees so .
and i didn't even .
know it .
i mean i was like he's so flexible .
i figured he can do whatever .
but she was like he shouldn't do that .
they tend to do it to get some trunk support .
exactly .
and with that big belly you need some extra help don't you ?
let's see .
was there anything that you noticed ?
or that you have noticed since the last visit that has changed or that you think is interesting ?
well i mean he has gotten a lot more excited .
than you said .
can you fit that whole thing in your mouth ?
or you going to come you going to come get it ?
give it to me ?
be careful that's kind of pokey .
if you fall down it might hurt you .
i i think that he .
again it's hard to i mean if i saw what he did last time i could probably s say what more of his changes were .
but at home i i guess he d he has gotten a lot more deliberate in his play .
and more interactive .
so you know that he will bring more things to you .
or you know if i if i do build things he will kind of take them down .
he hasn't gotten to the point where he puts them away .
we tried to teach him the putting away game .
but he i think he's on to us already .
he's too smart ?
he's too smart .
about the cleaning up .
it was interesting the way he took that tower down one by one .
that's new actually .
he used to just kno .
we call him joezilla .
he'd just .
knock everything over .
but he has again gotten a little bit more deliberate with things so .
interesting .
and i had a .
i'm surprised he could do it .
he's pretty he's got a lot of mo mo fine motor coordination .
which means that he's eating lint and other small things that he can find on the floor .
old peas .
i'm like i really gotta be a better house cleaner now .
so i forgot .
so so that's kind of a change too .
and that he he's really gotten into the chasing games .
like i will just chase him around the house .
and then he'll chase me .
so that's kind of a .
new thing .
and we have balls .
he loves balls .
so we have a football .
and we have a baseball .
and which is just the ball at our house .
and then we have a new ball that's for outside play .
and at my mom's house he has two balls .
and he loves them .
loves them .
and he he's he picks them up .
and he does this thing with his hands i guess that my husband and i did that a lot .
like you know how you hit the ball before you throw the football kind of thing ?
so he does that and then .
those are not for you okay ?
let's leave those here .
let's leave them in here .
and then he is k starting to get into kicking .
but he loves he loves .
and there's a like one of those plastic balls that you get at giant .
that's great !
sweetie don't break it !
we needta throw that away .
not a good toy for this .
but he w i bought one .
and we took it outside yesterday .
and h it's in his stroller .
and he keeps trying to get it out .
he can't get it out .
it's too big .
it's .
in there .
but he's like i want this !
really attracted to balls .
alright well would've been interesting if we had one here .
my guess is that that would've been .
a favorite .
i mean i'm .
she's on to you .
she's knows !
which toys do you think asher was interested in ?
definitely interested in the food .
he's been that way .
all three times .
and he also likes the baby .
and the bottle anything plastic that he can chew on .
so would you say that his interests really haven't changed since the last time of which toys that he's gone to ?
was there anything that was new or that he didn't go to .
he .
his interests have pretty much stayed the same .
he's more interested in the baby and feeding the baby than he was last time .
so .
that was new .
but for the most part he paid some attention to the books and a lot of attention to the food and .
would this are these the type of things that he has at home ?
he does not not have any plastic food at home .
he does have some stuffed animals he does not have a babydoll .
lots of foods so .
some of each i guess .
i mean he has he doesn't have food but he has lots of plastic things that he likes to stick in his mouth so .
similar .
now the books was it mostly just you picking up a book or do any of them he wanted to go to ?
it was mostly just me .
which is interesting at home he loves books and here he's not as interested he doesn't really .
he didn't really go to any of them .
but like the touch and feel one he .
played with for a little bit and felt the appropriate .
do you have books like that at home ?
little circle .
yes .
he does .
yup .
so .
hi !
you mentioned he has a lot of books at home is that mostly what he plays with or you also like what would be his most the thing that he plays with the most at home ?
what he plays with at home is everything he's not supposed to he's more interested in mommy and daddy's stuff than he is in his own stuff but .
with his toys he has like .
he has some plastic nesting cups you know that kind of fit inside each other and stack up and he really likes those .
sorry .
boo !
and he .
but he likes his books a lot at home he plays with .
he has a few like a stacker toy .
but he likes that although mainly the pulling it apart but .
so you mentioned he liked the food a lot but he doesn't have those types of things at home but do you think that he recognized any of them as the food like does he eat any of those .
we have we do waffles and peas and he eats those i think he might recognize those .
the pizza i think he mainly likes the fun shape to it .
but .
because he's never really eaten pizza before he's seen it .
but he hasn't eaten a whole lot of it so .
i think he does actually recognize it as food .
i don't think he did the first couple of times .
but now i think he does make more of an association .
is that locked ?
so he can't get that open .
i think so .
okay .
now you when you were playing with him you said a lot of the names out loud do you think he recognizes these * m s names like the things you were saying do you think he .
i think he does .
i think most of them .
knows starting to recognize the world .
most of them .
rattle .
it don't work !
good thing it was towards the end .
what do you think .
she seemed to like the most ?
she liked shaking the keys .
and .
i think she liked the pasta too .
or the food i guess .
is that different from last time ?
yes .
cause last time i feel like she spent i mean she spent time with the baby this time but this time or .
this time i felt like she spent more time with the food and and the keys than the the baby .
what do you think how did she play with the baby this time ?
she still sort of exploring exploring it .
i i feel like .
looking at the eyes but just sort of .
and she kissed it but .
yup and there she goes .
is she looking at particular like body parts or do you talk about particular body parts ?
we do .
and it's funny because we have friends that have babies .
and when we get together with them she's very into looking at their different parts you know just checking them all out and everything like that .
so .
does she know is our our like eyes nose mouth familiar to her ?
familiar terms .
i think so .
we do a little little thing where its she knows like fingers and nose and toes i think because we do like kissy kissy finger kissy kissy nose .
okay .
so .
right ?
how about the food at this point ?
are there new foods that are more familiar to her ?
well she definitely i mean she eats waffles .
and she eats bread .
and she eats carrots .
and then .
my mom at her house and we go over to her house quite often has clay pizza and clay spaghetti .
she eats some spaghetti sometimes .
mash it up .
right do we mash up spaghetti ?
so it doesn't exactly look like that but you know it .
right ?
a little bit ?
i guess ?
she eats it plain ?
yes yes for the most part .
sometimes we'll add in like we'll mash it up cause she doesn't necessarily have she only has two teeth so .
we'll mash it up and then we put in some vegetable or something with it so .
you'll eat it .
so not necessarily tomato but something else so carrot sauce or something on top .
right ?
you like your farm animals .
do you think do you have play food at home ?
we do have some play food at home .
most of the play food that we have at home is we have well we have pots and pans .
so they pretend like her older brother will pretend to make something and say here you go ella this is whatever .
but then a lot of it is just plain like cans plastic cans and stuff like that so we haven't gotten we don't have this detailed stuff .
so .
thank you .
and so she usually plays with her brother with those things ?
yup yes .
do you guys cook in the kitchen ?
do you like to cook in the kitchen ?
you want me * put you down ?
okay .
you can play with the baby doll you can play with all these toys just not the wire .
okay ?
look !
it was very .
what was the toy that was least interesting to her ?
what did you think was least interesting ?
what did you find least interesting ?
no ?
did she play .
maybe the book .
what what i'm sorry .
no i was going to say the book .
but no go ahead .
but i do not know well but she i mean she was interested i felt like she was into it .
she's trying to do some of the like mimic some of the sounds .
cause her brother they have a fisherprice the farm .
and so he'll take some of the animals and he'll be like a cow says ella !
and she'll be like and she'll i mean sometimes she'll say it sometimes she won't but .
so she's like familiar with the animals sounds ?
yes yes .
which animal sounds are .
she'll do .
but he does i mean like he also i mean he is a boy so he'll be like so it's .
she like imitates the !
but she does and .
and sometimes i think she tries to do cluck .
can't quite get it yet .
what that's a !
that's a !
that's funny .
sometimes we try .
cause we also have a horse we both ride .
do you have is this the only book that you read here today ?
yes .
do you have books like that at home ?
where you can like touch and feel .
and we actually have put me in well we have put me in the zoo .
but the full size one so she doesn't really get into it .
i mean she gets into it but .
because they have the regular pages we try to just do the board books cause she's not quite gentle enough with the ones that have the regular pages so .
right ?
so we just do that at nap time .
you're funny .
what about the stuffed animals ?
she was into the winnie the pooh and punxsutawney phil .
i felt like but then the rest of them she didn't really get into i guess this time .
are there any animal names or that she's .
maybe she's .
i'm trying to think .
she knows .
she might know what a frog like a frog she would * might know .
she knows again farm animals .
i guess she would've known the chicken except for most the chickens we have a brown chickens are just around the house just for i do not know for whatever reason we have !
i mean we don't have real chicken but you know like the different pieces you know or different little play things are brown chickens .
so .
i do not know if she would .
and then again farm animals .
we have a lot of farm animals .
and we have like giraffes giraffes and elephants and stuff .
we don't have a zebra at home .
so .
i guess a lot of them she wouldn't necessarily she might know a dog .
but she doesn't really like real dogs so .
okay .
so i don't know if that i don't .
she knows what that looks like at least .
yes yes !
do you think have there ever have there been any changes since the last visit in terms of how she plays with toys ?
sorry !
can you hand that back to mommy please ?
no !
yes !
yes .
gotcha !
there !
she'll watch her brother do stuff and then she'll sort of do that .
and the other thing is that at home i mean we have a doll and stuff but most of the things we have are like cars and trucks and stuff just because .
that's what our brother liked .
and so we have .
so she she'll play with those and she'll like vroom the car and stuff like that .
okay .
so .
so more like .
is she is she still banging and playing that way ?
yes she yes she'll she'll bang things together .
we have a play piano .
but you know just like a little kids one it has like the four things .
and she'll bang on that and play the music .
the foot book !
we have that character at home !
and is she using utensils to eat ?
she tries to grab the spoon .
when we're feeding her but she can't quite get it to her .
her mouth yet .
so .
it's very messy so .
so we try .
experimental .
experimental right ?
very experimental .
right ?
but then you'll .
she does we'll do .
things like i'll cut up bananas and stuff and she'll take it with her hand .
but she can't quite .
get it .
in the spoon yet .
what are you doing ?
she fell so gentle at first .
she's a little dramatic too .
yes she loves keys .
real keys ?
she'll real keys .
she'll shake my keys .
and she'll play with those .
she likes to do that .
you're just .
you see the chicken ?
that what a chicken says ?
think you're getting teeth .
that would be nice .
and does she usually play with toys like this ?
this kinda like this all round and .
yes .
we have like something like that where you have the the different buckets .
so each of the buckets have sort of a different thing in it .
and my ideal is to have william her brother take one out and then play with that and then put it back .
but that doesn't necessarily always happen !
you know we we try but .
so a lot of times there are different toys spread out that she will go and and figure out .
and play with .
where * you going ?
she has a hammer she likes to hammer too .
this way ella bee !
does she ?
do you like to hammer ?
measuring spoon !
you help us measure ?
no !
yes !
no's her favorite ?
well unfortunately i think recently we've heard that a lot !
right ?
cause we like to go up stairs .
we like to find cords .
we like to find and play with things we're not supposed to play with .
those are the things that interest us .
and .
yes her brother will say that a lot too and be like !
that's funny no and .
no .
is there anything else that you noticed that was different about this session that she played with or didn't play with ?
i was very surprised she didn't play with the baby's shoes .
because at home she will work very hard to find everyone's shoes .
and play with the shoes .
and i mean she tries to chew on them too but like just play with them and everything .
yesterday she just got a pair of shoes from when we're * outside and she was obsessed with those too .
i was very i was surprised that she didn't on the baby doll .
now she doesn't have a baby doll that has shoes .
all of her baby dolls are pretty much soft baby dolls .
so they have like the shoes already on you know on them or whatever they don't come off so i don't know but i was i was kinda surprised .
cause she does like shoes .
cause she might've she didn't know if she even knew that they came off type of thing .
right, .
or i mean i was just .
are you chewing on the .
the dog ?
that's a dog .
let us not chew on his nose !
nah !
he might not like to have his nose chewed on .
can he give you kisses though ?
let us give the dog kisses !
she's like wait that's a dog ?
i know get him away from me no .
that's peanut butter !
i'm trying to think .
what else .
was different .
this way .
come this way .
i love you .
sorry !
it's okay .
alright .
where you going ?
you're supposed to be over here with the toys !
with the toys !
i'll get this .
you can pull yourself up on anything ?
you don't know yes .
are you all done ?
all done ?
all done !
good job !
look at you !
you're like i'm all done !
glad you just noticed them right now !
great timing !
yes !
okay well we'll just end it with it on that note .
okay okay .
sorry .
basically this is the last .
okay .
i guess i'll do the questions now .
i think he's just .
making a break for it .
okay .
okay so we just have a few questions .
okay .
i don't i wasn't with you the fir the previous two times bes so i don't know which toys was he most interested in .
still the food .
likes the food toys .
were there any food items in particular ?
not so much .
i mean he he usually because he consistently seems to go for the peas .
i don't know if it's the color of the texture .
but that's consistent .
the spoons he spent the most time with .
i think that he se he likes the rattling noise ?
last time ?
no this is the first time he's really been .
and he's you know seems specifically drawn to them .
he's always kind of gone to this one because he's got one of these at home .
okay .
or one like this at home .
he'll reach for the books but then he loses interest in the books .
okay .
and that's pretty consistent .
this is probably the most he's tried to eat all the toys .
all of the toys but it's .
we're talking about you .
the the bear the spoons and the food seem to be .
okay .
and what about the items that he seemed the least interested in ?
he didn't seem to much go for too many of the stuffed guys .
well the other stuff guys .
i mean i i don't know if he remembered him or or what the deal the the yellow .
and black striped .
completely no interest in like the bottles .
or the .
clock .
or .
or any of those .
but .
was that the same last time ?
i think he associates reading with bedtime .
okay .
because i read to him at night and then i put him down .
and then if he's if we try to read during the day he's like no .
no .
i know what you're doing .
so he doesn't seem to be a fan .
he's a little bit more subtle to ua he's a little bit more receptive about it at night .
okay .
so .
what about the stuffed animals since the last time ?
stuffed animals n the nothing specifically .
keep hitting your head !
nothing but the pooh the pooh bear .
okay .
do you think he recognizes names for any of these items ?
i usually call them your friend .
you know do you want to bring your friend with you your friend .
and so if he if he's holding them so i don't know if he knows that pooh is pooh and .
you know i don't think he can differentiate between th i just call them .
this is your friend you know .
right .
so i i give it sort of a generic name .
what about the food items .
do you think he's starting to recognize some of the food ?
it's possible .
his peas don't look this .
so i find it interesting that he's very .
fascinated by them .
so and and i don't i've never given him waffles i've given him bread .
an but it his bread doesn't even look like this .
so i mean you know by the time he gets it it's the chopped up into little pieces so .
i don't think so i i'm thinking it's either the color or the texture he's .
attracted to .
okay .
so and of course the he's never in he's never in life had one of these .
he was kind of into the shake .
okay .
and do you have any of these toys or similar ones at home ?
no just the pooh .
okay .
what about the books .
you said that you read to him at night ?
do you have any of these .
we only have good night moon .
okay .
that's the only one that .
that we have .
okay .
and good night moon he he usually i think it's just because it's long .
he usually gets he's like alright are we asleep yet ?
do you play with pretend food at home ?
no .
you have to so if you had if you were asked if he prefers books over toys or toys over books .
i'd say toys over books .
okay i think .
and the animals you're saying he doesn't .
some kids are really fascinated by animals very early on .
we have two dogs at home so i think you know .
the stuffed ones are .
you know he's like i got a live one .
that's okay .
sounds good well i think that's all we have for now .
you did really good !
now well you get to pick a toy to take home before i forget .
want to pick your own toy ?
want to pick your own toy ?
i want to heart .
probably take that microphone off .
sorry .
you okay ?
i am so it's caught in my hair .
hi !
hi !
you're getting ready to walk ?
working on it ?
won't be long .
the theme for today is things i can put in my mouth and chew .
okay so i just want to ask you some questions about what you did .
i noticed you playing a lot with the food .
which items did he like ?
well he was eating the peas the both this main spaghetti .
spaghetti ?
there's one that has the meat sauce but he wasn't playing so much with that one .
and then the pizza .
and but the peas and the spaghetti seem to be his favorite .
and do you remember which of the dessert items you might have showed him ?
i showed him this but he didn't seem real interested in the dessert .
i showed him the icecream cone too .
and he didn't .
now he does .
but he didn't want it before .
becau that's pretty much what he .
how about this one joe ?
he did pick the cookie up .
he did find the cookie on his own and he did eat the cookie .
there you go with the .
you know how to make it go in your mouth .
but then he went for the clock and then .
but he did play with the baby for a little bit .
and he did pick up the the sippy cup .
which is weird because he doesn't drink out of one .
he doesn't drink out of them .
he he won't drink out of it .
he prefers a cup if he's .
does he not like sugary things ?
no .
he he gets one bottle of juice a day but he he drinks mostly out of a bottle or a cup now he he just won't drink out of a sippy .
he'll chew the tip of the sippy cup but he won't eat drink out of it .
and then they all fell out and they gotta go in again .
that's right .
but he played with the baby for a little bit gave the baby a hug .
so but but i i showed him the sheep and the frog and the i didn't get to the the pooh bear and the this one and he wasn't interested in the stuffed animals today .
do you remember what you told him that was i know some people get confused .
with this ?
the otter .
i think some people get confused about it .
yep nope i called it i said otter and he just kinda looked at like whatever .
and the frog you're like whatever .
he's like i got my food and things i can stick in my mouth and bite stuff .
does he know about utensils and things like that ?
he does .
and i handed him a spoon and he i think he that's right what did he .
where did i put it ?
here it is .
he went like that which is what he usually does .
he he uses the wrong end usually .
but he didn't put it in his mouth .
do you remember if there are other foods you showed him ?
that he might recognize from home ?
i he ate the he was trying to eat the toast .
but i made a sandwich and he was would take the piece of toast .
is what he would take .
each time .
and every time i put something on the plate he would take it right off which is what he does at home so .
you dump everything ?
dump everything onto your tray so you can pick it apart .
does he know which foods are for breakfast and which for foods are for ?
i don't think so .
no ?
they're all the same to you ?
he's just like stuff to eat but he really likes the peas .
how about this one you like this one ?
because i showed him .
you chew on this one ?
i showed him that and was like that's what your brothers eat for breakfast but he didn't seem to really didn't seem to really care at the time .
but now it's just let's put everything in our mouth and chew .
what what all else did he put in his mouth ?
that was pretty .
that was pretty much it .
he played a little bit with the keys but not very much .
i guess it doesn't have the same clanging sound as as car keys so .
the real ones .
mommy's keys they make a cool sound .
but every time i put the pizza all six slices back into a pie he would take at least two of them out so .
but he didn't seem to really .
he's really really into the peas and the spaghetti .
you wait three years from now you won't want to touch those .
it's like which is weird because he went .
thank you .
he ate before we came .
and he had a lot of food too .
thank you .
thank you .
he's like what you doing ?
is that a piece of paper ?
can i play with it ?
yes .
do you remember if you showed him any other animals ?
no it was it was pooh bear and these .
i tried to show him the bee .
but he was .
you weren't having that were you ?
no he did not want to look at the bee and the sheep .
go open some foods .
he goes the wires .
it's the other fun thing to play with at home ?
yes .
well i think that about does it joseph .
you were really good today .
yep .
baby has shoes .
yep that's what you do with your shoes too ?
do you eat your shoes too ?
yes he does .
okay .
okay .
i think we'll have him stop .
just ask .
you get to keep playing .
hi !
i don't know if you can remember this is your .
second ?
third .
third .
third already .
which of .
which of these toys did he seem interested in .
this time ?
he likes the .
the spoons .
the measuring spoons and the cup .
and the .
the bottle over there .
he .
he seems more interested in these two now .
then before .
this soft .
stuffed animals .
that's a chicken .
why do you think that these ?
interest him ?
i think .
the cup .
and the spoon .
and the bottle .
cause he's drinking on his own now .
so maybe .
just the fact that he can do it on his own and .
he does it .
and he's teething .
he likes to put stuff in his mouth .
too .
what about .
which group do you think he's least ?
interested in ?
maybe the books .
he didn't really touch them .
i hadta like bring one over to him .
and .
so the books .
do you guys read ?
books at home ?
we try to at least .
at least once a day .
but at home he's always like .
playing with them even if i don't read it to him .
right .
he always has a book and he's flipping through it .
okay .
so maybe .
the other toys are new .
so ha .
okay .
so would you say he's still ?
into toys more ?
or ?
books ?
into the toy ?
into ?
does he ?
does he like ?
prefer books or the toys ?
toys .
toys ?
do you ?
do you think he recognizes any of the animals ?
or the names of ?
maybe ?
does he know ?
maybe dog .
he says dog a lot .
and we have a dog .
and .
whenever we have a .
whenever the dog barks he says .
dog .
okay .
not exactly dog .
but you know .
as much as he can .
but .
i think that's his main .
animal right now ha dog ha .
what about the foods ?
the food ?
recognize any ?
not really .
i don't think so .
okay .
maybe just the drinks inside the cup .
i mean .
that .
he knows what it's for that there's .
something inside .
to drink .
but we don't like eat ice cream on a cone .
i guess usually in a cup so .
and the cheese i usually like .
tear it up for him .
so it doesn't look like this to him .
the same with like the bread .
right .
so .
he he doesn't see these .
the this food in this whole form .
it's usually like chopped or .
pureed so .
okay .
thank you this is pizza .
pizza .
what about dolls ?
i guess .
how many dolls or i guess he wouldn't have haha .
his sister does so .
he plays with dolls at home .
okay .
so he he knows what dolls are .
alright .
what is this ?
that may be a beaver .
pretend food at home ?
yes .
you do okay .
okay i think that's it .
unless is there anything else ?
you want to add or talk about ?
about the way he plays at home ?
not really no .
okay .
nothing i can think of .
this is a kangaroo .
haha you want to kiss him ?
thank you .
okay yup .
let's go get your sister .
did you notice anything different from this time what she plays with this time from last time ?
she played with no i don't think she really played with much .
kinda wandered around and did her thing .
please don't rip that off .
last time were there some things that .
what was her favorite thing .
last time you were here ?
she always goes to the food i mean like the sippycup .
she took the sippycup, she took the cookie and she took the bottle and tried to eat and drink out of them .
and i think that's been pretty consistent with her .
last time she played a little bit with the stuffed animals this time she kind of threw went through them and then threw them to the side .
do you think there were any stuffed animals that she played with that she recognized the names of ?
i don't think so yet .
or if she does nothing that i i noticed .
okay so everything was kind of like new new names or ?
i mean she you know like the she picked up the fox and i don't know if the fox looks a little like her cat .
okay .
but that was when she was going through .
that's who she went to grab .
yes thank you .
so like familiar face colors .
what about the you said the food do you think she knows the names of some of the food ?
i think the cookies and the bottle and the sippycup and the juice .
okay these are more familiar to her .
did you guys play with books this time ?
i tried she played a little bit and she looked through it but not not as much i mean .
usually at home she'll grab a book and walk around and sounds like she's trying to read it but .
she didn't really play too much with the books .
she i have no idea if she likes the colors of this or what but this she grabbed .
do you think she knows the name ?
of the clock ?
probably not .
okay .
it could be color .
she'd no interest in the baby .
did you try to play with the baby ?
i tried i tried to get her to feed the baby and .
no interest in the baby .
do you have baby dolls at home ?
she does have a two some she'll walk around with them .
she just carries them is there is she is that how she plays with them ?
she'll just carry them right now .
she you know sometimes looks like she's going to give the baby a kiss or a hug but .
i don't know if she really is or .
amira .
she doesn't the only things she says is she says daddy and then she calls cat jazzy .
and then otherwise it's nonsense words .
okay great .
there's nothing in there for you to drink .
i thought there were some words that you were working on ?
trying you know like i'll when she gives me something i'll say thank you and she'll mumble but she doesn't say thank you back she'll just mumble .
like you know like a two second something back so just trying to get her .
to at least be familiar with the stuff with the words .
but no she's not much of a no actual formed words really .
it's still pretty much baby .
hold on .
so you said the animals that names weren't familiar was the fox was just it was like just the look .
i wonder if it was just the look .
i'm not sure she knows .
do you play games like patty cake or ?
she plays patty cake and will play like i'll chase her or she'll you know like i'll hide and we'll creep up on each other .
okay do you say boo or peekaboo or ?
i'll do you know like i'll come up and say boo or just to scare you know like she knows i'm coming and she'll jump like she's scared .
even though she sees me running towards her .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
you can't drink out of that though baby .
what kind of books at home do do you have ?
she has she has the hard cover of these little books and what she really likes that i've been buying her are popup books .
so i have a bunch that are just you know in the jungle in the ocean .
she'll sit and go through the popup books .
okay .
so i thought i could get her to do this one because it's you know kind of interactive .
but .
not really .
she wasn't .
super interested .
no but her popup books she loves .
has she been eating food ?
like like solid food ?
any of the ones that were here ?
she'll eat like the greens i mean she picked up the peas .
she eats a lot of green veggies .
and then like pancakes and she picked up the waffle like she'll do pancakes and crackers and you know any type of bread stuff like that .
okay and is she familiar with winnie the pooh ?
i'm not sure no i don't think so not yet .
she doesn't watch you know like i don't she doesn't watch winnie the pooh or anything like that .
no winnie the pooh yet .
right ?
was there anything in here what was her least favorite thing ?
here today ?
i'm going to have to say the doll .
how much time do you think do you spend playing with the doll ?
she wouldn't like i said she wouldn't even play with it i picked it up and tried to get her interact and she had no interest .
and then her favorite thing ?
she would i'm going to say the sippycup .
she walked around with that and the little clock not that she knew how to play with it .
she walked around .
but the sippycup she kept trying to drink out of .
do you think what are like the characteristics of toys that she really likes at home ?
she has now she's getting into the stage where she you know like has like .
the little animal doll characters then they have their vehicles and a train and she'll sit and she'll actually drive you know like start to push them around and drive them then the ball that she plays with .
that she'll throw around or kick .
okay so more active toys ?
i don't see her do any roleplaying yet .
but she's all i mean she's back and forth all over with toys .
the animal the animal farm toys you bought that just before your second visit ?
right ?
i've had i've been collecting them for a while .
okay .
and before i mean she before she wouldn't really do anything with them like she would grab you know walk around with them if she'd want them but now i noticed she's started to put them in the little vehicles and push the vehicles around .
that's cool .
so .
starting to get there .
so things that are more immobile do you think she's attracted to things for color or touch or like texture ?
or sound like what ?
she really likes the sound she likes music she dances she has some toys like that will play music and she'll play with those .
she loves music and dance .
she'll stop what she's doing if you know a commercial comes on with a little jingle to go over to it and dance .
okay .
you can't eat that either baby .
well you know it looks like food .
you're funny .
you're funny .
well thank you so much for coming in today .
no problem .
can you put your shoes on ?
and working with us as far as with the schedule .
what interested her ?
well you know every time we come here .
she always grabs that bottle .
and .
so she remembers the bottle ?
but i th i think it's because it is a bottle .
you know ?
that she grabs gravitates towards that .
and then like all the food toys this time she was putting in her mouth .
like in th in the first thing she picked up when we came in was the peas .
and last time she was attracted to the peas as well .
this time i showed her to clap the the blocks .
to she sa saw that it made a sound .
you like that ?
so then she was doing it .
and then with the circular cylinder shaped blocks .
but then she picked up the pizza and she noticed there was more pizza over there so she went to go get all of them .
okay .
and then she started to shh tap the pizza together to see if she could make the sound with the pizza but .
you know it's like she picked it she saw it like made a beeline for it and then came back and then she looked and saw that there was more so .
all of the food stuff .
the waffle she put in her mouth .
the icecream i said because we ju we her sister just had an icecream cone .
okay .
and so maybe you know she recognized that .
but she i said icecream and she went to go put it in her mouth .
we took tried to take it the real icecream away from her and she had a fit .
so maybe she remembered that you know the icecream experience from the other day .
she still eating it .
this one is .
i joke and say it's her favorite toy because she hates this thing .
i mean like .
it is so funny the reaction she gives when like she thinks .
but then she was getting brave today .
she came and sat on me and she actually pulled it .
okay .
but then when i go to put it next to her she's she makes a fit .
she doesn't like it .
does she know what that's called ?
a bee .
i don't know if she knows a bee .
no i think what it is is this these things .
okay .
they look alive .
she doesn't like it .
we have a kooshball at home too that she does not like .
and her sister doesn't .
i play tricks on both of them and put it ne close to them .
they realize it's there and they take off running .
but she does not this thing right here is not her favorite .
clearly it's not her favorite .
okay .
and clearly she doesn't like .
because she even jumps if it she thinks its co going to her .
see ?
you see her face ?
she's like get that thing away from me .
she doesn't like it .
she likes that ?
the sp well she just picked the spoon up .
the whole time she didn't .
even the measuring spoons .
and then i use these too when cooking you know so .
so she she knows it ?
she probably it's like whatever they're just spoons .
but i just noticed this time .
she didn't last time i was trying to get her to clap the blocks and she didn't do it .
but this time i did it and she wanted to do it as well so she liked the blocks .
the baby and you know she plays with the babies .
we have several babies at home .
different ethnicity babies as well .
and she she just throws them about .
i mean you know it's no big no big love affair that she has with the babies .
but and then a plethora of stuffed animals so maybe the toys the stuffed animals she so too familiar with them she's like i can play with those at home i don't want to play with those .
i these food type blocks and toys and she does have a play bottle at home it's muc it's a little smaller than that one .
and she does the same thing .
she puts it straight to her mouth like she's going to feed herself .
and of course she sees this and automatically knows its a cup .
okay .
and she we i'm trying to stop her from breastfeeding now .
but she's been more taken more to the bottle and to cups .
and and she wants to drink out of what you have .
so maybe this is because even though it's smaller and it's clearly a toy .
maybe it's because it's familiar with her at home of drinking out of the maybe she's familiar with it you know from home from drinking out of it at home .
was there anything else that she liked to play with ?
it looked like she preferred the toys over the books .
she de i tried to read her we tried to get her like to look at the books even the peekaboo book which the last time she at least i could get her to look and and then for a quick you know couple of seconds .
but this time she didn't even want to look at it .
she wasn't wasn't even bothered .
but it looked like she was going to turn the page help me turn the pages of this book here .
but then she got bored really quickly .
and it's it's crazy because we read books everyday at home .
and not little books but like big picture books and you know .
and things like that .
she enjoys sitting .
and i don't know maybe it's because of her sister .
she has we have a three year old at home .
so and micah is definitely trying to learn how to read .
but and quinn because she just is trying to emulate her sister .
maybe it's why .
but here by herself i don't want to read any books i want to play with the toys .
what ?
are you finished ?
are you done ?
you want to play with the microphone ?
that's not a toy though .
i don't think i have any more questions for you .
okay .
i think you're all done .
alright .
alright .
ready to go ?
ready to go ?
alright .
and the keys i didn't mention .
she wouldn't put the bottle down for the longest until i gave her the keys .
and then she dropped the bottle to play with the keys .
but she loves keys .
you love keys ?
okay .
you'll be driving soon .
no you can wait for that .
thank you for coming in today .
thank you .
good luck with your studies .
alright .
okay over there ?
he's fine .
be careful mister !
he's .
were there which group of toys did he seem to like ?
the food .
the food ?
okay .
what about the least ?
the stuffed animals .
okay .
and i don't know if you remember .
but do you think that changed ?
the last time he also liked the toys .
and i .
or the food .
and i think it hasta do with the fact that it's the most the easiest for him to chew on because he's teething like he was last time .
so the last time he chose the pea .
like i just think the shape of them .
it's easy for him to hold and to gnaw on .
because i know he doesn't know what spaghetti .
i mean i'm pretty sure he doesn't know what spaghetti is .
he's never had spaghetti so .
okay .
did he did he go to the books at all ?
he didn't .
i mean i tried to read them to him .
i think .
at home he tends to we read a lot .
i've been surprised that when we're here he's not interested in the books .
but it might just be because there's other .
toys here that he's not familiar with .
do you guys have any of these at home ?
we have .
we have the put me in the zoo .
and we have no we don't have we have the regular good night moon .
not good night moon one two three .
this book .
grammy h grandma has .
at her house .
so .
does he have similar toys at home ?
he h i mean he has books .
he has stuffed animals .
he doesn't have any food toys .
okay .
no .
okay .
although the one thing i was surprised by was that he picked this up and tried to drink outta it .
because we're we're transitioning him to a .
bottle at night before bed .
and so he it took him a long time to get adjusted to that .
but now he obviously knows what it is because he was trying to get the liquid out haha !
okay haha .
so you said he l .
what do you doing ?
toys or books that he likes .
at home i would say he'd prefers his toys .
i mean we generally use books kind of as a wind-down thing before naptime or bedtime .
what do you doing with the peas ?
i think you said he doesn't know what spaghetti he never had spaghetti before .
no no .
would he recognize any of the other foods ?
i mean i'm not sure because when when he gets peas we give them like th we give him like three or four peas at a time .
and that's not really what this looks like .
so i'm not k completely sure .
he eats cheese all the time .
but again .
we give it to him in little tiny pieces .
so i'm not sure that he would associate this with a piece of cheese .
obviously he did know what the s .
well i think he knew what the spoon was .
although he tried to brush his hair with it .
you know it seemed like he knew that the spoon went in his mouth .
but for the most part all of the food he gets at this point is .
still cut up into little .
waffles too .
i mean i've given him waffles before .
but it comes out of the toaster .
and i cut it up .
and then i give him three pieces at a time .
so i don't know that he knows that this is what he's eating .
okay right haha .
would he recognize any of the animals ?
do you think ?
i mean he knows dogs .
but i'm not sure that .
he knew that this was a dog .
i'm not sure i would know that's a dog .
kinda like a cat .
so that would probably be the one .
he's really into mice these days .
but i don't think there's any mice here .
so no probably not .
okay .
i'm sorry !
did you lose the peas ?
okay i think that should be .
is there anything else the way he plays at home that you want to tell us ?
no i mean th his favorite thing these days and probably for the last month or two has been a ball .
and so i'm sure if there was a ball in the mix that's what he would've been obsessed with the whole time .
okay i think that's it then .
alright .
what do you doing buddy ?
is it okay if i ask you some questions ?
so tell me about what you guys played with .
he was really interested in the food .
he was he likes he's still teething so it's everything in his mouth chewing on everything .
he doesn't eat a lot of solids yet still so like he doesn't know like this is pizza that's icecream or anything yet .
but .
but he definitely is interested in self feeding with a spoon so he was into the spoons and tried to you know imitate feeding himself and with the bottle and the sippycup .
so he was into those .
he's not he's still not really into the stuffed animals because they don't do anything for him .
and then the baby he was into a little bit .
and the peekaboo book .
who's got you ?
see if you can play with that .
that's really fun .
they're magnets just like on the fridge .
he's like no .
so still i think last time i said he likes things that make noise he's still into anything that makes or he can teethe on .
and his new skill seems to be throwing things so he threw a few things .
and i was trying since i mean he doesn't really know like frozen peas or tacos or anything so i was using these as blocks to knock them to build a tower for him to knock down because he likes to do that at home with his we have like solo cups that we stack up and nest and everything and he likes that .
that's the baby's face .
you going to get her ?
be gentle .
were there any foods in particular you were or i think i noticed he was playing actually with the bottle a lot .
he was playing with the bottle .
he occasionally takes a bottle at home and a sippycup at home too .
so that was kind of .
there's the teething .
so i think he was like bottle you know sippycup .
i know those things .
what does he usually get in them ?
in the bottle it's breast milk and the sippycup is water .
so he is not familiar with juice he hasn't had juice .
the reason why he's been slow on solids is because we think he has food allergies so .
okay .
that's why he's like not so familiar with all that stuff .
okay .
were there any like food names that maybe you say at home or you're trying to teach him or ?
he probably is familiar with the word ice the words icecream .
not because my mother in-law says daddy come home bring john an icecream cone kinda like a rhyme .
but he wouldn't associate that well with icecream cone necessarily i don't think .
because dairy is one of the things that we think he has a sensitivity to so .
okay .
apple he may recognize apples because there was apple juice .
he gets apple sauce at home .
but everything else he really we haven't really worked on like food words because he's not really getting a lot of food .
but the peas .
he really i think he really liked their texture .
you're just cracking yourself up over there !
i think he liked the texture .
he's had pee puree before but he wouldn't necessarily look at this and say that's peas you know ?
because it's been a puree .
and then what about the .
i can get it .
okay .
the baby .
how did you guys play with the baby ?
he's really interested in shoes and socks lately .
so i tried to .
and i always point out babies when we seem them .
so i tried to get him interested on the in the shoe and the baby .
okay .
is the baby having an icecream cone ?
hi there .
so you talk about like body parts and clothing ?
we .
we try to i'm teach trying to teach him like nose head hair that kinda thing .
shoe !
you like to show off shoes when you find them .
you really like shoes and socks .
do you think he knows that word ?
i think so .
because he's always going to them at home and showing them to me or pointing to them .
and typically when he's doing he's familiar with it .
you know what i mean like .
no .
good boy .
want to come here ?
come get the baby .
yes .
the baby wants to give you a hug .
what's that a pitcher ?
like his hats he loves hats and .
no .
come here .
come back here .
yes .
good boy .
what's that ?
pizza !
so things that he is trying to show me .
or you know calling my attention to i think are things that he's done in the past a lot .
and he's he knows okay this is something i've seen before you know .
it's a sock or a shoe .
okay .
and then you said body parts .
which ones do you think he's more fascinated with or you've been working on with him ?
nose .
he likes noses .
face .
and then feet and hands and fingers .
and tongue .
i didn't say any of those things i i don't remember saying that .
but you know those are the things .
he's going for it .
john .
your sock's coming off too !
come on let's go over here .
here we go .
were there any any of the books that you played with or ?
we played with the peekaboo book because that's his favorite game i mean he's always .
like sometimes he'll like if we're in my room at home we'll he'll crawl around the bed and kinda like lean .
like when whenever he does this motion i know he's like trying to do peekaboo whether it's whether something's in front of him or not .
he gets this look on his face .
so that's that's his favorite so i thought he might like that the you know hide and seek book .
of course it didn't hold his ten attention for very long when there were things to chew on .
but .
i think we have this book at home we haven't looked at it too much but .
maybe not .
baby animals is something that we have .
i thought maybe i'd show him something that we didn't have at at home .
how about the stuffed animals ?
i noticed does he recognize ?
he we have a larger version of that be winnie the pooh .
he doesn't play with it .
he really isn't very into stuffed animals .
special surprise .
special delivery !
he's not really into stuffed animals all that much .
so i kept like trying to find something that he'd be interested in .
like we have a dog at home so he's very familiar with the word dog and puppy and all that .
and so there was a little chihuahua here .
the chihuahua i was trying to show him to get him interested in but again it's it doesn't you know do anything interesting and he can't really bite it very well i don't think .
that's kind of .
and i think you played with the waffles too .
did you say ?
he doesn't know what they are .
but he i think he threw one or somthing i can't remember exactly what he did with it so .
hi !
you got me .
you got me .
yes .
and then you have a nick name for him .
coop .
our last name is cooper and so i call him coop sometimes .
and we're trying to i try to i actually probably call him coop more often than not but i intersperse john and coop .
where'd your sock go ?
that's not the baby's .
that's not for babies !
but you're interested in it .
interested in it .
his sock's all the way on the other side of the room .
okay well i think that's all the questions i have .
okay .
i hope that was useful .
it was !
let's put your sock on .
where does your sock go on your feet ?
what were some of the things that she liked to play with today ?
the doll .
say the doll and this kangaroo .
is it similar to things that she played with last time ?
no you didn't have the doll last time .
she was normally playing with the food last time .
or she normally picks up the food like this and things that she knows .
and the little creatures .
but she's really playing she played with the doll more or less today .
okay .
what kinds of things was she doing ?
is the doll new for her ?
the doll is new for her .
she was pointing to the eyes the nose the mouth .
being a little mean to her like michael is to her you know .
so i think she thought it was a baby .
you could tell she thought it was a little person .
no that's a .
you found your piggy .
good .
that's bologna .
bad piece of bologna but bologna .
and she's more active today than she was last time .
okay .
how so just ?
in terms of asking what things are .
you know she's like pointing to them what's this picking it up talking more .
i think last time she was rather quiet if i'm not mistaken .
i wasn't in with you last time i was .
i think she was a little more quieter .
just kinda sorta picking things up thinking that it was food .
why isn't this food ?
you know this is hard .
but she knew what they were .
say thank you .
what are some of the things that you think she did recognize this time just by .
well what's this ?
say say cookie .
mckayla eat your cookie .
like she knows .
wait where's the juice box ?
like she knows the cup you're supposed to drink out of it .
she'll try to drink out of it .
she thinks that's a cup .
so she's trying to suck it you know and it's not working properly .
this is peanut butter .
it's not even a cup .
she kinda sorta knows what you're supposed to do with the different things .
you want some food ?
there you go .
she tried to feed the bread to the baby .
but she didn't really play with too much more than that .
okay .
did she show any interest in any of the animals or where there any that you thought .
just the zebra .
okay .
she knows what a zebra is .
all the .
well she knows what some of the toys are like the dog .
she knows what the toy some of the toys but she doesn't .
she has a lot of stuffed animals at home .
sometimes she plays with them sometimes she don't .
she plays with more blocks and trucks and whatever her brother plays with .
computers and .
she never ventured that far out the circle .
i know i'm talking right ?
i took mommy's attention didn't i ?
she's like !
and those wires are looking mighty tempting .
what are you doing ?
what happened ?
i do not know .
why you breathing hard kayla ?
kayla .
say i don't know .
i do not know .
how about books did you guys ?
she'll read we read half of the foot book .
same that we read last time .
does she is so do you have that book at home ?
i don't have doctor seuss at home i have a lot of the other books .
like goodnight moon .
i have this one .
she normally goes and picks up a book that she wants read .
if she doesn't pick it up she she normally does pay attention but it's gotta be kinda interesting .
this one she was more .
i don't think she she wanted to kinda smash the book lately .
there you go .
there you go !
you did it all by yourself !
i don't want it .
that's a that's a .
that's a bird .
see ?
no it's not it's an eagle .
exactly it's an eagle .
here .
take him .
take him .
take him .
that's pizza .
pizza kayla .
see she knows what foods are .
say this don't taste like no pizza mommy that's nasty .
pizza .
just in reda regards to the foot book i'm sorry .
does she know the words that you're the word foot and the plural feet .
does she know those ?
she knows what feet are i do not know if she knows what a foot is .
but she knows what feet hands fingers .
she's telling you i'm going to do it anyway .
eyes mouth .
no don't eat that .
she knows .
we do clean the toys .
you do ?
because i'm not sure .
i'm like they're so dirty .
she knows quite a bit .
she knows bottle .
cup juice milk .
cookie .
you want a cookie kayla ?
how was she .
she knows dance .
how was she what ?
play with the play with the food .
how or how were you both playing it or how does she play with it at home ?
well when she we she doesn't play with the food at home .
that's the whole thing .
so to her if you see food you eat it .
she doesn't .
i would not do that to no child that's just wrong .
that's j that's wrong .
i just don't under .
whatever .
they have regular food i don't have food toys at home .
okay .
well because they eat she eats a variety so she's end up knowing what these different meats are .
just because they're normally in her plate .
that's probably why she picks them up .
they get pizza and bread and .
and you tell them what the real thing is when you get it so .
she's like i want to eat it .
you can't eat it no no .
nope that's just as fake as the other piece you picked up .
okay .
least favorite ?
see she .
say all this fake stuff mommy this is so rude .
it's fake kayla .
you gotta get this .
she know you're looking at her now .
i don't think she has a least favorite .
i do not know she's just exploring i don't know if she's not not liked anything .
give me that bottle .
is it good ?
say i don't taste anything .
it's juice .
so what is the purpose of this one ?
this study we're actually just trying to get so see the children's babble over time .
as their language are changing and how they're responding to the different toys .
so we use the same set of toys over and over again .
so we kind of compare amongst themselves like each child amongst themselves over time .
and see how they're developing and if their speech pattern kinda changes .
and then the next visit after this one the two year visit we actually do articulation and speech and language testing .
and we see if like that trend that development has anything to do the way this child developed and the next child developed and those types of things .
okay .
so we'll have over a hundred fifty kids at the termination of the project .
to see so a lot some of the kids have been coming back with like speech and language difficulties and see if there's anything early on based on the laboratory skills that we're doing in there as well as the babbling that we're seeing in here and the way that they're playing really interacting with the toys .
if there's something early on that we can see that points to a learning .
a learning disability .
right a learning disability .
okay that makes sense .
no with mckayla she's just she's much more active today than she was last time .
see last time she stayed within the circle .
it's a whole lot messier now than it was last time .
she kinda stayed exactly where you put her last time .
a lot of that .
okay .
you can have the stand .
okay .
so i think we're actually done .
okay .
at talking about what we played with today so i'm going to stop it .
because she's getting really interested in it .
as you can see she branched outside of the toys and went to the real stuff and that's what she does at home .
so i have the same round of questions .
okay .
that i have to read as last time .
one of the first things we like to ask is do you notice if you remember what she played with last time .
if you r did you notice any changes ?
i think shh i think she might have remembered some of these .
because i could just tell by her reactions .
it seemed like especially the bee .
but maybe she was a little more maybe because she was like a little f familiar with the area and the toys .
like she she was like going out and grabbing them on her own .
whereas before i was like handing them to her i think .
were there any specific ones that you found she played with now and not last time ?
last time ?
no i don't think so .
i remember last time she played with the animals and the food .
and that seemed to be what she was interested in this time also .
although actually she was the spoons and the keys .
i don't know if the spoons were here last time .
but the keys were here last time .
and she was having a lot more fun with these today .
how about books here and at home .
she's not she her attention span isn't really .
we have trouble getting through a full book with her .
okay .
so .
i could tell .
i think books were at the bottom of her list today .
there's just too much other stuff for her to look at .
i'm sorry do you have any of the books at home ?
these books ?
we do .
we do have some of these books .
but i don't know if she's ever .
i don't think we've gone over these books these particular ones with her .
with her sister we have .
but i don't think we don't have any of these exact ones .
that that we've gone over with her .
like her her books generally are like .
because these are a little bit more advanced .
i don't know her books the ones we do at have at home are like four pages long .
the inflatable or like the touching ?
we have an inflatable one that she likes .
but they're also cardboard .
just like real quick with you know like an animal on each page or something .
not where you have to word read multiple words .
she that's when she starts to lose her lose focus on the book .
do you think she'd recognize any of the names of the animals today ?
maybe .
she knows i i think she kind of knows dog .
because we have our dog .
and like the like woof woof .
she knows to associate with with the dog .
but i think she remembered the bee .
for sure .
but i don't know about like names of the animals .
maybe the bee .
probably more the sounds though that i make with him .
i was doing that with her last time .
she seemed to remember that .
and i noticed that a couple times rather than saying dog you used either the type of dog or a dog name .
the dog's name .
our dog's name tasmin .
so that's i've been going over like tasmin's a dog .
and he says woof woof .
so i was trying to get her to kind of although .
tasmin doesn't look like either of these dogs .
but my parents .
who she sees my parents .
a few times a week .
they have a poodle .
not a pink poodle but haha .
named frio .
so i was thinking maybe she'd get get that out of this .
but i don't know .
probably not .
so and the bear .
the bear .
she i don't know if she really knows who winnie the pooh is .
but she's we went to disneyworld in march .
and we saw lots of winnie the pooh there .
but i doubt if she remembers that .
do you have stuffed animals at home ?
lots of animals at home .
how do you usually play with them at home ?
same thing .
just like having like you know rubbing them against her and ticking her .
so shh she's a big fan of the stuffed animals and hugging them .
and the play food that seemed to be .
the play food she'll just want to eat .
she really likes to eat .
so anything that looks like cooking food she's going to test it out .
so i think she doesn't you know doesn't know the difference between pretend food and real food .
but pretty much the food we feed her at home is cut up into small pieces .
so i don't think she would make the association between .
what she's eaten and the play food .
that makes sense .
are is there anything that would be .
i know last time you said she loves everything .
is there a favorite food here ?
honestly she would eat any of this .
she does like noodles .
either noodles or cheese .
would probably be out of what's here would probably be her favorite .
although she'd quickly eat up anything else .
you said you didn't have play food at home ?
we do .
how do you play with that usually ?
well it's pretty much just in her sister's play kitchen .
she'll just go over to the kitchen and pull it out and chew on it .
and so we don't really .
we don't really play with her with the food .
she just kind of gets it out herself .
you use it to like feed the animals or ?
she does .
i don't know if she really understood that .
she does like to .
take whatever she's eating and put it to my mouth .
and she likes me to pretend that i'm eating her food .
well she thinks i'm eating it but .
okay isabelle off the chords .
your favorite thing here .
what is that ?
speaking of that what do you think was her favorite thing today ?
either the bee or the dogs .
those seemed to really entertain her for a while .
just had lots of hugs for the for the dogs .
i think she likes the texture of this .
it's like a different rubbery texture .
that's good .
do you think that gets her a lot ?
textures ?
defin the textures and also the colors .
i think this has some you know bright colors and contrast to it .
and the sounds ?
definitely sounds .
absolutely .
and i feel like she knew what to do with the spoon .
she was putting that right in her mouth .
although you know we'll give her we'll feed her .
but we'll give her a spoon to play with .
and she .
tries to pick up the food and with the spoon and put it in her mouth .
okay and do you think .
you said you think she recognized the bee but .
but do you think she would recognize the names .
as in if you said it out loud she would look at it or know what you're talking about ?
maybe the dogs .
isabelle .
i think maybe dogs she would she might do the association .
but i don't think anything else she would really .
i mean i guess shh she's heard the words before .
but i don't think she could put two and two together .
what do you think is the least is the thing she liked the least ?
probably the baby doll .
isabelle .
isabelle .
that's i know .
come on .
and how do you usually deal with you know if she gets is disinterested in something ?
how do you get her to come back to you ?
to get back to that ?
usually have to like pick her up .
and you know whatever she's .
you're okay !
put her in a new environment almost .
so she can't see .
i know .
you can see it .
i know .
you can see it !
so you want to go right for it .
i know .
i know you love the chords .
okay .
okay .
alright well i think she's ready .
boy .
no .
come on .
come on sweetie .
boy .
okay .
so vocal .
haha come on mom !
at some point .
some point we'll get there .
okay .
is it okay if i start asking you some questions ?
did you notice anything different this time from since the last time ?
last time she liked this thing .
a lot .
i think because of the .
plastic .
nastiness on its head .
and i tried to .
like see if like she would remember it .
and she really wanted to have nothing to do with that .
she was really into the plates .
this time .
like she kept going back for them no matter .
if i gave her a toy or she picked up another toy she always went back to those .
so and she's a lot more .
bouncy i guess this time .
like she she's getting into it more i think .
so you think the plates were the number one ?
favorite today .
what were some other things that she thought were that she played with ?
i th .
don't don't eat that .
i think like the spoons and the keys .
too .
i think it's .
the plastic sound .
like the sound of plastic .
because like she picked up .
the deer and .
a couple other things .
but they were just quick like okay i'm done with that .
so .
so it's more noise than texture .
what are some .
things .
do you play with these similar .
is that what she's doing at home as well ?
we have like a set of those keys at home that she plays with .
and she has a lot of sound toys .
like she has a little keyboard .
and she has like a set of keys that have like an alarm button on them .
that makes noise .
and she likes playing with the noise toys .
more at home too .
things that .
make noise .
so .
does she have does she not play with stuffed animals at home ?
or does she have stuffed animals at home ?
she has them .
she usually sleeps with them more than she more than she plays with them .
like she has a stuffed bunny that she can't go to sleep without .
like she has a couple things like during the day that i'll like give to her .
but she doesn't really doesn't really seem to play with them .
she usually plays with books a lot when she's at home .
and when i tried to give her the books here she wouldn't really .
we have good night moon .
but it isn't the counting version .
so like when i flipped to this page she kind of like i kind of perked up .
because it's the same as the good night moon book .
but i don't think we have any of these other books .
how about foods ?
no we didn't .
but we might have to .
do you think she recognized the names of any of the items she played with today ?
probably not .
like we don't have any pretend food .
and she's still eating just like oatmeal .
and bottle so .
but i don't think we have any animals like these .
like we have the typical bears and bunnies .
so she might have recognized book or baby .
she didn't want to have anything to do with the baby either .
she has a baby doll that she plays with .
and i only bring it out every once in a while because it's like almost as big as her .
it when i do she wants nothing to do with anything but that baby .
so .
tough work ?
do you do things with the does she usually play with the baby alone ?
what kinds of activities does she ?
she just .
yaps at it .
and like she'll give it like hugs and stuff .
but she doesn't really like associate anything with the baby just yet .
so .
i mean she t she likes to toss it around too .
unfortunately haha .
do you pl at home do you play any added activities ?
like at this age i always give the example of pattycake .
but of course that sounds funny .
like you know like those types of activities where you just engage with not really any toys .
we haven't mastered pattycake .
she does peekaboo .
and like for a few months it's been us going peekaboo .
but just the other day she started to do it herself .
like she pulled up her blanket .
and then when i say ".
where's masie ?
she'd pull it back down and start giggling .
and but she does that .
she does so big sometimes .
only when she really feels like it .
haha but it's nice .
actually quite normal .
but those are th really the only two that i can think of .
she likes to do that too .
and like if we do it back .
like make the same noise she made .
she'll make it again .
we do that too .
she's well on her way .
okay so at this point it's been about fifteen minutes .
so now i'm just going to ask you a few questions .
i'm not going to write down anything cause it will all be on the recorder .
so the first question is which of the toys seemed to interest your child the most ?
the food .
the food .
which do you think is a good toy for her personality ?
among the food choice or just ?
in general .
i think i think the the food toys are good for her cause she likes doing stuff that she sees us do .
she tries to do everything .
but she sees us do .
which is why it doesn't surprise me at all where when she when she played with the microphone first it's like tv remotes .
right .
cell phones .
palm pilots it's like mommy and daddy are playing with those .
that makes sense .
yes .
so and food is obviously something we spend a lot of time with .
which of the toys seemed to interest her the least ?
she didn't even look at the baby doll .
or she didn't notice the books either did i .
so .
right .
that whole bin .
that whole bin in general .
why do you think that is ?
i can't tell you for sure .
she may simply not have noticed them .
she was right by the stuffed animals when we put her down .
and then she saw the food and didn't seem to look up again after that .
so i'm not sure if there's anything uninteresting here .
right .
although she i've noticed in the last couple months that she's definitely not into books .
when i do try to read to her .
she closes them .
and i think that's more just lack of you know motor control .
but it's hard to finish a story so she doesn't know how cool stories can be .
we haven't read a whole lot or i should never haven't finished a whole lot of books .
okay .
do you think that there are any items that her interests have changed in since the last time you were here ?
i don't think so .
i remember playing with the food a lot .
i think she was a little more into books then .
right .
mostly cause she i think she haven't learned how to close them yet .
i'm looking forward to reading to her again but .
we're definitely in a stage where that's not working .
so .
so she's less interested in books than she was .
okay and more interested in the food you would say .
probably equally maybe a little more .
okay .
the next question is about books .
book would your child prefer to read or look at ?
she she likes anything .
that has a good rhythm to it .
like i remember mister brown can move .
from last time and .
at home .
i'm not even remembering which books go over better .
nothings going well right now as i already said twice .
but if it's a story .
interesting .
but if it's something that has more of a rhythm she .
she likes that .
more interesting .
does she play with similar toys at home ?
she really likes big toys at this point like pushing her little tigger plane around .
or she has another walker she likes emptying kitchen cupboards .
taking out things like pitch plastic pitchers and .
jars and stuff .
so she's more into big big stuff .
and at this point you would say she prefers toys over books ?
definitely .
definitely .
does she play with any dolls at home ?
nuhhuh .
do you ever play with pretend food or pretend to feed dolls at home ?
no we haven't .
do you think that she recognized any of the foods from the last time or from home ?
good question .
i want to give her real peas but we haven't done that yet .
so so she wouldn't know that these are the things she likes .
she loves peas .
no .
i don't think so .
i don't think she recognizes those .
cause for instance we don't eat ice cream off cones .
right .
so .
and and spaghetti goes through the blender before she gets it .
so .
no .
i don't think recognizes them .
the bottle .
she used to drink bottles .
that's been a while .
she started eating solid food at four months and stopped having a bottle like the same day .
so she still breast feeds .
but .
that bottle thing .
she much rather have cereal .
okay .
let's see .
at this point do you think she recognizes the names of any of these items or she .
or are there any other items that maybe aren't here that you think she would recognize the name of ?
i think she knows cereal .
which means cheerios .
the stuff that you mix up with formula and feed to her in a in a spoon i think that's food and not cereal .
but cereal .
and other than that it's hard to say cause she loves mashed up peas .
but when you tell her she's about to have peas does she really know that's going to be different than spaghetti ?
right .
i'm not absolutely sure but she smiles when you say peas .
so she might know peas .
that's spaghetti .
only it tastes like plastic .
i think she knows dog .
that's different than food but she has two puppies .
i think she knows dog .
great .
she may have said her first word yesterday .
well she .
we've taken all of two weeks of sign language class .
and the sign for all done is like this and she waved her hand and said .
and i was like .
that counts .
she hasn't repeated it yet though it could have just been a fluke .
i i as the proud mom of course i want to say was all done .
that's what i wanted to say because well .
i just think think you're fabulous .
but if she does it again then i'll then i'll .
really say it .
are you having fun ?
you are .
okay so some of these questions are the same as the ones before .
we just want to so get an idea if anything has changed as far as what he's what he likes or seems interested in .
okay .
okay so we which of these toys did he seem the most interested in ?
the plas hard plastic ones .
okay .
food items .
okay .
any of them in particular ?
i think he liked the cookie .
okay .
there's two .
cookies .
okay .
find the cookies .
where you going ?
if you hadta pick a toy that you would say is good for his personality what would you say ?
and why .
from here ?
i would probably say .
like the waffles or the .
anything hard and plastic .
he likes to .
pick things up and throw them and bang them around .
cookie !
okay .
cookie .
which of the toys seemed to interest him the least ?
the baby dolls and that kind of thing .
cords .
cords .
cords that aren't toys .
no play with toys .
he didn't seem interested in any of the books ?
he didn't seem interested in the books or .
okay .
or the baby doll .
it's okay .
it's okay .
no cords .
let's see what else we have .
do you think he recognizes the names of any of these ?
probably not .
i say some of them because .
well he doesn't eat a lot of cookies .
but he eats pizza and stuff .
but he probably wouldn't recognize the names .
is there any that .
i guess he had seen them last time so he .
i remember this one but i don't think he does .
okay .
but he liked the texture last time .
and he seems to still like it .
and do you have any of them at home ?
any similar .
n i mean we have a couple stuffed things at home .
but he doesn't really play with them anymore .
okay .
we don't really have anything else similar .
i mean we have books but .
what kind of books do you have ?
board books and then like books that we read to him that have textures .
i i don't even think we looked in this bin .
but we have something like this .
which we didn't even see .
we didn't even see the book .
do you play with pretend food at home ?
nope .
or dolls ?
nope .
nothing like that ?
okay .
i think that is all we have .
it's interesting now is it ?
his thing right now .
he's into things that aren't toys .
paper and cords and .
anything that can go in small pieces in his mouth .
okay .
let's put the toys away .
put the toys away .
zebra .
cookie .
so .
which of the toys seem to be of interest to her than most ?
and the cookies .
and the bee .
and i guess the bear little bit .
i mean i think it was similar in the sense that like i mean she's not doing a lot of interactive play like imaginative play yet .
she's still kind of mostly just exploring everything .
so it seems about the same i mean maybe a little bit more interested .
like like the functions of things like i mean she was able to engage to a limited amount you know a little bit more in the imaginative play but .
let's see .
the books she definitely she was not as interested in .
and .
i guess just some of the i mean some of the the stuffed animals she didn't they weren't as interesting to her they didn't like do things like tickle her or whatever .
what do you see he's saying hi to all the animals .
let's see which books do you think she would prefer to read or look at like any types of books .
she usually likes the ones that are interactive where she can feel things .
okay do you play with any similar toys at home now ?
i mean we have a baby doll that we've since the last time we came we've taken it out and we've played with it .
now but she's still mostly just like would give it kisses and like like look at it's eyes and stuff like that .
books we have a lot of and i don't .
i mean we have some stuffed animals but again like we don't play with them too much .
okay do you think she prefers books or toys in general ?
i guess toys .
and what does she like to do with them ?
do you ever pretend to feed them or anything ?
not really again we don't have pretend food yet .
and like the doll doesn't usually come to the table with us when we're eating .
so no i mean we don't really pretend to feed the baby much but we .
you know mostly she'll give it kisses and like we'll talk or whatever .
well for sure baby book .
bee maybe .
i mean there's enough toys that she has that like have bees on them like winnie the pooh bee stuff like that .
so she may recognize that .
puppy she should recognize .
and like i said some of the words and the like maybe like the ball and there stuff like that .
she knows the word ball but whether she understands it in a two thing i don't know .
okay .
that's it all set .
i just have a few questions for you .
okay .
okay so since his last visit have you did you notice any difference as far as interest in the different toys ?
he seemed more interested this time in .
i don't know .
i can't remember what he was .
i don't remember what was here last time if there was food or not .
we had the exact same toys .
okay .
so i'm just wondering if you if anything comes to mind .
like some of them come and they just like playing with one thing the entire time .
and like the next visit they pick some other one thing .
but it seems like he's .
he he seemed pretty diverse .
he liked the spoon for quite a while .
i don't i like i said i don't remember what he played with last time .
today so he seemed most interested would you say in the food toys or in the stuffed animals or ?
i think the food held his attention the longest .
so that's probably what he was most interested in .
okay .
which toys did he seem the least interested in ?
i guess the books .
he didn't really even touch .
them at all .
okay .
do you think there are any items that he recognizes the names for now ?
there are a few things .
but i i like you know different foods that he eats he seems to be excited about .
but i don't know that he he really recognizes them .
or if he's just hungry and wants food you know ?
it's hard to hard to tell sometimes .
so what food items do you think he's familiar with ?
right .
and he's had spaghetti .
but you know it doesn't look anything like that .
he's had some bread and he's seen me pull it apart .
but i don't know .
i don't know that anything really .
stands out .
what's wrong ?
look .
want to try that ?
want to try that ?
maybe ?
let's see what else we have .
do you have any of these toys at home ?
his brother has a food set .
not exactly the same but .
what about the books ?
are there any books that you see here that ?
we have put me to the zoo but not as a board book .
we have lots of doctor seuss but .
and we have the foot book .
and we have some books about the farm .
farm animals and .
from the animals do you think he recognizes any names ?
we have a couple books with a frog .
but his older brother doesn't like stuffed animals .
so .
we don't keep them .
very long .
okay .
he might have recognized the frog from a book .
does he play with pretend food with his brother ever ?
play with it in terms of mouth it and take it around the room yes .
okay i think that's all we have for you today .
okay .
let's go see what your brother's up to .
all right buddy .
go right ahead .
absolutely .
so what toys do you think seem to captivate her interest the .
most ?
seemed like the food one that it was last time too .
the food .
any sort of food in particular ?
or just like in general ?
i mean mostly she was playing with the pizza and the hamburger .
you were playing .
mostly those right ?
how did this visit compare to the last visit in terms of like .
what she played with ?
i think she played with a few more this time .
but not many .
she did play with those last time .
which is really funny .
because we don't have any .
food at home .
so it seemed it grabbed her attention both times .
she was much quieter this time i think .
just really it seemed strange .
she just seemed really quiet today .
do you think she knows the names for any of these items ?
no .
do you think any of them she recognizes ?
like like you have any at home that she'd recognize ?
the books .
she's used to books .
we actually have a couple of those .
but just books in general .
are you sharing ?
are you sharing with me ?
thank you so much .
that was yummy .
thank you !
we have so those i'm not surprised .
but .
what stuffed animals did she seem to like ?
you sharing again ?
thank you .
she wasn't really fascinated with any of them this time .
she didn't really gravitate towards any of them to stay with for .
any period .
does she watch any cartoons at home with like animals in them .
or ?
no not really .
if the tv's on it's of her brother's shows .
so she does .
we haven't any like watched any of the like really baby ones .
or einstein any of that kind of .
so unfortunately you're not seeing those on tv are you ?
no you're not .
nope .
nope .
in general what toy or story seemed to interest her the most ?
at home or here ?
anywhere like .
anywhere ?
you're into cars and vehicles .
because your brothers play with them all the .
time .
you're just like your big brother .
she is like her brothers .
she chases them and follows them around .
what else do you tend to like now ?
you like .
what do you like ?
you like playing the music ones .
you like banging things around .
airplanes .
and so you usually .
go over to the boy's toys instead of the baby toys .
i know .
and trying to walk .
that fascinates her walking around .
getting as far as she can .
on .
furniture .
and exploring how far she can move over .
right ?
sounds like a fun life .
it is it's a pretty good life !
was she interested in the baby doll at all or ?
not so much today .
a little bit more last time .
but she does have a baby doll at home .
and she will play with that on occasion .
i don't know ?
maybe this one was just too big ?
well just because there were so many other fun things to try .
what did you like today ?
what did you like ?
so many choices .
you really like that pizza .
she does like the pizza .
you like all the colors on that ?
or is it just a really good size for your hand ?
and you like the microphone now .
can you let got of that ?
thanks .
did you hear it making noise ?
i heard it .
from you grabbing it .
i heard it .
so you said you don't think she knows the name for any of these ?
or recognizes them ?
i really don't .
i mean she's a good eater .
so she eats a lot of food .
but i don't think she recognizes if we say do you want cheese or .
pizza .
i don't think she she knows knows that yet .
i don't .
i think you recognize your name .
and when we say mommy and daddy .
i don't think you got like .
animals .
or food yet .
how old are her brothers ?
three and five and a half .
they look out for you ?
they do !
usually .
what .
like i said the vehicles anything that moves .
they'll run around in the house in a circle .
and she will crawl around and chase them .
even though she gets lapped over and over .
she will continue to rotate around the same circle with them .
don't you ?
you do !
you do !
and they'll sing to her .
and then when we do any kind of little .
songs .
they try to jump in with us and do them too .
right ?
will they sing their abc's to you ?
or if we do ride a horsie into town .
your brothers always have to get in on it with you .
she's not used to this much time i think though .
you know one-on-one time for thirty minutes ?
is that's impressive !
isn't it ?
you getting upset ?
you want that microphone ?
where you going to go ?
where you going to go ?
should we get another one ?
what do you see ?
do you see winnie the pooh ?
where's winnie ?
no .
okay .
i'm a hold you .
i promise .
what ?
i know .
you getting hungry ?
what ?
well if i mean that's pretty much all .
that was all the questions ?
okay !
just when do you think you could come in for her third visit ?
because we try and schedule one like ten months and then another .
one eleven months .
okay .
we can talk with .
you have a calendar handy or ?
now do you want her to be eleven months or around then ?
around then .
you can go .
she's very strange usually .
she's like, i really expected her to be over to those wires .
and peeling everything .
she seems obsessed with the plastic food .
cause it's nearly lunch time .
yah she's a lot .
she was chewing on those peas .
quite a bit .
again i'm not sure the color or the feel .
she obviously doesn't know they're peas .
and the pear .
but , yah i think i said this last session i needta get her some plastic food because she seems to like it .
did she like those last sessions ?
yah .
and i haven't got her any .
you know, so this is the second time she's seen it .
then plastic toys .
we got this structure .
was she interested in any of the soft toys at all ?
not really .
i mean, like when i she knows when i do a frog at home and go .
she was smiling .
so she recognized that one ?
she seemed she smiled .
and i do that at home and she smiles .
how about the books, i .
yah, she could, we have a peekaboo book at home that she really quite likes .
and she tries to turn the pages and lift the thing .
but she she seems more interested in the plastic foods then the book .
no not really, it's not enough for her i would expect .
and she's at the wire .
but normally she'd i'd have been chasing her around the room .
we play in the basement and there's like one wire, and she goes straight for the wire .
yes .
but last time i don't think she was really crawling .
she was, you know this time she can crawl .
almost walk .
she still didn't move .
strange .
has she started eating any of these types of foods yet ?
she's had like spaghetti bolognese .
some baby form and peas .
and that looks like zweiback bread, which is a german twice baked bread .
so i thought she'd associate that cause it really looks like it .
and the rest she really wouldn't recognize .
pears, yah she would know pears .
does she do that at home ?
yah .
usually like reaches .
and the peekaboo books she'll like try and and you know usually bends the peekaboo book .
and, but she, she really was showing no interest in the first session .
she enjoyed the spoons and the food .
and do you go over animals noises with her a lot ?
yah yah, i do that a lot .
like i say like the frogs .
when you do it she smiles like as if there was a recognition .
she might have just have been smiling at the actualy sound of the noise .
i don't know, but there seemed to be some sort of recognition there .
i don't really do any other animal noises i don't think .
there was no all the animals i didn't know what noise they made .
i didn't know what that is .
or that, so .
and she did the cock a doodle doo obviously .
no .
i think she can .
because we have a cat .
okay .
she's more interested in my mic .
she's like there's something new on your shirt i want that .
i know .
you can't have that .
can i ask mom some questions ?
so the first question i have for you is whether you've noticed any changes in her preferences for toys since the last time ?
or whether you think she's playing with the toys differently then she was the last time she was here .
i think the last time we were here she didn't really play she just kinda sat and i just kinda handed her things where now she's pulling things .
and now that we're done with that you're going to talk .
dada .
get down yes get down .
now she's picking .
like she wanted the frog she saw it she went after it .
she really wants the door knob .
so while we're in here she wants she really likes the door knobs at home .
so that's where she's going .
and so what does she do just ?
she wants to she just wants to get to the knobs any knob .
she's very interested in knobs .
dresser drawers she pulls them open and dumps all of the clothes out .
and we have an armoire in the living room that has the knobs on .
she walks she holds on to the knobs and walks .
she really likes door knobs .
i'm not really sure what it is about the shiny things but .
she's into it .
she saw it first that's why i kept trying to turn around .
she was going to go for the door .
it's like i want that .
see she's still looking at it .
so she'd rather have that than any of these toys .
than any of it .
she would take that if i let her play with that knob the whole time we were here she would play with it .
it's like you can't have that between that and this microphone .
alright well clearly there were some other things that interested her besides these but of these toys what do you think she was most interested in ?
anything that makes noise .
so she really liked the keys and the spoons because they make noise .
she shook the bottle but it didn't make any noise .
right it didn't make any noise ?
and she did play with the frog and the rooster .
you going to beat me up with winnie the pooh ?
so she liked these two things here .
the noise .
i think they were the only things that made noise .
she had the waffles and she banged them and then she put them down .
and now she is looking at something else now that we're talking but okay .
it's because i put her over here .
i think when i sat her in the middle there's so many choices .
she didn't know .
she's familiar with the baby doll because we have one at home .
so she went straight for that .
that's what i was going to ask you too actually .
of these toys do you have for instance dishes play food or anything like that ?
no i actually don't have play food .
i thought she was a little young for play food since she still puts everything in her mouth .
we don't have play food but we have lots of things that .
we have keys and things like that that makes noise and little balls that go in the little things and she bangs them .
can you say thank you ?
no ?
you're thinking about it .
you can't eat the paper .
and so she doesn't have these types of things but she has a baby doll ?
she has a doll and she has keys and we have a few stuffed animals but not not very many .
and how interested is she in those at home ?
she carries the baby doll around but she leaves it .
she likes to bang things .
she's really into anything that makes noise so that's why she kept going back to the keys .
she's very sociable .
so she kept going back to those things that made noise ?
that's pretty much .
i tried to get her to play with the pizza the book .
we have books and stuff at home .
do you read them ?
at night usually at bedtime .
she has her favorite book so she really wasn't i don't usually read during the day but when we're going to bed .
she gets a book so .
if this was more like bedtime .
she probably would've sat but she sat there but she didn't pull away .
she opened this one and then she closed it back because i started reading it she closed it back up .
she's like okay i'm done with that .
and i read this one a couple of these pages of this one .
but she wasn't paying any attention so i put it back .
okay .
and which of these toys do you think are good for her personality ?
there all probably good for her .
she just right now only likes the noise making ones .
okay .
i don't even know why just very interesting .
we were just discussing that at home .
anything i have maracas they make noise .
i have clappers .
everything that makes noise a variety of things but she always goes for the noise makers .
she's going to be loud .
just tells me she's going to be loud .
you're very quiet no talking .
which do you think interested her the least ?
i do not know she was into some of them .
but not very many .
the books .
well but i think more because she's accustomed to getting a book at night and it's not .
okay .
so you'd say the stuffed animals probably ?
do you think there are any of these items that she would recognize the name for ?
outside of the baby doll probably not .
and maybe book she probably knows she knows what a book is .
okay .
so when i say on the bed .
i put the book on the bed and she goes and pulls the book when it's time to go to bed .
she pulls out we have the global baby's book .
and it just has pictures of babies in it .
and she opens it and points to the babies .
so i think she would recognize that book as a book but i don't know that she would recognize other things as a book .
i see okay and how about the bottle ?
well she is nursed so she doesn't really gets a bottle .
so she was interested in it but not because she recognized it ?
right we don't normally she's maybe had well she actually had a bottle the other day .
so i don't think she was that interested .
okay .
she doesn't recognize it because we don't use it enough .
so you think she was looking for it to make noise .
she kept turning it over and i think she was interested in the bubbles .
but it makes bubbles .
so once she saw it make bubbles she was trying to get to the bubbles .
and now she's trying to open the baby doll's eyes .
ours doesn't the eyes don't close on our doll .
she's going to clean it up .
she's into everything .
back to the bottle .
so there were some items you think she probably hasn't seen or heard of before ?
probably most of the food .
i mean we have real food at home but none of the .
like she's seen pizza before .
we've eaten the pizza but no it doesn't look like the pizza we've had .
but the food i mean we don't i don't know maybe i should get food for home but we don't have we have stuffed animal and baby dolls and books but we don't have the food so .
its just more to see whether these are novel items or if there completely new to her or whether they are something she plays with at home or a sibling at home .
that's really .
if there were cars in here .
okay and then i think there's one more thing .
does she ever pretend to feed the baby doll ?
no i haven't seen her .
put .
anything in any other things mouth .
no no i'm sure that's coming but probably because she doesn't really take a bottle .
right right .
so and now she really wants to drink from a cup .
a straw or a cup .
she would prefer to have either of those .
i'm getting teeth .
say the bottom ones and the top .
almost in all the way .
i'm like i'm getting teeth .
almost almost .
is there anything else ?
i think i've asked all the questions i have .
anything else you want to add or things i should take note of ?
no i know they called and asked if she had an ear infection .
but she didn't and before we came the last time we had just come from the wanted her to have her hearing tested .
but she didn't see anything in there .
okay .
okay .
and .
do you have any concerns about her hearing ?
no it's just where she had the ear infections and the pediatrician sent her .
but the said there was nothing in her ears so i'm assuming if there's no fluid then .
right .
but she could probably hear a pin drop .
and then that i mean she .
her hearing is probably just fine .
she definitely if somebody is moving somewhere she's looking to see .
what's that ?
alright that's all i have are you .
i can take the microphone now .
it's .
alright .
she's probably done .
next question so if i could just interview you really quick .
then you guys .
okay .
then .
sure .
okay .
okay .
and he can just .
you want to keep playing hehe ?
you can .
you you can keep playing .
you can just .
okay .
you keep playing .
well i don't know if you remember .
exactly .
what he liked the first time .
but did you notice .
or remember any changes from what he played with ?
i remember that last time he played with the stuff that was similar to what we had at our house .
you want me to read it ?
in a minute little guy .
okay .
and i kind of the same .
this time .
the waffles like we have waffles at home .
that are pretty much the same .
and we have other food to but the ones that are the same as what we have are the pizza and the waffles .
the other ones are just a little bit different .
and he kinda picked .
and those are the ones he picked out .
the clock i don't .
we don't have a clock .
so i was surprised that he picked that up but .
i do not know if it was the texture maybe .
the foam .
cause we have some foam things at home and he likes those .
too .
and the baby i do not know .
maybe cause of leah .
haha .
he likes the baby .
and we don't have a lot of .
babies .
at home at all .
so .
i do not know .
and we do read all the time .
so .
so you would say i was going to .
he's very comfortable with the books and he tries to turn the pages all the time at home .
he seems really familiar with .
are there any of these you have at home or ?
we have a peekaboo book its not exactly the same but its really similar .
where it says something .
a question .
and then you open it and there's a baby that says ".
peekaboo .
so that one's really similar .
the other ones are not .
he doesn't have the zoo one .
no .
no .
okay .
let's see .
which toys do you think interested him most would you answer the same way the ones that are familiar ?
it seems like the ones that are f .
i think just the ones that are most familiar .
besides the clock i do not know that one seemed a little more random .
okay .
and it looked like .
does he play with baby dolls at home ?
not really .
he seems .
doing some feeding are you guys were or something ?
to eat .
we don't really she did my daughter does that with her stuffed animals .
so and maybe and he's just now getting into food .
so it may just be from that .
that's just pretend .
do you play any sorta of ?
just pretend .
little games hide and seek and that kind of stuff ?
we do peekaboo a lot .
and .
his sister does peekaboo with him all the time .
too .
so .
his sister .
when she's not crying heehee .
ha !
she likes to play with them .
that one's not real .
i'll feed you in the car .
i'll feed you in the car .
you answered that already answered that already .
do you think he prefers books or toys ?
books or toys or does it depend .
on ?
it kinda depends on his mood i've .
the only time i could get him to really sit for a book .
really calmly is when he's .
tired or right before a nap or before bedtime the rest of the time he just wants .
flip through .
randomly or eat it .
but sometimes hehe .
or putting it in his mouth .
or eating it .
and he didn't seem to to i do not know if that was .
it might've been cause i was blocking i do not know .
stuffed animal talking ?
not really .
we have a bunch .
she's obsessed with them but he doesn't really get into them no also she tells him no he can't so maybe that's why haha .
he's a good listener ?
hah .
okay and you said he doesn't necessarily pretend to do any feeding at home with .
no .
no .
okay .
and about any changes you said it's pretty much the same that ?
similar .
things that he has .
seemed that way .
okay and i noticed does ?
does he know body parts or do you do body parts ?
he doesn't seem to .
we do them a lot but i haven't noticed him consistently .
so he wasn't necessarily .
knowing them or pointing to them no i don't think so .
okay .
and .
what's yummy ?
are you sharing ?
that's your new thing .
you hold it out and go .
that's a ducky !
it's a ducky !
and a sheep .
there's leah !
can you see that she's looking ?
alright .
alright .
i hope i didn't forget to ask you anything .
is there anything .
that stands out to you about the way he interacts with toys or what he his preferences are anything like ?
not really .
no .
okay .
nope .
alright .
alright the next time we see you we'll just .
next time we'll live leah with daddy heehee .
i was surprised she's .
i do not know she was .
she was tired .
she was tired she was sick last weekend and now now she has a tooth so its just a lot of things .
its hard for her .
its you know he's been getting all the attention .
and he's getting attention from me which she doesn't love .
come back and turn this way .
hi honey do you want to come to see the toys .
okay .
sure .
he can he can keep playing .
in terms of how he's playing and what he's playing with have there been any changes that you've noticed since the last time you were here ?
he's using objects more purposefully .
you know like banging things together .
and .
books .
he'll get books and turn pages in books in board books and things like that .
so .
did he was he interested in it ?
last time .
and he he has one at home .
and he seems to like .
the babies .
he'll gi he'll hug his baby at home and give it kisses .
that's interesting .
much to his daddy's .
dislike .
daddy's get that way .
yes they do .
i think it's sweet .
okay so he's playing more purposefully .
he likes books a little bit more ?
so he'll take them and turn pages and stuff ?
the board books .
and he listens better to them .
you can read stories that he's familiar with .
he really likes books with babies in them real pictures of babies in them .
he'll watch those and even .
i think he's starting to anticipate .
there's one book in particular he likes where it says and then you turn the page and boo .
and he always seems to .
anticipate that .
and he'll smile .
when he knows that part's coming up .
so he's .
is he familiar with any of the books that are here ?
no .
no .
nope .
and do you think that he prefers books or toys ?
toys i think .
okay .
which of the toys do you think are most interesting to him at this age now ?
from here ?
i think he's more interesting in this that he can hold in his hands and bang together .
and then he seemed to like i think the texture here of of something like this .
you going to eat that ?
how about in terms of home ?
what does he like the most of toys ?
blocks and cups .
he likes cups a lot .
that but more if you build them up he'll knock them down .
and he likes to bang them together .
he's not you know putting things in them or or pouring things out of them .
he likes things that he can shake too .
rattles he tends to go to those .
things that make noise too .
yes you do like that .
which of the toys here do you think interested him the least ?
the animals .
animals .
the stuffed animals .
does he have any of those at home ?
he has a few but not very many so .
and how does he .
he doesn't usually pay much attention .
when they're new when they first come out he will .
and then .
they tend to be put away .
he doesn't or he leaves them in the in his basket .
he doesn't pull them out .
okay .
he te he'll pull them out .
he doesn't play with them i guess i should say .
he likes to take things out .
and he just sort of tosses it aside .
you get the feeling it could be anything .
yes .
let's see .
so do you think his interest in type of toy has changed since the last time ?
i think .
well .
no he seems to be playing with the same toys just in a more purposeful .
way .
great .
you said he has a baby at home and plays with it .
he turns pages of the board book .
and does he have kitchen and food items like that at home like we have here ?
no .
he doesn't have those .
and you know i i don't know so much that it's board books that he's able to manipulate .
it's more the bath books .
those are the ones that i see him kinda turning .
more so .
now that i think about it .
okay they're the ones you mean .
the plasticy ones ?
the the ones that can go right in .
because he these are i think harder for him .
he'll if he's sitting on your lap he'll try to turn it .
but it's usually many pages at once that get turned .
you want that .
what does when he plays with the baby what does he like to do ?
he'll hold it up .
and a lot of times he'll put the feet or the hands in his mouth .
he'll babble to it .
he'll give it sometimes if you tell him give the baby a hug he'll you know bring it to him .
he puts his mouth on the head .
which we say he's kissing it but i don't know that that he is .
right ?
what ?
can't get up ?
push .
that's interesting because a lot of the kids at this age don't like the baby .
really ?
so that's interesting .
okay does he so he doesn't sound like he is feeding the baby or .
no he doesn't do things like that .
and then i think the last thing is at this point do you think he recognizes the names of any of the items here or beginning to recognize any names ?
the the objects that are here ?
no .
probably not .
maybe the baby a little bit because .
more so at home though i think if you say that he does know .
which is his baby .
the toys that he has at home .
a the baby's probably the only one that he really .
sort of knows and not not consistently i wouldn't say .
okay .
i think that's about it .
is there anything that i didn't ask you that you think would be helpful to know about how he plays or what he plays with at this stage ?
no .
no this is pre .
he's happy playing by himself ?
he is .
he's pretty good about that .
and he's he i i noticed he doesn't he's quiet a lot of times when he's playing .
whereas if he's in the car he makes he seems to make more noises and more babbling .
but he seems quiet when he gets new toys and things like that very focused on them and .
and he can he can sit for entertain himself it seems like .
that's great .
okay well that's all i hadta ask you .
that the cookie ?
we're all done ?
can i take this off ?
you can take you can leave it there until we're done .
okay .
you keep playing .
so i just wanted to .
ask you .
there's been a little time since you were here last because i think he's around ten months now ?
he's ten months .
do you i don't know if you remember what it was like when you were here before .
but do you notice any changes in his interest .
in this stuff ?
like is he .
more interested in s things this time than he was last time or ?
i mean he's still putting everything in his mouth .
i mean because that's still where he is .
he's using some things appropriately .
like he recognizes now he's eating food more regularly .
so he recognized the spoon .
and which and he put the right side of the spoon in his mouth .
and he did that with the bottle and the sippy cup .
and i think last time he was kind of just chewing on everything .
okay .
and now he's chewing on the bottom of the bottle but .
but there's some recognition .
and he went from books .
he does spend a lot of time with books .
at home .
but again they often wind up in his mouth too .
but he can flip through the pages and stuff .
really ?
he doesn't the only time we really do dolls is to keep him interested on the changing table .
so and he doesn't have a baby doll at home .
so .
do you think he was interested in ?
well he was definitely interested in the face .
he's he always seems interested in like eyes .
when he saw the clock he touched the eyes .
and when he saw the baby he touched the eyes .
and he does that with a couple of his books too .
i don't know what it is about eyes .
i think he was a little interested in the face at first .
because he was touching all the different parts .
and the mouth .
but then again then he just wanted to to lick it .
i heard you doing something about feeding the baby .
did that did was he interested in that ?
i don't know if he realized what i was doing .
i mean i was just trying to model .
he doesn't really do any pretend play yet .
but .
and it was when i gave something to the baby then he wanted it in his mouth so .
right okay .
so he doesn't want to miss out on anything .
let's see .
so at this point in his development what do you think .
he's .
now he's giving .
you giving the baby the ?
that's so nice you're sharing !
at this point in development what do you think is best sorts of toys for his personality and his stage of development ?
excuse you .
i mean he's really for the most part interested in a lot of gross motor things .
so now he wants to .
i mean what he chooses at home are kind of the big things .
things that he can pull up on .
things he can climb over .
plays with balls and blocks a lot .
and he has a bunch of toys that you know if you do something to them they make a noise or something .
he likes those .
and he's got a fish bowl that he puts the fish in and out of that he likes .
bangs stuff together .
i mean it's still a lot of making noise .
i saw that .
i saw him doing that a little bit .
like when you put him to bed we have a couple put a couple like chewy toys in his bed with him .
and he bangs them on his crib for a little while before he falls asleep .
and that's just playing .
i mean he's not angry .
that's just how he's entertaining himself .
he likes to put them through and watch them fall to the floor .
so i think now that he's only been crawling for a few weeks .
so i think he's realizing that he can get new perspectives on things .
so i think he's kind of just .
exploring that .
pulling himself up on everything .
pulling himself up on stairs .
it's opening up a lot of possibilities for him .
i mean he loves to .
sit in the kitchen and play with the tupperware and things like that .
okay so speaking of the kitchen i don't know if you have these kinds of toys at home .
we don't .
was he interested in .
the dishes the food just the whole thing ?
or what do you think ?
he seemed to go for the food more .
okay .
well the pizza is kind of what the pizza and the cookies kept him for the most part .
and why do you think is there some quality of the toy itself ?
or do you think he recognizes ?
he's never had pizza .
he doesn't eat these foods yet .
i think the this has a little give .
so it was nice to chew on .
i think the fact that there were a couple of them .
was kind of interesting to him .
but no he doesn't eat any pizza or cookies yet .
do you think colors attract him at all ?
i noticed the pizzas are kind of colorful .
that c that could be .
and i'm just wondering if you've noticed that at home either .
i mean everything at home is colorful .
all of his toys are colorful but .
true .
he just he just pooped .
don't put your fingers in it .
that's exciting !
let's see .
so you did look at the book a little bit .
he you said he wasn't so interested in that ?
he wasn't that interested in it .
but he does books at home .
he does do books .
and we do books .
as part of his nighttime routine .
and then he also has books just like in his toy chest .
and he'll pull out and we put all the touchy feely books in his toy chest .
so he'll go through them and touch the things .
and eventually just chew on the book .
and you said he likes to turn pages .
he does turn pages .
alright .
honey we're not going to chew on that because that could get ruined .
here chew on the pizza .
so would you say he prefers books or toys ?
he prefers toys i think .
okay .
and you i think you said he doesn't have d he has some things like this on the changing table but .
but it's really just for us to keep him occupied while he's changing .
okay and no baby dolls at home ?
okay so this one was new .
this was new .
and he'll do the same thing when he sees a baby .
too .
he'll want to touch the face .
and even when he sees kids .
socially .
he'll always wants to go for their face .
i think really tiny infants are really attracted to the face .
but when he sees kids he wants to touch their face .
right .
and so he doesn't have dolls .
so he doesn't pretend to feed dolls at home .
does he and do you have pretend food ?
or no ?
okay so he doesn't do that .
so you said he doesn't really eat these kinds of food .
what do you .
but he he eats .
peas .
he eats peas okay .
but i mean he's still doing a lot of .
i think he pooped .
it stinks .
his food is mostly pureed now too though .
the only things he kind of eats in chunks are like strawberries and pears .
so he wouldn't he wouldn't really recognize icecream or bread or anything .
he wouldn't recognize that .
his food is all still pretty little .
okay .
let's see .
do you think there's any like you said he's he used the spoon appropriately .
are there any words names here that he would you think he might recognize ?
like spoon or bread or some of the things that you were saying ?
of the stuff here ?
is probably the .
and then the sippy cup .
okay .
because i don't know that i ever talked to him about spoons .
no he only has bowls .
he doesn't have plates .
okay .
i think that might be all the questions that i have .
okay mommy's going to .
which would you say would interest him the least ?
these things here ?
i think so .
okay .
i think that's it .
anything that i should know that about his toy preferences other than what you've told me ?
i don't think so .
okay .
well we'll get another chance to do this f at your next visit .
which .
i mean should i get some of these things ?
would that ?
no no that's okay .
th we were sort of interested in how .
because this stuff i stuff i think is still .
a little old for him .
he'll come back at two years also .
and develops .
we should probably get him a baby doll .
so that he learns about body parts and stuff like that .
he seems to like it .
he has i mean he's got stuffed animals at home .
but nothing that's humanlike .
so that's probably a good idea .
alright well we can be all done .
i'm going to change him before we go .
i have a few questions for you .
okay .
so do you remember what she liked last time and has it changed ?
i think she focused on the food a lot last time and she's focusing on the food this time too .
anything in particular ?
food items ?
she likes this meat .
and i don't why because it's not very colorful .
maybe it looks really like it's real so she she's kind of eating some real table food so she might be more appe it might be more appealing than some of the stuff that doesn't look as real .
maybe it hasta do with the texture ?
maybe .
little bumpy .
and she's teething it could be soothing her .
but she's not sucking on it really for her gums so i'm not sure what she why she likes that .
she te she was g she liked the doll at first and she does seem to like babydolls when we see them in the store and what not .
she's just very nurturing already .
she likes to feed things .
that's about all she .
she could be just hungry but she just seems like that's her focus is to feed it whatever it is .
she was feeding the dogs .
but she wasn't as interested in the stuffed toys .
i think last time she did play with them a little bit .
she was really not interested this time .
especially not unless they were the two little dogs .
if it was pooh she looked she didn't want to even look at pooh .
she likes the spoons .
i don't know .
what her fascination is with spoons she's that way at home too .
and she didn't really give me much attention on the books .
normally she likes books .
so i can't say she's necessarily going for the things with lots of color .
she seems a little interested in this bottle .
and she's not nearly as talkative as she normally would be but maybe that's because there's so many things in front of her .
what's that ?
what did you find ?
spaghetti .
you had spaghetti last night for dinner !
i was going to ask you do you think she recognizes any of the food items or anything ?
maybe the icecream .
this might have been interesting because of the colors i'm not sure .
it looks interesting .
and she does she's not really eating icecream so i'm not sure if she's .
relating the two .
she could be looking at that spaghetti and thinking it looks similar .
she ate the noodles last night .
she likes keys .
she didn't play with it as long as i thought she would .
but she did at least look at it and kind of hold it and twist it around a little bit .
and she really i think her favorite thing was these peas .
so i do not know if it's the texture the color she eats a lot of peas so .
she could think they're real .
are her peas that she eats are they like mushed up or are they ?
nope .
she did eat mushed peas but now she's eating regular peas .
she likes peas and carrots that's her favorite food .
so she could have thought those were real .
definitely .
yep .
that's about .
but she seemed annoyed when i kept trying to show her the stuffed animals .
i want food !
i want to eat .
look kennipoo .
you going to feed them peanut butt .
you like this one ?
okay .
you like his shiny hat .
you going to feed him some dinner ?
i'm hungry kennedy .
can you please give me some cookie ?
please ?
kennedy .
excuse me .
can i please have a cookie ?
i notice she kisses most of the stuff too .
whatever it is she kinda kisses it .
or bites it .
kennedy .
your friend is awake .
kennedy .
you like her eyes ?
eyes .
mouth .
mouth .
eyes .
eyes .
eyes .
good job sweetie .
eye .
eye .
eye .
eyes that's right !
eye !
eye .
that's right .
eyes !
you like her eyes ?
her hair ?
can you say hair ?
hair .
don't hurt the baby .
say hair .
don't hurt the baby .
kennedy !
why are you pulling her hair out ?
you don't like the baby ?
hair .
hair .
hair .
eyes you like eyes .
do you have babies at home ?
she loves like babydolls .
she's kinda young to like them but she does .
don't hurt the baby !
why are you hurting the baby ?
she's your size baby .
so do you read a lot to her ?
and do you have any of these books at home ?
or similar ?
i have similar things not these .
this one looks kinda familiar actually .
no .
i don't have any of these .
i have one like that with the touching with the different textures .
and we do read a lot of doctor seuss they're just not small like this .
but i have baby books for her .
that size .
what else was i going to ask ?
do you have lots of toys at home that make a lot of noise or what's her thing ?
does she like toys that make noise or ?
like is it more babies or is it more reading ?
she likes noisy toys .
the stuff that she can bang on and it would like she's got the little piano thing where you stand up and walk around it and it has different sections on there where it makes different sounds .
and then she's got a we got it for christmas a microphone toy .
so she likes to turn the microphone all the way high .
and then yell in it .
nice .
and stick it in her mouth and yell .
so that's probably her favorite thing to do with them with her toys .
and she likes babydolls .
she likes the ones that move .
you know with batteries or something but .
those are probab .
stuff that lights up .
probably is the most interesting to her .
and she likes to watch movies like intently .
she doesn't even take her gaze off the movie it's weird .
because we have movies in the car and she just the whole time she's watching the movie doesn't like to be interrupted .
okay .
you can take her to a movie theater earlier than most kids .
probably i could .
i haven't really tried that .
my husband took her and said she was fine .
but in the car she watches movies all day all the time .
in the car .
do you play games with her like pattycake or anything like that ?
what other types of games do you play with her ?
peekaboo pattycake i'll hide stuff behind my back or under something and see if she can find it .
she wants she likes to crawl down the hall and i come and chase her and grab her and say come back kennipoo and she'll laugh hard super hard .
she thinks that's the funniest thing in the world .
so i guess the chase we'll i'll chase her down the hall .
she likes to think she's going to get away with something .
god bless you !
god bless you baby !
so she'll take something and that she knows she shouldn't have like a pen or something .
and she'll look at me and then she'll try to run with it .
because she knows she shouldn't have it .
and she laughs really hard when i'm trying to get it from her so she thinks that's so funny .
that's funny .
she's testing you already .
is that your favorite ?
i think it is .
like why are they not coming apart ?
i think that they do look the most real maybe out of all the foods .
probably .
do you have any food items at home ?
we have a full kitchen in our play room .
she doesn't really play with that food though maybe she's not interested yet .
or it's in her house so she's not .
but she .
and actually she doesn't really like the play room that much which is strange because it's all primary colors and there's a big soft mat to walk around on and do stuff .
but i've brought her down there a few times and she just .
maybe she's overwhelmed i mean there's a lot of toys i have a lot of children .
she'll probably like it when she's older .
yep .
she was in a play .
for christmas .
she was ?
she was baby jesus in a big huge production .
that's great .
and she did really really well .
she didn't cry or anything .
little actress .
kennedy .
you like the peas honey ?
she's like i'm hungry .
i think she's trying to say that .
alright i think that's it .
okay .
do you have anything else to tell me ?
no .
she seems just like she's right where she should be .
she's doing fine .
and she's got older siblings .
a three year old a five year old and a seven year old .
so she's probably going to be a little advanced in terms of trying to learn to talk sooner .
i think my three year old .
i've never seen any child talk as as well as she did and as quickly as she did .
she was saying full sentences at eleven months .
she's not there .
she still babbles .
so who knows what'll happen with that .
i think it's great when when babies have like older siblings to look up to .
and just try to be like them .
and she's really close to walking .
i mean she'll stand for long periods of time .
she won't really take steps yet .
she likes to bounce i don't know what that's all about .
she's she can stand with balance and hold stuff .
she's she's really right there but she just won't do the steps .
she'll just start bouncing really hard and i'm like .
and she won't fall .
so it's like she knows how to do it she's got the balance she just needs to .
she might .
i think so .
i think she will .
she's ready .
really .
she just needs to do it .
which is going to be a whole other level of where are you kennedy ?
put up baby gates .
my goodness .
she's all over the place .
i've never used gates with any of my kids .
okay do you mind if i ask you a few questions ?
great .
did you notice any differences as far as what he liked to preferred to play with more this time than last time ?
no he stuck the plastic food in his mouth last time too .
it same general stuff because we have more plastic food at home .
he doesn't really care about stuffed animals .
and he still loves playing with wires .
okay haha .
he was beelining for the wires last time too .
do you think he recognized any of the names of the food ?
i don't know .
we've he doesn't eat .
any of this food .
i mean he's had mushed up peas before .
but i don't know if he'd .
specifically recognize the name of pizza or cookie or peas .
just because it's not food that he eats .
okay .
what about baby dolls ?
do you have baby dolls at home ?
we have his sister has a baby doll that he chews on her face sometimes .
is that what do you do you with him and .
how does he usually play with the baby doll ?
like i said they're his sister's .
so well there's two of them .
and they both belong to his sister .
she actually does the .
interactive you know i'm a mommy .
i'm taking care of my baby play .
he'll go over and kind of study the features .
like why is this little person not moving ?
and then like i said he just likes to try and chew on her face .
because it's it's another toy .
and he tastes tests everything .
anything can get in his mouth he puts there .
do you think he recognizes like hand shoe eye ?
those types of things .
some stuff .
like i think eyes nose .
i don't know if he knows shoe .
he might .
but i don't know how many of the body parts he really recognizes .
for me to say ".
this is the ear .
this is the hand .
this is the eye .
are you reading books at home ?
yup we read picture books together .
and you know like the little board books .
and then i'm still nursing him .
so i generally have one of my older children's books .
that i like alice in wonderland .
or i forget which one of the narnia ones is the one we just finished .
i think we're on harry potter now .
that i just read as you know as i'm nursing him .
so not that he's .
comprehending that .
but he's at least hearing it .
but then we do we do picture books and stuff .
what do you think he likes to play with more at home books or toys ?
toys .
he's much more into toys .
good boy .
do you have any similar of the s su of same books at home ?
we have good night moon .
we have mister brown can .
for some reason mister brown can is not a favorite at our house .
but good night moon generally is .
but we've got a lot of the other .
classic ones .
but he's just you know he'll chew on the covers .
but i have a two and a half year old who's way more interested in books and reading and stuff than he seems to be at the same ages .
but we all still read together .
what about the books like the touchy feely books ?
he's got a truck book that has different textures in it .
and he likes going through .
and he'll use the tip of his finger .
and he'll he'll you know touch each of the textured sections on the pages .
he does like the truck book .
do you think he likes at this stage more touching or like noises or ?
touching and things that he can hold easily in his hand .
he likes banging toys together .
we have a lot of little people .
and so he likes playing with those .
because they fit well in his hands .
and they've got detail .
and he'll look at them and then chew on them and look at them again .
and how about the farm animals ?
or the farm animals .
the stuffed animals ?
he's never really cared much for stuffed animals .
i think the reason that he played with this one is because it has the the funny hair .
the sticky hair which gave it a different texture .
but he doesn't really care about stuff animals .
so he's he's definitely into toys more than books or stuffed animals .
okay do you think there were any names like even of like domestic pets or animals maybe that you've seen books on ?
the names of them that he would be more familiar with ?
probably more familiar with like you know the regular domestic animals .
those .
you know like i don't think he knows otter and fox and eagle and fawn which are some of the and goose .
but you know he's i guess he's starting to comprehend the .
we have a little farm set at home .
so cow and horse and .
those he seems he chews on the lamb a lot .
so i'm like ".
that's the sheep .
that's the sheep .
but i don't if i said ".
that's the you know pick out the sheep .
if he would be able to .
go and select that one .
but we go through we generally do more teaching and explaining and talking about the toys than we do with books .
just because that's where his interest is .
is more with the toys .
so if you were to say what he was least interested in today .
stuffed animals .
and is that different from the last visit ?
no he didn't care about the stuffed animals last time either .
and he had only medium interest in the books .
but liked chewing on the fake food .
we have a l a kitchen set and a lot of fake food .
so this is most similar to the stuff that he plays with at home .
thank you .
does that rattle ?
and he was tr like i said he was trying to get the wires last time too .
but wires aren't one of your categories .
haha .
no you still can't play with them i'm sorry .
are the do you think he played similarly here today like he would at home with you ?
there's generally .
the toys aren't necessarily in concentrated piles .
so we spend more time kind of going around going from one thing to another .
i also have a two and half year old .
so a lot of the play that we do is focused around what she says she wants to play w .
you know we'll be playing with blocks .
and he'll come .
and he'll help by knocking over towers and sticking things in his mouth .
or we're playing in the kitchen .
and he sits over by us and puts things in his mouth .
common theme with him .
but i mean obviously it's a little more awkward to just be in a .
concentrated environment than when we're at home .
but because there's a lot more sibling interaction craziness going on .
at home .
but i mean just interacting and talking about stuff .
and i try and let him just explore a lot on his own .
and just you know it's fun to watch them sit and play with something and try and figure it out .
and you can just see the gears turning and .
see if you can help them out at some points with it .
and other times they don't really need you .
they just you know they're just having fun .
that's right .
do you think something with the toys hasta do with .
i asked you some type of variation on this but .
the colors or more the sounds ?
my inexpert opinion .
they bang together neat .
they make a sound when they bang together .
there's probably different flavors in the plastics .
different textures in the plastics and woods and stuff .
more opportunity for noise .
whereas stuffed animals i guess they all kind of taste the same .
he's also he's he's teething .
so i think it's also .
it feels good when he chews on hard plastic .
like it feels good on his gums to be able to gnaw on things .
i'm ready to just ask you a some few questions .
okay .
she can just play with what she wants .
hi there .
okay so first of all do you notice any difference between what she liked this time and last time ?
i .
don't think i remember .
i vaguely remember her chewing on this but .
otherwise .
no she mostly likes these .
so you would say she liked those the best today .
okay .
and do you think there's any particular reason why she likes those ?
she can chew on them .
and they make more noise when she's banging them together .
so those were her favorites .
how about .
what did you see .
she didn't touch any of the stuffed animals .
so .
although that was the first thing she was going towards before everything got before we started .
there's no further interest in ?
no .
and how about the baby doll is she interested in that at all ?
she's interested in the mic though .
no no baby .
i think she liked the the eyes opening and closing .
and she likes pulling on her eyes so i she liked the doll's ears too .
how about the book ?
is there any interest ?
no .
i mean they caught her eye for a second but .
was she .
you may not play with the microphone .
did she recognize the names of any of those ?
either the food items or the implements ?
maybe spoon .
but otherwise most of this is stuff she can't eat yet .
okay .
at least not in that format .
she can have peas but that's about it .
no ice cream yet ?
no ice cream .
no no cookies for you ?
no .
no cookies .
you just need a to be a little older .
okay so you think probably last time that she liked those same things .
do you notice any difference .
in the way she's playing with things .
between last time and now .
or let us say in the last two months .
what is it ?
do you have spoons ?
no we don't have a set of those .
where you going squirmy ?
does she have any .
toy at home that she's attached to that we don't have here ?
no not really she used to have a favorite little toy but .
she doesn't seem to care too much about it anymore .
now it's just whatever's around .
whatever's there .
she likes chewing on paper .
she also has a brother to play with .
yes .
okay let's see .
does she have any baby dolls at home ?
no not really .
okay .
okay .
she might see them at church but .
is she is she go to childcare .
the church ?
that might be her only time though .
no not yet .
where you going scrolly ?
but she kinda liked it didn't she ?
well she liked the the soft and she could .
sink her teeth into it .
so that's how you like to play .
so you'd say she probably likes books if she if they're good to chew ?
yep .
well unless you think there's something that we should know about what she likes or how she likes to play then i think that's all the questions i have .
she mostly just likes running around a chewing on stuff .
cause she's a pretty active kid ?
so would you say that has something to do with what she plays with ?
i i used to imagine that my kids would like to sit down and read books but .
not quite yet .
my son's getting there .
but mostly they just want to chew on them .
and other things .
ha ha .
you're silly .
you're so active and curious .
yes .
alright well then i can turn these things off and take the microphone away .
while he's playing let us .
you're doing a good job .
he's happy .
he is .
what did you just say he was doing ?
he's putting the .
he's putting all the toys behind him .
does he like to do that ?
there normally aren't this many toys at once .
so he likes to drop them on the other side of gates and behind furniture and things .
boy .
let's not play with the power cords .
i'll be the blocker .
i forgot i was connected to the cord .
surprised he hasn't found that yet .
so did you notice any differences between what he wanted to do today compared to last time he was here ?
if i remember last time .
that's the question .
last time he was very interested in these waffles .
okay .
he was chewing on it a lot .
guess he's been more interested in moving the toys around this time .
from one place to another .
throwing them around .
did he play with any particular item the most ?
you've got something there .
he played a lot with the plastic toys but i don't know if that's because he liked them best or because they're in the middle and that's where he was put down .
that's where he was put down .
but he does typically like things that are harder that he can gnaw on .
okay .
and .
it looks like he can pick up some of them too .
right .
he maybe eats some of the stuff whether he would recognize that it's the same thing i don't know .
what does he eat ?
that we have here .
peas .
there's bread but i mean it would be in pieces he wouldn't have a whole piece of bread .
not the wire .
pieces of little pieces of pizza but again it would be in baby size bits .
i guess everything would be .
little pieces of cheese .
okay .
he's got a cookie .
i mean he's had like just like little teeny tiny pieces of cookie .
but he's never been like given a whole cookie .
never a whole cookie ?
poor deprived child .
probably .
i heard you did you start with a book ?
or did he like any of the books ?
i mean he i think he picked up this one briefly and we started to read it .
got a couple pages and then he got distracted by something else .
okay .
we have some books similar to this at home with the feel touchy-feely .
farm animal type .
and how about the any of these animals ?
would he does he have anything like this at home ?
any stuffed animal type things ?
he does have some stuffed animals .
he's got a winnie the pooh .
he's got a few others .
but he's very usually not very interested in them .
at least for very long .
okay .
and then did he did you show him any of these we have here ?
i showed him some .
we played with the puppet .
and he thought that was .
i mean you know it was a talking puppet .
he thought that was fun .
he kinda gave the puppet the cookie or the puppet took it anyway and he thought that was funny .
and we read a couple pages of the peek a boo book because he really likes peek a boo .
which i guess is normal .
that's pretty normal a lot of kids like those things .
but he's ripped the we have one similar at home and he's ripped the one of the things off .
right he's ripped the flaps .
like that sorry .
they're very strong i think that's happened before .
and how about the baby ?
how about the baby did he see that ?
i don't know if he saw .
he didn't make it over that far .
does he is he in any kind of contact with younger infants ?
no i mean he doesn't have regular contact with other babies i mean occasional but not daily or anything .
some kids are really interested .
which is probably good because he'd gouge their eyes out and then bite their forehead .
right some kids are really interested in babies .
right because they .
checking it out .
he sure is .
especially those eyes ?
and i meant to ask i know does he have any thing like this at home some .
he has some sippy cups .
he picked this up and held it for a while but he didn't pretend to drink from it .
and not the bottle either .
no he's never had a bottle so .
here it is .
okay and then how i saw him putting toys behind did he do anything else with toys ?
he threw them .
doing that with them ?
are you giving me kisses ?
very expressive .
eat the baby's face .
let's see and .
let's see and i don't know if this is a question you can answer .
is the way he's playing typical for the way he'd play at home ?
well he hasn't attacked any baby dolls but then he doesn't normally play with those .
for the most part .
there aren't as many toys at once and he's usually more interested in exploring the room because he's familiar with those toys and .
so he'll you know he'll play with a toy and then he'll walk over and like i was saying his big thing is dropping it on the other side of the baby gate or behind the furniture .
sometimes he seems to want us to get them back and sometimes it's just a fun game to put them all somewhere else .
move the stuff around .
but he wants to explore everything with his mouth .
he's exploring the room now .
yes .
remote controls are some of this favorites .
okay .
and then we probably asked you last time but does he have i asked you about stuffed animals but does he have any of the plastic toys like that at home ?
i guess he doesn't have fake food .
but he has .
he has he has plastic teethers and i let him play with a plastic spatula or a plastic measuring cup of things like that .
in the kitchen .
we have some spoons here did he play with those ?
he didn't really he just kind of picked it up and pushed them aside .
okay so he saw it .
right .
very interesting .
well i wonder if he recognizes that as a human like .
i think he probably does because he .
you know a lot of babies will give baby kisses where they're just kind of attacking your face .
like he'll bite my and his dad's noses and stuff and kinda do like the open mouth thing to show affection .
at least we think that's what he's doing .
that's what he's doing to the baby .
of course the baby can't defend itself .
from more aggressive .
right .
from more aggressive affection .
and he i know you said he has books at home like the lift the flap do you think he prefers toys or books ?
at this stage .
i don't know i guess it depends .
i think he prefers things that aren't toys or books just objects that grownups are playing with .
i see .
but i don't know sometimes he likes us to read .
i mean a couple months ago you couldn't really get through an book because he'd just try to grab it and eat it and he still tries to eat books but he also will sit and let you read him a whole book .
okay .
so it depends on his mood i guess .
right and time of day .
first thing in the morning we often read books .
alright !
sure .
okay i didn't run the play session last time so can you tell me which toys she was most interested in last time as well ?
by far this one .
okay .
the bumblebee .
something about the hair .
she had a literally she had it in her mouth the whole time .
and were there any toys that she didn't seem to pay any attention to this time ?
i don't think the doll was here last time .
but .
li last time she didn't .
i figured she's pick up on this one the black and white .
she didn't pay any attention to that .
she didn't this time either .
i should've done the puppet .
she likes puppets .
what about today ?
which toys did she seem the most interested today ?
definitely the peas .
and i think the doll .
i don't she's never really seen a doll .
you know a doll baby like this .
i think that definitely .
caught her attention .
you trying to feed the peas to her ?
i don't think she knew what to make of it .
and which would you say she was the least interested in .
which toys ?
probably the stuffed animals .
most of the stuffed animals .
do you think she recognizes the names for any of these items .
maybe book .
but .
that would be probably it .
what about any of the food items ?
most of her food is still .
pureed .
so i mean i don't know that shh i mean she might recognize the word peas .
but i don't know if she would actually associate with that shape .
you know what i mean the shape of the food ?
other than that probably .
probably not maybe ice cream .
i don't know .
do you have any of these exact same toys at home ?
we had this book .
okay .
and good night moon .
but this is one two three a counting book so its i don't think this it's the same book .
it's not the same book .
and would you say she prefers like at home books over toys or toys over books ?
she's really she she really likes her books which is something relatively new .
but she also has like a tambourine and some maracas that she really likes so .
i'd say those two are .
stiff competition between the two .
it would be hard-pressed for me to say which one she favors more .
okay .
now the animals do you think she .
some kids have very early on teach them about animals and seem to recognize some of these animals .
she doesn't watch tv .
i doubt she recognizes any of these .
i tr we don't even really she has some stuffed animals but she doesn't really play with them .
the next visit will probably be in a month .
okay .
we'll give you a call .
you remember that ?
that's a completely new material for you .
i just don't think she's .
right you know .
okay maybe we shouldn't do that .
now that you have teeth that's probably not a good idea .
probably not stellar .
okay so in a month ?
no no problem .
that would be a good idea .
no .
not at all .
looks like we had some fun here !
she likes the food .
which is no surprise because she likes food in general .
she likes to eat ?
she loves to eat .
what kind of things was she was she into ?
shh the fo she loves the food .
like it really got her .
she really liked that .
because like she like stuffed animals .
she really didn't care too .
i mean she liked the bee's hair just because it's interesting .
you know the baby she liked the eyes and stuff but .
can i have my pen please ?
she wasn't nearly as interested in any of it as she was the food .
come here amelia .
amelia .
come here .
come get this .
were there any particular food items you thought she was like really into ?
she really liked the pizza .
she loved thi like yelling into this .
she likes making her voice sound different .
she she and her brother do that a lot .
she liked the icecream .
the where's the spaghetti ?
she liked the spaghetti before too i remember that .
and i think this bright red the contrast i do not know if she likes that this one .
icecream there she goes .
she likes the icecream .
did she like this one ?
she liked the waffle she was clapping the waffles together .
i thought it was interesting too she'd get two of the same and tr clap those together .
which i thought was interesting the pizza and .
and so .
you were reading a couple books to her ?
she likes books .
i mean she she loves karen katz she has a few of these .
she really likes that one .
course like rip the flaps up all the time .
but that it's you know but .
and she likes any of these with the animals that she can feel .
we have a bunch of these at home too so she's used to those .
does she know any animal sounds ?
she doesn't make any yet .
no .
nope not yet .
and she has this one at home too she likes that one too .
so she likes that .
but she don't can't recall her making any animal sounds yet .
no .
she rea no she doesn't yet .
because she just i mean just like a few months ago she just started talking like just saying the mama dada .
okay .
she'll parrot us .
but i don't think she makes any sen .
like if we say what does a cow say she doesn't know what to say yet at all .
so .
if like her brother says a noise she'll parrot it but she doesn't know what she's doing .
so .
she wasn't she gave it kisses but that was about it .
she wasn't as interested .
last time she really liked the baby .
she wasn't as interested this time .
which is interesting .
there she goes .
she wants to kiss it and chew on it .
i think she's teething on it actually .
okay .
so she likes baby real babies but she's not as she wasn't as interested .
i think because we don't have any of the food at home .
okay .
and we have tons of babies at home .
and i think that this just really is stimulating her because she doesn't see it and she likes it she really does so .
right in the mouth .
everything .
right in the mouth .
everything .
all day long .
what's this amelia ?
she's got the keys .
she she likes .
and this we feed her little peas so .
how can i eat that ?
she wasn't today .
no .
i mean just the bee with the hair .
even when i mean we have this winnie the pooh at home .
so i thought .
but she she didn't care .
she didn't care about the puppet at all .
which doesn't surprise me .
we have a puppet and she her brother loves like when we play with it and she doesn't care .
she's just like .
so .
but .
you .
she likes that game .
she loves clapping and dancing .
she's a little dancer .
do you ever do peekaboo with her ?
she does peekaboo .
it's more like when i'll hold her like shirt when we're changing her we play like then .
so she does peekaboo .
and she'll do pattycake if you play with her .
her coordination yet is still she's still having like trouble figuring out but she'll play .
she does this .
does it taste good ?
she likes to clap a lot .
and she just started clapping the two two toys together this past week .
she's a good eater .
she is !
and we're lucky .
because her brother's very fussy .
so it's like she's so easy and like it's going to be the situation where as they grow up he'll be li she'll be like you going to finish that ?
and he'll be like you can have it .
you know ?
because he just doesn't there are days where he just doesn't care to eat at all .
and does she do you have a i heard you mentioned a a dog .
do you have a dog at home ?
we don't .
but they're around dogs all the time .
because we live in a community where they're constantly walking dogs everywhere so we see dogs every day .
alright .
so they like dogs .
and my their grandparents and all their aunts and uncles have dogs .
so they're around dogs a lot it's just we don't have one .
okay .
our neighbor has a dog chico .
who's a little chihuahua .
so they see chico all the time he's always in the back yard .
i don't know where but the chihuahua wherever he went .
here he is .
looks just like without the pink collar .
looks like chico .
she says this isn't fair .
bottle .
bottle .
is that your bottle ?
pretty close .
she's trying .
second babies i think .
because her she just hears her brother talk all day long and she just say i mean she'll he'll say stuff and she'll just be like trying to say it too .
so i think that that really makes a difference .
it's good that she has someone to kinda chat with .
she likes the icecream .
she does .
alright well i think that we are done .
that's good ?
alright !
alright that should be good .
hi !
she's found one thing that she w .
that's okay !
okay so i just have a few questions to ask you .
okay .
okay .
which of the toys seemed to interest your child the most ?
i think after she felt the hair on that .
haha .
that became her new favorite .
i think the texture she likes of it .
which is a good toy for her personality ?
she tends to like her baby dolls at home .
she likes to give hugs and kisses and all that to her baby doll but .
a little bit smaller than this but .
that one's like the size of her .
so i think she's kind of .
not really sure .
okay .
more than just kind of hitting them .
she likes to make noises and stuff .
but active .
so she likes to do things .
right ?
so which of the toys seemed to interest her the least ?
stuffed animals don't .
i mean she just kind of likes to hug them .
and throw them throw them aside .
okay .
i think it's more because shh i think the last time i was saying she uses them more at night .
so i think she doesn't really .
see them as play time .
which book did she prefer to play with ?
she loves these kind .
i mean although i guess i kind of picked it out for her .
but looking at different ones she seemed to like this one the most .
she likes to do that .
with the flaps .
okay .
haha it looks like it .
good job .
is there any reason why ?
is it because of the flaps or ?
i guess we do i mean we have similar ones at home .
so i guess just from she's used to them .
and doing something with them .
turning the pages she likes to do a lot .
but especially with the flaps kind of adds something to it .
and the bottle .
you really wanted to feed yourself .
are you hungry ?
we're working on sippycups .
so i don't know if that kind of she thinks is a different kind of .
okay .
were there any items you think your child's never seen before ?
i guess maybe the .
but we don't have any at our house .
okay .
okay .
are there any kinds of food that .
she's seen that she's played with before ?
i think she just likes things that she can hold .
like the smaller ones that she can put in her hands .
that kind of bang together .
okay .
where are you going ?
so for all the toys do you have any favorite things at home ?
i mean i know you said that .
the book .
we do have keys .
the last time we were here she would not put these keys down .
we do have keys similar to this .
but she's not as attached .
lately .
as she was .
when she was younger .
haha what do you want ?
you want that now ?
okay .
where are you going ?
do you think your child prefers books or toys ?
i think different times of days .
i mean we read her a lot of books at night .
so at night she prefers books .
i think she's just used to routine .
but during the day .
she's at daycare during the day .
four days a week i think mainly toys and stuff .
i think it varies .
what's she in the mood for .
and baby dolls .
that's for everyone .
starting to do the whole baby doll thing lately .
where are you going ?
do you ever play with do you ever pretend to feed the dolls at home ?
we do at times with like her bottles .
and at times she'll try to stick the bottle towards their mouth .
don't eat the books .
she likes to eat everything right now .
and what does she like to do with the dolls other than try to feed them ?
mainly just hug them .
we have a little cradle that she'll put the baby in .
kind of rock it .
rock the bassinet .
with the baby in it .
and we have a little stroller that like pushes a baby doll .
and she'll put the baby doll in the stroller .
so i think she kind of .
acts it out .
what we do to her .
for the on the farm book has she seen any of the animals in the book before ?
and if so which ones ?
not seen in person .
but just through books .
the different animals .
she's seen dogs .
i don't know if there's a dog in there .
haha getting a little rough with the baby .
which of the toys seemed to interest her the most ?
she definitely likes things like this .
she can put in her mouth that make noise .
like that's she really really likes those .
so do you think those are good toys for her personality ?
definitely .
things that make noise ?
things that make noise .
things that move .
things that she can definitely explore with her mouth and her hands .
have there been any changes since the last visit in terms of toys or games ?
she loves these books like the peekaboo books .
anything that she can lift up and see .
like she loves those .
as you can tell like most stuff goes into her mouth so .
she likes these books more than like just the regular ones .
but the ones that you know she still likes them .
and she likes to turn the pages .
but these .
guys are like a new .
favorite .
so like before naptime we usually read .
some kind of book like this .
so she really really likes those .
and like the stuffed animals you know she kinda and dolls there's not a whole lot of interest in .
she takes them leaves them you know .
not as interested in those .
okay .
so which of the toys seemed to interest her the least .
probably the stuffed animal ones .
she was interested in the the doll though .
like that's that's new .
i mean we don't really have many .
dolls at home .
we have more of like the animal ones .
so this you know she was interested in .
she probably i don't know if she thought it was a little person or .
or not .
we have no idea .
maybe .
let's see .
do you remember what she played with at the last visit ?
she loved this thing .
she liked the bee .
and she played with a lot of like the food these things .
because i think at that point she was really kind of teething .
and she might still she might be getting ready for some more teeth .
so she played with the harder things a lot .
and she played with some of the books .
but again like this was the only kind of thing that interested her of all those .
this this stuff .
interesting stuff on top ?
which books did she prefer to read or look at with you beside the ones that .
i think the ones that have like either like the like the kinda like the touch and feel or the peekaboo ones versus the plain ones .
because i mean she'll i mean she still is interested but not as interested .
in them .
does she play with similar toys at home ?
i mean the these type of books .
she has lots of kind of blocks at home that she loves playing with .
i think these are kind of like the the blocks .
but we don't have any any dolls though .
that's the one thing we don't have at home that she seemed interested in .
there you go lilly .
you got it .
you got it .
so does she prefer books or toys in general ?
it depends .
i mean i think there's a time like if she if she can see the books then she'll want to go after them .
like if they're out .
but if she's just around her toys then she's kind of happy .
and if there's like both of them together .
i don't know .
i think like when she gets a little more kind of like tired like around naptime because of her routine then she kind of moves more toward books .
because she knows you know .
but if she's awake like this and pretty active then she probably wants to .
play with toys .
do you think she .
well she didn't really play with the food that much .
do you think she recognizes any of them ?
she might recognize the peas .
because she eats a lot of like .
i think she was trying to like pull them apart .
because she can you know now now she can pick up like whole peas and actually eat them now .
versus like the pureed stuff .
but no .
like the bread and the waffle i don't think she probably just thinks like a block .
you know .
are you trying to eat that ?
do you think there are any items that aren't here that she could recognize the names of ?
or any items that are here ?
li if like the you know the the little rings on that little tri the stacking rings .
i think she might .
you know we call them her rings or donuts .
and i bet she would go after those .
that's probably something she would recognize .
are those yummy ?
okay that's it .
that's it lilly !
we're all done !
can i ask you some questions now ?
sure .
can you tell me something about the play session today, about what you guys played with ?
mostly the food .
and he likes spoons and stuff that i give him in the kitchen .
so he's playing with like the measuring spoons and stuff like that .
he's really into throwing things .
no, no, no, no, no, no .
we're not going after camera .
i know .
laughing .
yah ?
that's the best remedies, we don't ever have to say no .
yah, he just kinda throws things around right now .
bangs things together .
sometimes he'll sit and listen to me read for a little bit .
no .
you're a quicky .
you are so quick .
come on over here .
let's look at the toys .
yah, look at these toys .
aren't they amazing ?
no ?
look at the toys .
so you were saying he likes he usually plays in the kitchen ?
in your kitchen .
yes, if i'm like cooking i'll usually give him some plastic spoons .
like serving spoons .
there's a, like a cabinet that he's allowed he can go into that has like the tupperware and stuff like that .
he just gets out and throws around .
he likes to bang .
right ?
do you ever put like sound effects ?
well sometimes i'll give him like a metal bowl .
and i'll have a wooden spoon so that's a lot louder .
then the plastic .
so he likes that .
or i'll put things like in a water bottle and give him like an empty water bottle so he can shake that .
yes, that the baby ?
you going to kiss the baby ?
give the baby a kiss .
no ?
no .
now we're done with the baby .
does he have any dolls at home ?
no, he has stuffed animals but he doesn't have any dolls .
is he exposed to other infants, or ?
at .
daycare he has but .
they're not younger than him .
he's the youngest .
he probably knows the word, right ?
or .
i mean he's heard it before cause my friend .
we were just recently around my friend who had a baby .
we were talking about baby .
that the baby ?
yah .
well, how about tell me about the food .
did he play with it today .
yes .
he definitely played with the food .
i think he liked, , the wooden toys just because they were heavier .
and then when he could bang things against it .
then everything goes in his mouth .
i mean he likes peas .
i don't know if he recognized the peas or not .
yah that's the baby .
you give the baby a kiss ?
you going to give kisses ?
woo .
that hurt ?
yah, give kisses .
that's funny .
yah, so he likes things he can kinda just toss around .
okay .
you think he'd recognize any of the names of the .
or they're familiar .
i don't know .
i don't know if we .
have you ever had waffles ?
you've had pancakes .
but i don't know if you've ever had waffles .
yah, i don't know if he'd really recognize any of the names .
well tell me about the food items he did tend to go for .
he was playing with the peas .
and, .
the waffle on his own .
and the pizza .
i introduced the burger .
mama .
which he started playing with .
i think the spaghetti too .
i might have introduced that, but he was playing with that .
and he got some of the plates .
and that's pretty much what .
he just throws things .
that's what he does at home .
you get the spoon ?
can you feed the baby ?
when it comes to the food, do you think he was attracted to the color or the texture or the names you were giving them ?
i think probably the color and maybe the texture .
he's like a big .
now that he's solid foods he's like a beggar .
so when he sees anyone eating food he wants real food .
you know .
so i don't know if cause it looks like real food it was more interesting to him .
he's like i won .
right .
where you going ?
you just walking now .
oo you going to sneak over there ?
come here .
come here .
yah, hurry .
yah .
oof .
our pants our long .
yah, oo, and we just got these shoes, and it's hard to walk in shoes .
how about the books ?
sometimes like when were playing he'll want me .
bring me a book and i'll read it and he'll sit and listen .
he didn't seem too interested .
this one he had seen in the waiting room and he likes all the touching feeling books .
okay .
did he like any particular animals, any feel for any animal or .
he really likes .
he always like the ducks .
i think he likes the pig feeling one too .
that's a different sound ?
do you have any of these books at home ?
no, i don't have of these .
we have things like that, but we don't have that one .
and we have board books, but they're not those .
do you ever play like patty cake or peekaboo ?
yes .
yah .
he'll play pattycake .
he'll do peekaboo .
trip, you want to play pattycake ?
or that's very exciting .
you play patty cake ?
yah ?
pattycake ?
so funny .
what are you doing ?
yah .
that's all very exciting .
can i pull your pants leg up ?
yah, there's another spoon, look it has monkeys .
it's there you go .
right, we're talking about the books .
yes .
was there anything different about how you played with the books or ?
the items in the books that were interesting .
not really .
i mean usually i'll see if we're sitting down and playing i'll see he wants me to read him a book or he'll bring one .
and then i read it as long as he looks like he's interested and then when he stops then i stop .
okay .
and how about the stuff animals ?
at home he plays with stuffed animals a little, you know .
a little bit .
but all of his are bigger .
so i don't know if it's like the size is different so then he wasn't just interested in them .
or we don't have any of the plastic foods .
that might have been more exciting .
where as we have, , stuffed animals .
we don't have any puppets .
and he really liked the puppet .
and there's not really anything that .
like this dog doesn't look like our pet dog .
but he did like he liked this one .
i don't know if it's the pink , necklace thing .
were there are there familiar animals in here as far as their names, or ?
the goose might be familiar because when we go on our walks we always see canadian geese .
so i talk about those while we're when he's in the stroller and we're walking around .
but he didn't seem to really recognize it .
any of the farm animals ?
he's been around horses .
and that's about it .
of the animals .
what were his favorite the if you hadta pick the animals that he liked to play with the most today .
which ones were those ?
well he liked the kangaroo puppet .
and then i'm did he touch any other .
trip come here .
what are you doing ?
yah, i don't know if he played with any others really .
were there ones that you tried to get him interested, or thought he would be interested in ?
yah .
like the dog i thought, he didn't really care about that .
i set up the groundhog for him .
he did touch it, but he didn't really do anything with it .
he threw the fox .
that was set up .
i gave to him .
come here, your pants .
yah, but other than that he didn't really play with any of the other stuffed animals .
okay .
did you guys play with the magnets ?
yes .
yes .
was that new ?
yah, these were new .
or i don't remember them last time .
but he didn't seem to be really i mean he touched the head .
and i was trying to show him that they come together, but he didn't really seem to notice that too much .
okay .
what do you think was his favorite thing here today ?
probably the spoons and banging things on the peanut butter jar .
he liked that .
he liked the plates .
and putting the he was playing with the spaghetti and the peas .
he probably played with the peas the most .
yah .
what do you think was his least favorite thing ?
least favorite .
i guess probably this little stuffed dog .
he didn't really seem to care about one of those .
trying to get him to play .
or he wasn't really interested in the peekaboo book at all .
is that fun ?
was there anything here today that you thought he would really enjoy playing with and he didn't ?
that's a good question .
not really .
well i did think he would like this book more .
just cause we do have something like this where you have to lift things and he'll do that .
he didn't seem interested in this one .
so yah, i guess that would be what i thought he would enjoy more .
and was there any toy in here that you thought that you knew he was going to be drawn to and he was drawn to ?
that kind of fits his personality .
the plastic spoons .
cause he plays with those so much at home .
and that's because of the noise ?
yah, he just likes to bang it on everything .
is he putting a lot does he put things in his mouth .
not as much as he used to .
he still does .
but not as much as he used to .
yah, we like to put everything in our mouth, ?
what kind of foods is he eating at home ?
he eats pretty much anything we eat .
the only thing he can't have is bananas .
but other than that .
you know i just cut it up small and he eats anything really .
is that your bottle ?
has he already gotten like the treats, like the normals like kids treats .
yah .
that your ?
yah so he's pretty much had anything .
everything .
so that may have been why he was enjoying some of the food .
right .
some of the, you know, kids food .
not the kids food, but you know .
right .
real food .
he has had like he'll my husband will always get ice cream and he'll have some of his .
yah, can i get the sippy cup ?
i don't think it works .
he's really trying .
yah .
i don't think there's anything in there buddy .
you okay ?
alright, well i think that's it for today .
okay .
i think we talked about everything that you played with .
was there anything that we didn't talk about .
i don't think so .
you're just happy to be here .
you okay ?
you're okay .
just a couple things that she played with i could ask you .
it looked like she did a lot of playing with the kitchen stuff like the food and stuff .
she's still she's still real oral .
she still puts everything in her mouth .
and pretty much p like plastic toys is is what she goes for .
does she have anything like that at home or does your other daughter .
so this is a little bit familiar .
definitely the plates the utensils and the pretend food .
okay so does she have any of these actual food items like pizza ?
not specifically .
no i think we mi we have a spaghetti that looks just like that .
but that's about it .
no cookies .
no cookies no waffles ?
no no .
sandwich ?
no no sandwich at home .
no she's not really familiar with sandwich .
we do have the peas .
and how about a bottle ?
we do have some bottles .
but they don't look anything like that .
haha no .
and she doesn't even take a bottle .
haha but she sees them a lot .
she knows what they're for ?
because we babysit another baby .
and that baby takes bottles .
right .
so do you think that .
knows cookies .
would be playing with this if if libby wasn't playing with that stuff .
she likes this on her own .
sort of thing ?
i would think so .
and is it because of her personality or just the stage she's at do you think ?
i sort of think it's like her her stage .
i think i think she still really likes to put stuff in her mouth still .
and that's the the most .
she also has three teeth currently coming in on the top .
so i think .
you think the fact that it's hard ?
i think it's it's it's both exploratory and .
it feels good .
thank you !
you have a bottle for me ?
thank you !
books are actually ha still hard for her because she doesn't she doesn't care to sit still for too long .
like i ha if if i'm going to read to her it hasta be before she goes to sleep .
and she's kind of you know .
slowed down enough .
and then like s even stuffed animals she's not so big with .
my other daughter was real like nurturing even by this age .
like she would hold it .
and she does that very rarely .
she didn't really even go for that stuff did she ?
right ?
did she like the the winnie the pooh ?
i think she was kind of neutral .
okay so those maybe least .
and .
the books .
not really because she's so active ?
and she's really famil .
i i'm alway i tr try to kind of shove books down their throat a lot i think .
so she doesn't .
really care .
she's rather do what she wants to do .
do you so would you say that she prefers toys over books then ?
yes definitely .
and besides these things that you said you have at home do you have any any of these actual same books at home or stuffed animals or baby dolls ?
we have .
like similar books to this with the with the sensory things in them .
but not none of these titles no .
and it looked like you were doing some animal things is she interested in that animals and their sounds ?
she like she's really responsive to music and singing .
she she will like kind of dance every time music starts .
or if you're singing and she'll s she'll try to sing .
right you love singing ?
haha .
do you think she knows any of the animals or their sounds ?
no i don i don i don't think she knows to like match them .
i know she .
recognizes them as something familiar .
i don't know if she would identify yet no .
and you but you say animal sounds as well like when you .
play a lot .
let's see do you think her interests have changed since the last time she was here a couple months ago ?
i think she's definitely more interactive .
with with playing .
she's got a rip .
i think she's definitely more interactive with with me when she plays .
last time she was here i know .
i felt funny because i felt like i haven't been playing with her that much .
but she was like so .
into like exploring on her own .
and i remember when she was a couple months younger like she she could just hang out and play for an hour on her own .
just picking stuff up putting it down whatever .
and now she definitely wa .
i mean she'll still do that clearly .
but she likes to play with my husband and i a lot too .
it seemed like she was doing that she was really interested .
you played some little games with her like put the cookie in and take it out .
which hand has the cookie and .
she seemed to like that .
she definitely she definitely looks for interaction now .
if her sister is not around she'll play by herself .
but as the minute her sister's in she goes to where she is .
you know and it's a problem .
haha but she always wants to be where she is .
playing with her toys and and bugging her .
i'm just curious does she sort of try to interact with libby or does she just want to have .
she kind of just wants to have whatever she has .
and i think she .
i don't know if she knows but .
she probably notices there's different toys out .
like libby is allowed to play with different toys than she is .
she's not allowed to have the crayons .
she's not allowed to have the small .
pieces .
so so a lot of times when those things are are novel she goes for them .
and she is definitely when i was here last time she was not resistant .
like if i took a toy away she wouldn't really care .
now she'll scream at me if i take something away that she's really into .
interesting so she's changed a lot .
let's see does she play with dolls at all ?
a very little bit and just starting .
like the other she got a baby doll for christmas .
that she seems to know is hers .
and she's carried that around a bit .
and she has a stroller that she pushes .
but her absolute fa her absolute favorite at home is this little rideon car that we have in that we have .
and she puts herself in it all day long .
and kind of yells waiting to be pushed .
so that's new .
you know she knows she needs somebody to push her .
she's communicating that .
caroline .
you're just amazing .
let's see .
so that's different from last time .
was she eight months when we were here last time ?
or six ?
she was we try to get get children between six and a half and seven and a half .
for the first visit .
seven months a little before a little after .
peekaboo !
she probably wasn't standing up then .
well i i know it was hard for her she was in a bumbo .
and i know that was weird for for her .
because she was definitely crawling by then .
peekaboo do you want to play peekaboo ?
you can play with that peekaboo !
does she like that game ?
yes she play she'll play on her on her own like whip her head around .
peekaboo !
what if just knowing her personality what sort of toys do you think sort of are her .
musical ones .
shh i think she i think she understands cause and effect .
like i think if there's when there's t we have this big t this big cube toy that when you hit it it sings a song .
and she definitely knows to hit it to get the .
music .
and then she'll dance to it .
so that's definitely those are definitely her her faves .
so interesting .
is that peekaboo ?
well i think that's all i needta ask at this point .
is it okay if i ask you some questions ?
so what do you think that hailey liked the most ?
probably the waffle or the icecream cone .
why do you think that she liked those ?
just because she probably is .
or the spoons .
i do not know she just spends a lot of time spent a lot of time playing with those toys .
hailey !
hailey .
that's not really a toy .
here honey .
always happens right about the end .
she's like mommy's not paying attention to me i'm going to grab something else .
keys .
are they stuff that she eats ?
the waffles and ?
no .
she eats like little itty bitty finger food so none of it resembles things here .
so she's not that familiar with them .
i mean she's more familiar with spoons but .
does she have do you think that she knows any of the names of the some of the foods that you played with today ?
probably not .
because she doesn't ever see it like this .
maybe like that because she has pasta but .
spaghettio .
we'll get you cleaned up .
we'll get you cleaned up .
i heard some gurgles .
no wonder !
no wonder hailey .
ew .
party in there .
alright kiddo .
clean .
what were what was something that she didn't like to play with ?
she really wasn't interested in any of the stuffed toys except for this .
she was really interested in that but .
she doesn't play with stuffed toys very much .
even though we offer them at home .
she doesn't really play with them .
so it's pretty much similar to here .
do you do you think she knows or is familiar with the animal names ?
do you talk about animal names ?
we do now .
in books mainly .
we i mean she probably doesn't know all of them .
like that we of through in her books but .
she probably knows dog cat because we have them at home .
but .
probably .
i think she recognized it like she understands bee .
she knows what a bee is .
but other than that i don't think so .
okay .
not yet .
did she like playing with the doll ?
i was surprised she didn't seem interested in it at first but she kept on going back to it .
albeit very roughly .
she she went back to it so i was surprised .
i had never seen her with the doll so .
we don't have any of those at home for her yet .
so i was surprised to see that she was interested .
what kinds of things were was she doing with it ?
well very roughly patting it's head .
and playing with the baby's arms but .
mainly just patting .
were you trying to get her to play with it in any particular way ?
i i tried to .
i guess i tried to bring her closer to the doll .
and i talked about it .
and i guess i just when she like engaged with it i sort of encouraged it but i didn't like try to push it on her after i saw that she wasn't really interested in the beginning so .
how about books .
she .
up until now unless it's a touch and feel book she pretty much just besides a few books that we have at home she doesn't she mainly listen like i just read it to her as she's playing .
she doesn't really listen to books yet .
so we s but there are a few books that we have at home that she's she's mainly for the tactile .
so .
so she's into more like the tou the feeling .
if it has that sort of thing then she's engaged but if it's just .
like a flat book she doesn't seem interested .
how about in general what do you think she likes most about her toys ?
do you think it's like texture color noise ?
probably noise .
we have a lot of toys with noise in them .
and tactile .
i think .
but .
probably those two .
what do you think in here kind of fits into that into those categories for her .
probably tactile because she was playing with the food toys mainly and she was like putting it into her mouth and manipulating it so .
probably the the play food .
so .
like none of it makes noise so .
she would definitely have been engaged with something with noise .
but mainly the the play food .
okay .
does she is she using spoons ?
we let her try to use a spoon at home .
it doesn't really work yet .
she's just beginning .
for right now .
has she and then is she is she eating more solid foods ?
are any of them in here ?
she has like pieces of bread and she'll have pieces of pasta and pieces of cheese .
but no we never just give her like the whole piece .
so .
right .
you smiling ?
what you doing over there ?
and so you don't ever play with she's not really into stuffed animals at home ?
she'll play with them but like minimally .
she'll pl she'll touch it pick it up look at it and then put it down .
so .
figure out what it is and then leave it alone ?
pretty much .
if it doesn't make noise or like feel or react .
she's not as interested .
she's not as engaged .
hailey that's not a toy i'm sorry honey .
that's not a toy .
here let's play with the waffle and spoon over here .
come here .
here .
come here baby .
i know i know it's not as f .
but i want to play with that .
i want to play with that .
she's nice .
pat the baby .
pat the baby .
your tummy .
so we don't i mean we don't have most of these toys at home besides the books but .
she clearly likes the spoons .
she does play with wooden spoons .
big wooden spoons .
that's not a toy either .
lots of .
like she has a lot of interactive toys .
but then she'll also just sit there and play with a spoon or she'll .
i guess she has a lot of .
no !
is she in that phase now where she's gagging herself ?
i think so .
so i mean i guess we just have a lot of we have a lot of different textures and shapes and .
she's really more into the things that like she's really more into her walking toy now .
okay .
so she's a really active kid .
so i mean as you can probably tell .
so she's mov she moves around a lot .
active activ active things .
overall .
okay .
where are you going ?
yes .
that's not going to be stable .
okay ?
here .
okay well i think that's all the questions i had .
okay .
unless you have anything else you wanted to add .
about her playing at home or here .
you're going to go back .
she's very single minded .
that's another thing that she's doing now .
she gets something into her head and .
she sticks with it .
yes .
she's rocking her own chair .
hailey .
you're going to do a face plant .
i don't want that to happen to you .
you will cry .
and hurt yourself .
i know i'm sorry i'm such a meanie !
what is that ?
hailey .
alright well we'll stop so then she can .
what's going on ?
my goodness !
my goodness !
you're welcome .
sure .
i just have a few quick .
sure .
questions for you .
which of the toys seem to interest him the most ?
and which is a good toy for his personality do you think ?
that's an interesting question .
like why do you think certain things interest him ?
i think the baby was certainly interesting to him because of the face .
and he loves to see babies faces in books .
and in magazines .
and in like real babies that's definitely interesting and it's kind of like you know a real baby .
and definitely a sippycup and the bottle .
because he's a big eater and big drinker .
so we don't actually have we have books .
but we don't really have a lot of we don't we don't have any play food .
i mean we have some stuffed animals .
and which of the toys seem to interest him the least and why do you think so ?
i think he was not interested in the book not because he doesn't like books more but because there was better interest and more interesting things to play with .
so i think there was more of a like a time just a particular time allotted and a lack of interest .
and do you think there are any items he recognizes the name of ?
and were there any items that you think he's never seen or heard before name of them ?
he's never heard the word fawn i'm sure .
deer maybe for that matter .
but certainly sippycup .
and bottle .
and plate .
and keys .
and cookies .
measuring spoons .
book .
icecream i'm not sure about icecream cones .
books .
baby .
keys .
spaghetti .
okay quite a few .
and do well you already answered this one do you ever play with pretend food not really .
do you ever play with pretend dolls at home ?
he has there's a doll at home .
that that he's played with well that we've seen .
he's had interaction with .
okay and was there a particular book if any of them that you think he particularly was interested in .
like with the way that you are feeling .
definitely he would he would definitely like this book .
well we we have a very similar peekaboo a baby turn cast book it's not this one but and .
so books with babies books with things to touch in .
things to lift up he likes those kinds of things .
i haven't really done too much doctor seuss with him .
that's all i have for you yup .
and she did she give you a toy ?
and everything okay great .
okay .
okay i can't quite remember what she liked during the first visit .
but what do you think she liked most during this one ?
shh she definitely liked seemed to like the pretend food .
haha she definitely seemed to enjoy that .
and i think she really liked she likes this box of cornflakes .
haha she has .
not quite sure what she sees in that .
i was going to ask you what do you think she likes about that ?
i don't know .
what do you like about that ?
i don't know what's so appealing about that .
haha .
i wonder she gets very excited when she sees the yellow box of cheerios .
i wonder if that reminds her of the cheerio box .
very interesting .
that's funny .
it could have the effect ?
maybe .
maybe it kinda .
it's .
it's the same yellow a yellow cereal box .
maybe she's thinking about cheerios .
and she like she seemed to like the spaghetti too just holding it and feeling the texture .
bumpy .
and she what else did she play with ?
she played with these a little bit .
she kinda shook them .
do you shake these ?
shaky shakys ?
do you like those ?
i think so .
they move and make noise ?
do you ever give her real keys to play with ?
i don't i haven't given her like my real keys .
we've got a few different sets of plastic ones at home .
but she's seen something like that before .
how about this kind of stuff ?
do you have this at home ?
we do .
we have some .
because you have older kids .
we have a play kitchen .
and it's got some pretend food in it .
mostly we have like more dishes and pots and pans and stuff .
my girls like to cook invisible food .
they just .
haha .
so does she ever play .
but we do have we do have some of these cookies and stuff .
she she does play with some of these things at home .
i mean that's what and .
so she might be looking for things that are a little familiar .
she didn't seem to like this container too much .
how does she do with books at home ?
does she like that sort of thing yet ?
she she's not really that interested in in being read to .
she likes to kinda move around and and explore the room more so than sitting and being read to .
so that might not be her thing .
does she have any .
unfortunately i don't get a lot of one-on-one time with her .
and it seems like whenever i do sit down to read her sisters kinda push her out of the way .
so which makes me sad .
so that that might be why she's a little bit more like off on her own doing things .
maybe it's her personality too .
it could be a little bit .
you know we'll keep offering these things when you come back for visits .
and it'll be interesting to see .
does she have any baby dolls at home ?
haha she doesn't have any of her own .
she has a teddy bear .
we have we have some baby dolls at home .
we have about probably at least six or seven of them .
we have quite a few .
they float around .
she's got her her stuffed animals .
she's got her little teddy bear that she loves .
and .
but you didn't see one of those today ?
no teddy ?
did she like any of those animals over there ?
she didn't seem to be that interested in any of them .
kind of just gave them a passing she liked this one best i think .
she liked that one best .
does she do animals sounds ?
is that what she liked ?
she doesn't do we do sa we do some .
saw you doing with the puppy like woof woof .
ellie .
ellie .
you're just a star .
i think she wants to be on .
she wants to haha .
ellie where you going ?
so she liked that for a second .
hi there !
especially when you did that ribbit thing i think she liked .
she liked that .
does she recognize that do you think ?
s sometimes .
a little bit .
maybe it was just a funny sound .
is it going to stay up ?
hi !
haha pink puppy .
pink baby !
are you a little pink baby today ?
she found th did she find this on her own ?
she did ?
she did .
you have this kind of thing at home ?
we have we have some .
she doesn't drink from a cup a lot .
but she does a little sometimes .
like a regular cup or a sippy cup ?
both .
sometimes i'll hold up a regular cup for her to drink from .
and sometimes she drinks from a sippy cup .
but she's .
that looks a little bit familiar ?
this one's just pretend .
let's see if there an .
she's certainly seen sippy cups around the house for sure .
so would you say that these kinds of toys at least as far as what we're offering here are sor suit her personality the best ?
what she's interested in ?
i think so .
so she's kind of active and .
maybe it reminds you of .
she likes to hold hold different things .
it could be that i mean that's the right size for her hand too .
you found something else .
what did you find ?
some pizza ?
you haven't tried any pizza yet .
i'm not sure if i asked you this already .
do you do you think there are any of these toys or objects that she knows the name of ?
i don't think so .
that doesn't look that real .
some of them do like that one's a little more real .
or how about that ?
would she know the name of that ?
i don't think so .
she hasn't really been exposed to icecream .
there's plenty of time for that .
haha she's sort of still just starting on you know finger foods and stuff .
so she doesn't really know a lot .
lot of different kinds ?
of food names .
how about cheerios ?
do you know that name ?
haha she looked right at the box !
you know cheerios don't you ?
haha .
you know that one !
you know some words .
okay and which type of toy do you think was least interesting to her ?
she seemed to be least interested in the doll .
in the doll ?
she didn't really even glance at that .
took a passing glance into this box and looked at th the one book a little .
for a second .
you didn't really do anything with that dolly .
i wonder what will happen next time .
i think i did i miss anything ?
i think that's good okay .
i'm going to go ahead and ask you some questions now .
okay .
sounds like she was busy .
she's a busy little girl .
what did she like playing with this time ?
the stuffed animals and the food .
did she do you think she had any favorites ?
the spoon .
i actually don't know where it gotta .
there it is .
she loves spoons for some reason .
she likes to hold them .
but really .
i mean anything she can get her hands on .
does she have stuffed animals at home ?
we have them but she doesn't .
usually play with them so much .
so today she did .
like them .
i know you can't eat that either .
which of the animals did you show her ?
we did .
we pretty much did all of them .
the kangaroo .
their friend the deer .
the fox .
the zebra .
the otter i guess .
it says seaweed so i'm assuming it's an otter .
otter .
the frog and i think the goose .
she kinda went with the bee .
and the chicken a little bit .
and the donkey over here .
she just kinda .
touched it .
but .
it is kinda gross .
now that i look really closely at .
it .
it picks up everything unfortunately .
i mean it's interesting hair but .
yes .
yes .
not very clean hair .
we tried to clean it many times .
it just doesn't .
it just makes it gummier .
like wetness makes it .
i wonder if like wiping it down with like rubbing alcohol or something .
that might clean it and stop the gumminess .
good idea we'll try that .
we've tried many things .
but we haven't tried that .
that's a good idea .
cause .
how about the food items did she like any of those ?
the pizza .
slices and now she's got the spaghetti .
she's got a we've got a tea set at home and some like fruits and vegetables .
fake food and they she loves playing with them .
okay .
she tries to eat them too .
so she's in the mood for spaghetti .
yes .
or pizza .
and that's cool cause we're having spaghetti tonight .
so it works out well if you can wait that long right ?
do you think she recognizes .
any of these items ?
i think the pizza she does .
okay .
she loves pizza .
my .
husband does too .
and does she eat peas ?
she we just started with peas and she likes them .
so i'm not quite sure if she recognizes them or she just though that's kinda funky looking .
but .
she's sorta putting them on the plate .
she is .
is that where food goes ?
and forks i mean spoons ?
she's trying to use spoon to dish this .
ha spoons too slow .
and then did you guys look at any books ?
she did not .
no books today .
and i was surprised she didn't even look glance at the doll .
cause she loves dolls but not today .
she does .
loves dolls .
so you must have those at home ?
we do .
okay .
we have many dolls that are supposed to be hers and that .
don't really get to be played with too much .
but .
okay .
because big sister takes them but she loves them .
and how is she with books at home ?
any interest ?
she likes books .
she likes to eat them .
they taste good apparently .
she'll kinda listen if i'm telling if i'm reading a story to my other daughter she'll kinda listen in .
but she's really she don't she doesn't want to sit down and listen yet .
okay .
but she likes to pretend she likes to take my books .
i'm a big reader and she likes to take my books and open them and look at the pages .
yes .
thank you .
thank you .
i didn't eat it fast enough .
i am .
i going to get this one ?
giving it to the otter .
thank you .
so today you would say she did not she was not interested in the baby or the books ?
yep .
a little bit with the food ?
some what .
select items of the food .
okay .
and do you remember .
when she was here for the first visit how she played or what she was interested in and .
whether it was different today ?
well she went for the food .
and i think i .
kept .
throwing in the stuff .
she liked this thing .
okay .
i remember that .
but and the stuffed animals she was kinda like their cool alright fine mom but .
she was mostly she kinda just at first she kinda went .
what do i do and .
she played with the dolly .
that they had .
okay so .
where you going ?
a little different today .
because it's been a while that since .
you were here right ?
so she's changed a lot .
almost .
almost four months .
so .
she's almost eleven months now .
so august something .
so .
so it seems like she may have changed a lot .
back then she used to just let jackie take her she just kinda sat there now she fights back and .
alright .
she's got toys she likes to play with .
are there any toys that she plays with she really likes at home that we don't have here ?
she likes things that she can push like wheeled things that .
especially ones that are big enough that she can walk them .
she's .
she's .
we went from taking a step .
to two steps to five steps in a matter of days .
so she's really wanting to walk .
and so things that .
we have a wagon at home that she likes to push .
she like she loads it up with her dolls and .
any stuffed animals that are lying about .
and then pushes it around the house .
so .
okay .
well she's .
but .
at that stage .
so .
she was definitely up on her feet .
i saw that .
she's definitely it's it's the second child syndrome .
right .
it's keeping up with the .
big sister .
better warn your daughter .
she's already figured it out .
she's like mommy then can come after me now .
i know .
well i don't have anything else to ask .
okay .
unless you have anything to to add to it .
we'll see you back very shortly .
she .
may or may not change in .
her interests .
that's one of the things that's interesting .
just to see if she plays differently or .
right .
if she's interested in something else .
so we'll see but .
okay .
it will be the same set of things .
okay .
and like i said .
hopefully this time we'll make it through the .
she'll make it through the .
i will give you back this .
are you showing off over there ?
now i'm going to ask you some questions .
okay .
you did a good job .
alright so what was the first thing that he went to ?
first toy do you remember ?
i showed him the bee .
i don't know what he went to on his own .
probably the keys .
or no actually the book i'm sorry .
does he play with so he went to the the bee that was like put together like that ?
does he have any stuffed animals at home ?
he was some but i keep a lot of them put up because they're like little stuff attached to them like his brother has .
so i don't have a lot of the stuffed animals out just a couple .
so he doesn't really play with those that much right now .
so why do you think he wanted to pick up that first ?
this one ?
probably because it's different .
he probably doesn't see much something like this that often .
and anything sticking up attracts him .
you know the little antennas or the wings .
you kicked your shoe off and your sock .
so so he liked he went to that bee and then he looked at the keys .
does he have have this at home ?
he has them on a ring .
like the baby keys .
so that was familiar to him .
because they're not on a ring like that it's they're just by themselves .
right but they they're shaped similar to this .
so it's probably why he they look familiar .
and he also has the teethers that look similar to that so maybe that's why he .
so and you said he also looked in the book .
does he have that one at home ?
we have one similar .
the goodnight moon without the counting .
so we we have it looks almost exactly like that from the front .
so big .
do you have a lot of books at home ?
yes .
is that something he .
we read every night before we go to bed .
him and his brother and i .
we read .
he didn't really play with many of the stuffed animals i hadta introduce them to him .
i showed him the clock and he kinda waved that around but he didn't really go to any of the food items at all .
we have them at home so i don't know if maybe that's why .
because he's seen them before .
because his brother has some of this stuff now .
so i can't think of anything .
he didn't look at anything over here at all .
usually at this age they are all over this stuff like on their mouths and everything .
he put the well i i showed him the icecreams and he put them in his mouth .
but i hadta show him he's very concentrated when he plays he doesn't wander a lot .
so it's funny he'll stick on the same thing for quite a while and we have a lot of toys in our play room .
so he's very content with one or two things a lot of times .
it looks like he likes that bee .
it's really cool isn't it ?
so you don't do you have anything like that at home ?
similar .
we do have some like like a pizza at home .
and bread .
and he does play with the spoon a lot at home .
so these should be familiar to him and we also go to the library where they have a fantasy area where he can play with this kind of stuff .
and we were actually there today looking at like in a kitchen area .
so he's he's familiar with these items .
here you go .
so do you think maybe he likes to play with that because he doesn't have ?
i think maybe because and they're anything that like looks that sticks out he tends to draw his attention .
that he can play with with his fingers .
he's very fascinated with touching things .
so he likes to you know check things out a lot .
like he'll crawl across the room for a speck of leaf on the carpet .
yes he is .
don't put it in your mouth .
so do you remember the last visit when you did this same type of thing ?
yes .
are there any changes ?
he's definitely a lot more interested in new things .
i think before he was still a little younger .
and i in the last couple months he's definitely blossomed a lot more .
now that he can crawl he's out he'll he'll explore a lot more so i think he definitely tries more than he did before .
you playing peekaboo ?
don't put it in your mouth .
good job .
so you would say that this time he looked at a lot more than he did .
i think so .
because last time i i hadta really initiate it a lot more .
and so i think this time he .
even though i'd initiate some this time he was a lot more interested on his own and try to crawl up and play with things that he wouldn't have before .
and what about the doll ?
that was not really ?
doesn't interest him .
it didn't this time at all .
i do not know it's because we don't have them at home .
he has a brother you said ?
and he i mean he goes over to somebody's house to play that's a girl but i don't know if they even play with it there that much .
you're so big .
you're so into you're so big ?
so what do you think .
you said you read to him every night .
what do you think he prefers books or toys ?
he likes the reading the books or ?
i i think it's probably about the same but i think in general he seemed to like the toys a little more .
and do you think at this point as opposed to different from last time that he recognizes the names of some of these items more ?
like some of the animals ?
he may .
i haven't really sat down with him lately and and had a lot of one-on-one time with him .
so that's probably not as good as it could be .
potty training his brother has been a been a new priority lately so .
so they're close in age ?
his brother's three .
and he's ten months so they're just a little over two years apart .
okay .
so do you think that there's anything else that you just noticed about this play session that you might want to add that anything that was like maybe surprised you about what he liked to look at or what he wasn't interested in ?
no this is pretty much the same type of toys he would see generally .
it every day it changes with him so i can't think of anything special or different or anything .
okay .
let's see .
i'll start asking some questions .
okay .
i was trying to get her to talk because she does normally talk a lot .
where's all your babbling ?
where's all your babbling ?
alright so what do you think she liked the most ?
definitely these .
okay .
definitely these ?
that and the food .
she likes the food still .
how do you think she liked those so much ?
i don't know because she can put them in her mouth .
probably we have a lot of this stuff at home too .
kitchenny stuff just like last time she didn't gravitate towards the .
stuffed animals other than .
she was fascinated by the tag in this one at first .
but other than that didn't want to play with these too much .
i tried showing her a couple of them but .
we didn't want to play with animals too much did we ?
she liked all the plastic stuff she put a couple of them in her mouth .
but we have .
not it's not actual measuring spoons but she has a little a baby one that has like three spoons on it and it's the one in my diaper bag and it's definitely one of her favorite things i don't know if it's the noise or ?
definitely one of her favorite toys that i don't go without .
it's so funny .
and she she ate she ate a couple of the your icecream cones she did put in her mouth and her and the peas .
because i know you guys like to wipe this stuff down and the bottle she fed herself the bottle .
and the cup .
and we fed the baby .
that's her new word just like in the last week she started saying that baby .
baby .
i can hear it clearly .
it's so funny .
i mean sometimes she'll stand up in front of the mirror baby .
that's cute .
baby .
you're the baby .
baby .
because see we have a lot of baby dolls at home but her older sister my older one's not .
real into that stuff .
she's more of a dress up and dance than the kitchenny stuff so i don't she doesn't see the older one do it as much so it didn't seem to i thought i just assumed you know she'd follow the older one you know that's why this stuff is all over my house all the time .
so i don't know if she plays with that because that's what she kinda knows from our kitchen or what .
i'm hoping she'll be a like a mommy girl .
my older one's not real into that .
do you try to you know play with the baby in a way that's .
yes baby .
in a way that's very similar to how you would normally act with a baby to show her ?
that's what i was trying to do with her let's feed the baby and we put the baby's sock and try to get the shoe on .
so that's what i was trying to do was play with her you know like we would take care of the baby i don't know if i did a good job but .
we tried .
what do you have allison ?
do you have peas ?
so what was her favorite toy last time if you could remember ?
baby .
i think it was something in this stuff too i don't remember if these were actually here i remember the keys .
was it all the same stuff ?
it was ?
i don't remember i think it was this stuff too .
the noise makers and the food the plastic food last time she was really hooked on these .
the waffles i remember that .
i don't know if it was the texture you know ?
this time it was the peas she kept picking up the peas or .
the icecreams but i also showed her the icecream and she loves to eat the icecream .
right .
i pointed that out to her .
i pointed out the pizza to her but she didn't pay too much attention to that .
do you think she recognizes some of the food ?
as the play food that you have at home ?
she might we have icecreams at home i think as play the play food not as the real food .
i don't think she was quite making the connection that this is like i don't know i don't think she's quite there yet that she eats real icecream too i don't think she got that .
i tried .
but i don't think that was .
what about these items do you think she recognized these ?
the bottle definitely .
i think cause she instantly put it in her mouth .
so i think she was doing with it like she does her bottle .
and the cup too because i've been working with her on her sippycup so she automatically went and put that in her mouth too so i think those she did you know think they were like hers .
that tends to happen .
so do you have a lot of toys at home that make a lot of noise that maybe .
probably .
she likes the ones that make noise that that have lights and singing .
she loves anything with music .
you the baby ?
you see the baby ?
baby .
baby baby .
baby that's good .
see now see that's the first time i've ever really seen her like label it like correctly i didn't know if she really knew she was the baby or she just likes to say baby you know i don't know .
that's what's fascinating about them .
no no we're not playing with that .
we went for that one time .
i guess they make so much nowadays with all the lights and the movement and .
we do have a lot of those types of things and she loves that stuff she'll stand up and dance .
you want to show her dancing baby ?
show her dancing baby .
there's dancing baby !
there's dancing baby !
you dancing ?
show me dancing baby !
let me see you dance again !
dancing baby .
do dancing baby .
not on command she does it better when she's holding on to something because the standing thing we're a little unsturdy on .
but we have those things that you put on the fridge you know and you hit them and they play the music and you know .
i know .
so we have the animal ones those leapfrogs and then we have one of the one the older one has the letters so she loves those things she'll hit those things constantly and stand there and .
dance .
very cute .
baby .
did you have a lot of stuffed animals at home or ?
not a ton and you know what they're kind of from we have the older one has a lot she not as many and they're in kind of in this canvasy thing and my older daughter doesn't play with them much so they don't come out much .
so they just kinda stay in there so they're not all over the house .
definitely not .
maybe that's why .
she's not really into them .
there's a couple in her bed you know she has a couple special ones that are hers in her bed but .
that's what she wants under her face .
are you showing off ?
you're so happy !
you showing how you can stand ?
say i want to walk !
so what about the books which one do you think ?
she liked the peekaboo one .
and we got through a couple pages of the good night moon one last time i remember reading her this one the touchy one and she wasn't into feeling it i was making her feel the stuff but she didn't really i don't think it did anything for her i didn't try it again this time though .
but she liked the peekaboo book and that's when she was saying baby a lot .
so i she was kinda making that connection too there you know of the baby because she won't that's why when you guys asked about the peekaboo thing she plays it a little but like she loves it when we play it but she's not really doing it herself yet she's not actually doing peekaboo herself .
got you .
so that's why i said a little .
like she likes to play it in terms of like mommy and daddy or someone else does it and i laugh but she doesn't totally do it on her own yet .
right .
not quite .
say not quite .
so is there anything else you think we should know about her language or what she plays with or anything like that ?
trying to think .
i don't think so .
not that i can think of .
most of the stuff is like you know buttons she likes any she likes like a piano we have this musical piano thing .
and she likes hitting things on that and it's lights and music of course too .
so i guess she does kinda like that kinda stuff .
you're the baby .
baby .
you're going to have to pull more of those babies out for her to play with .
i guess so .
now those are kind of all over because we have like the stroller and we have the shopping cart and we do have those kinda things so .
then i'm wondering if like if she starts playing with them if the older one will then play with them more it'll be interesting to see .
yup .
because i have a niece that's in between these two and she's really into the babies and into changing them and all that baby baby stuff much more so than my older daughter so i'm wondering if this one will be like that you know ?
it's so funny because that's what i hadta get her for her birthday she wanted clothes for her babydoll whereas my daughter was like nah i don't need anymore clothes for the baby you know ?
she wasn't interested i said okay she wanted dressup she wanted every princess dressup thing there is .
that's what she wants she's into the princesses and .
gowns .
that's funny .
so you see it made noise .
you like that because it makes noise ?
you like noisy things i guess you're used to noise around the house ?
and you like to swim in the pool you're a swimmer .
right you like to go in the pool ?
and she says momma meme she says meme usually dada baba and baby .
the new one that's about it .
right ?
i think that's all of our words that we say .
we didn't have too many to fill in that we can say yet .
that's okay .
speaking of which can i by any chance get a blank copy of that word list ?
that i hadta fill out .
do you have one i can get my any chance ?
because i with my daughter i kept track like i asked for an extra one and then i wrote down when she said each word it was just neat i have it for her so i'd like to do it with her .
of course i fill the thing out and forget to make a copy of it before i even .
that's okay .
you know so i was like i'll have to remember to ask them for a blank one of that .
and then it's easier it makes it easy too because when i have to fill it out again i can i already know what i've been filling in each word she says so .
i don't actually have to think about it you know i just kind of went through and filled in the bubbles as she says more words you know .
because once they really start talking it gets crazy i remember .
you took the key ?
that would be great i'd appreciate it if i could get a blank one of it .
we'll get that for you .
we'll be really excited to see you again in a month .
in a month we come back ?
okay .
when do you want her between ten and a half .
ten and a half and eleven and a half .
and eleven okay .
so maybe the end of september ?
okay .
okay yup that'll be good .
can i call ?
i don't know her schedule yet and i can try and schedule when the older one can be in school too so .
perfect .
that'll be good .
we wouldn't have to bring her next time .
but she hasn't started preschool yet right ?
haven't gotten rid of that big sissy yet .
preschool always starts later she doesn't start till like the middle of september .
like the thirteenth she goes back so .
she's got a little while .
that was the only thing she wanted to play with last time .
yep yep .
last time she just shook those the whole time .
that was going to be my next question is what she played with last time .
yep .
so did she what was she interested in .
what was she interested in this time ?
well the first thing she went for is is the books and that she's really into books right now .
she likes to open them and close them and pretend to read them .
when we're at home we'll put books on the floor and she loves to just open and close the pages .
and then she went after all the play food after that .
she seems interested in in mostly the ones with different colors on them .
so she liked the cookie ?
the cookies .
and the pizza and then some of these blocks with like the different .
she was banging these together for a little bit .
does she like to do that at home make noise ?
yes she likes to bang blocks and things together or or shake things .
we actually bought her at the dollar store some spoons that she plays with now .
cause she liked to play with these so much .
she has her own measuring spoons now .
is that funny ?
that's that's her very excited face .
going back to the books did she like any book in particular ?
she picked up this one a couple of times .
and then these three right here are the ones she picked up .
does she have anything like that at home ?
we have good night moon at home .
and we also have a bunch of little doctor seuss books but not these ones .
and she we read them at home .
when we have story time she'll sit on my lap and we'll read them .
and do you think she would do you think she picked those because they seem familiar in any kind of way ?
well i have noticed at home if we lay out a bunch of books she likes to pick the same two or three over and over or so .
it is possible that they're familiar .
especially this one .
we ha we don't have this but we have the regular good night moon where the pictures are similar .
she's definitely starting to recognize things .
well mommy was touching it so now she's gotta come over here .
so she does have some favorites or at least those she's more interested in ?
more interested in .
if you lay it cause i'll i'll let her pick .
so i'll lay like four or five on the floor and let her pick which one we're going to read whichever one she picks up first .
so .
she does seem interested .
so she likes books .
she certainly likes the measuring spoons .
and you said she liked the play foods that had a lot of colors in them ?
that's what it seemed like to me like if i gave her like this she'd hold it for a second and then she's just done with it .
but anything that had multiple colors on it seems to be more interesting to her right now .
would she recognize any of these like a lot of babies have peas .
well i mean her peas don't look like that .
you know she's kinda eating baby food peas .
you know she didn't try to put anything in her mouth so she doesn't recognize it as food yet .
because i know when they're a little older they'll put play food in their mouth .
she doesn't none of this would be stuff that she would get to eat .
or or necessarily see in this form like her peas would be all ground up still .
okay .
she doesn't eat bread or .
she doesn't eat bread she doesn't eat pizza .
she doesn't eat ice cream .
okay how about the bottle or sippy cup was she interested in those ?
no but she doesn't dr have bottles either .
she's .
you like that clock ?
its got a face .
it definitely has colors and an interesting face .
but its got an interesting material .
was she interested in any of the stuffed animals today ?
not really i showed her a few .
but she didn't really seem into them .
she looked at the baby for about a second .
okay .
but that you know as she was making her way through .
she's not really into the stuffed animals yet .
when we have them at home she mostly just picks them up and throws them out of the way as she's going for something else .
no .
she smiled at it but she didn't stop what she was doing to go play with it .
see the piggy .
this one has a feel .
you feel that .
like what we have at home we have the feely books at home .
so does she like those books at home ?
but she's not so much interested in the dishes .
she likes the the teapot when you tip it over it like makes noise plays music .
that's what she plays with .
but she's not so much into the dishes yet .
she does .
she loves books she loves to turn pages .
num .
okay we're good i just have to ask you a few questions and then we're all done .
okay .
good job .
you're such a good baby .
yippee .
okay so what toys did she seem to be most interested in ?
the food .
food ?
she didn't even touch anything else .
haha and why do you think that is .
do you have any food at home ?
we don't and i don't know if that's why because it looks different .
she doesn't have a lot of stuffed animals either .
so i i don't know why she gravitated towards that .
the food that she was most interested in .
and was there a particular food that she was most interested in ?
the pizza .
she kept grabbing .
and wa what was she least interested in ?
she did look over at that stuff but she didn't even care about the stuffed animals .
and does she have any stuffed animals at home she plays with ?
she has an .
and she has a a bigger teddy bear .
that she kinda looks at but she's not really interacted with .
and she was looking at the books over there do you read books at home ?
we read books i think she was more looking at this .
but i don't know what she was really looking at because she didn't grab for anything .
and did she look at the doll at all ?
not that i noticed .
so it was all food do you play any kind of games at home like .
we do races at home because she's a fast crawler now and we have a dog so she just learned how to throw .
so now we play fetch before she would sit on my lap and we would play fetch and tug .
we do peekaboo but she doesn't seem interested in that .
she's bored with that .
okay .
sometimes she likes bubbles sometimes she doesn't .
there's no really way to tell .
it just depends on her mood that day .
and she has this wire .
a toy where you move the balls .
okay .
and she likes that .
we play with that .
are you still playing with food ?
and has there been any changes since your last visit ?
like which toys she is playing with etcetera .
no it last time she gravitated towards the food as well .
last time she grabbed one of the stuffed animals but didn't kinda like grabbed it and then saw the food and moved on .
and was she interested in the same kind of food did she pick up the pizza a lot ?
do you remember ?
i don't remember i think she was playing a lot with the spaghetti last time and the peas .
she held the peas the longest .
you didn't even see them gotta focused on the pizza .
i don't know maybe just cause we don't have a lot the one we have is bigger and so she doesn't manipulate it very well .
i guess she's just not interested in them .
do you have any of these foods like does she see you cooking with them or do you and your husband .
she just started eating finger foods .
okay .
and she's had little cut up spaghetti before .
okay .
but everything else's she's had doesn't look like this it looks pureed .
unless she has noticed eating sandwiches or pizza or whatever but .
the only thing that's here that she has eaten whole is spaghetti .
okay .
but it doesn't look like this its cut up .
haha .
and does she and has she been trying to use any utensils lately when she's been eating her food ?
she tries to use the spoon but it doesn't really work .
i mean she she kinda gets the concept like that its supposed to go towards her mouth .
but she'll either hold the spoon backwards or hold it upside down and the food falls off .
so sometimes if we let her have the spoon she'll take it and then grab it with the other hand and just shove it in her mouth .
but she hasn't actually used the spoon .
yup .
you're so little .
and when you're at home what books does she like to read ?
she likes well right now i don't know if i can say its her favorite because she speak for herself .
but she likes .
good night gorilla because when we read it she giggles .
i think she's sort of anticipating like the next page and we always point out the mouse .
like we'll read the words and then we'll point out the mouse .
but she also really likes anything that's soft that she can hold herself .
she likes that .
and anything that has elmo on the page .
because she recognizes him so if elmo is in the book she likes it .
you like elmo ?
yup .
and you said you didn't that she doesn't play with food at home .
we don't have food toys we have a little stuffed pot .
like its a silver pot and it has i don't know if its an apple or a beet but it it looks its round and red that goes in it .
but she doesn't play with the food itself she plays with the pot .
but its not hard plastic like this its fabric material .
and does she do anything else at home playing wise that we should know about ?
she likes to pull herself up now and that's kind of her own little game that she does with herself .
she's trying to stand independently so she'll actually spend a lot of time she'll let go with one hand .
and then she'll sort of lean back and think about letting go and that kind of occupies her for a while .
and we also have animal magnets on the fridge .
so that only holds her attention for about five minutes .
but she'll play with them and take them off and put them off and that's it .
what else do you do ?
what else ?
i guess now that she's getting older she is just getting into things .
when she was a little younger was she big on any other toys at home ?
she really liked her its not she had the playmate with like the arches and she was okay with that but we had one that was separate that was like an arch with three pulleys on it .
and when you pulled them it made music .
okay .
and she loves that .
she actually still plays with that .
we keep thinking that we'll put it away and she'll see it across the room and just randomly play with it one day .
but that's what she liked when she was younger she loved the pulling thing .
okay .
we are all done then .
all done !
we're all done !
did you hear that ?
she's playing .
so .
what do you think was her favorite toy ?
i think the .
the foods .
was probably her favorite .
the spaghetti and the spoons .
she seemed to really like the spoons .
though it's amazing it's .
it's not until the end that she .
that she's interested in this doll too .
so does she have one at home ?
she does not .
no so that's why i think it's interesting .
what about food ?
does she have any of that ?
we do we have a lot of .
we have a lot of this plastic food .
at home .
so i and .
i don't we don't .
don't have spoons though .
i don't think .
not that she plays with anyway .
i mean she eats with a spoon also .
she probably recognizes it .
she really seemed to like the spoons .
maybe we should get you some spoons .
when we go home ?
what of the food do you think she liked the most ?
i think she really liked the peas .
she kept picking those up and .
putting them back down and putting them in her mouth .
she liked that spaghetti .
and those are both things she eats at home so .
do you think she recognizes any of the food ?
and like connects it .
it's possible .
i mean especially the peas .
because she eats peas a lot and she really likes them .
so .
she probably and that's pretty much what they look like .
so i would think she probably recognizes those peas .
does she eat any of the other foods ?
of these foods .
no not really .
well spaghetti .
but that's about it .
i don't think she eats any of the other stuff though .
no not really .
i guess maybe pear .
and bread .
okay you do eat bread .
straight into the mouth .
what about the animals ?
do you have any pets at home ?
we do have pets .
we have cats .
but .
and we do have a few stuffed animals .
but none that look like these .
per say .
which ones did she play with ?
let's see .
well she liked that doll .
you still like that doll .
did you you didn't even really play with the animals .
did you i guess ?
that's right .
you even took the kangaroo and chucked it .
so spoons and food and doll for you ?
do you think she played with any of the same toys last time she was here ?
you know it's funny she did .
but only for a brief moment .
she played with this one a lot when she was here last time .
this dog with the pink thing .
but .
she didn't she only picked it up for a second this time .
but she did she did go right for it and pick it up and look at it .
she put it right back down .
but she did actually pick this one up .
and she did play with this one a lot last time .
did you guys play with the food last time too ?
or .
no i don't think she played with it at all last time .
i don't think she was interested .
she was interested in the spoons though .
she did play with the spoons a lot last time .
didn't you ?
you got a thing for spoons ?
you want to go home and get some spoons ?
you want to go home and get some spoons and eat ?
maybe we'll go home and we'll have some spoons and we'll eat .
and then we'll have spaghetti maybe ?
spaghetti .
did you look at any of the books ?
we did just for a moment .
i think we looked at this one .
and she was kind of interested in feeling it .
but when i started reading it she wasn't really interested .
there's probably too much else going on ?
now you're interested ?
in the mouth .
that's the biggest form of flattery there is .
you like that ?
now you're playing with it .
it's amazing about the power of persuasion .
that's upside down just so you know .
there you go .
well kind of .
there you go !
back upside down .
well .
nice job going from one hand to the other though .
feel that ?
isn't that nice ?
so you said .
what you're having for dinner she can eat that too ?
or does she have her own food ?
she usually eats what we eat .
we just cut it up really small .
so she usually and she just she just had spaghetti last night .
and she loved it .
so she does eat spaghetti .
she likes it a lot .
so did you recognize that spaghetti ?
because you ate i heard from your dad about fifty pounds of it .
i mean she doesn't always eat what we're eating but usually .
depends on if she likes it .
or if it's spicy .
or whatever .
well great .
well i think that's all the questions i have for you .
you know what ?
we're going to go .
we have to give our microphone back .
yes .
what do you think that she liked playing with the most today ?
probably the doll again .
well .
she kept going to the doll but then she liked the food too .
i think .
okay .
it's funny cause after we came the last time and i realized she was into it we did get a few dolls .
and she has been she's been very into dolls and we have a few books of like baby faces and stuff like that .
and checking out her babies she has we have a few friends that have babies but .
checking out their faces and their features and stuff so .
that's really sweet !
does she how does she play with the dolls at home ?
she eats them sometimes .
and then but she'll also sometimes she'll pat them and sometimes we put them to bed .
and sometimes she'll feed them .
but more a lot of times when she's playing with it her brother's also there so he'll help take care of the doll or whatever so she'll watch but .
do you have play food at home ?
we do have play food at home .
yes .
is that what she uses to feed ?
yes yes she will she and her brother also play store .
so he will .
he'll be like i'd like a .
or i'd like spaghetti .
we do have spaghetti at home .
and so he'll then he'll give it to her and .
so it's cute .
that's sweet !
he's a good big brother .
do you think there are any foods here that she's now that are familiar to her either by look or name ?
well the cookie maybe she doesn't really eat cookies but her brother does once in a while so she may see that or or she might know it as a cracker cause she eats crackers .
i do not know what else .
peas she might know .
sometimes she'll make a face if we say peas .
you have to pizza you know a little you may know a little .
pizza ?
do you know the pizza cause dad william has pizza at home .
plays pizza .
is she still drinking milk juice or anything out of the bottle ?
she doesn't drink out of a bottle but she drinks water out of a sippy cup .
okay .
so .
she never took to the bottle unfortunately so .
so we went right to the sippy cup right !
that's good .
do you read books at home ?
we do read books at home .
we read a lot with her with her brother .
and then right before she goes to bed we read one book so .
okay .
are some are any of them on animals or what you read today ?
we do have we do have a farm book that's sort of similar to this yes .
okay .
and actually she has another book that we read that has like a pink has a pink poodle sort of like this in it .
and i'm trying to think what else do we read ?
we have baby faces that she likes too .
it has the baby doing different things .
like angry baby or happy baby or dirty baby .
clean baby !
right ?
yup .
and she knows measuring spoons cause we have a whole cupboard of .
all of our baking stuff i just let them play with them and then when i use it i'll just clean it but .
so .
that's a clock let us not eat the clock .
so she's into spoons .
yes .
she likes to try to feed herself .
even though she can't .
and with the animals are you working on like animal sounds with him her or william ?
well william knows his and we sing little william had a farm .
and so cause she also well we have like the little people farm .
and so he'll bring out the piece pieces .
and he'll he he actually does the sounds for her so .
she knows .
she will do once in a while a lion .
cause his favorite he has a little lion that he loves and he he growls or does the and she'll she'll do that sometimes too but .
right ?
she doesn't really do that like she'll she'll sometimes try you you know try to but .
but no she like they do like playing farm .
we have lots of farm stuff .
what do you think was her least favorite toy or unliked toy ?
i don't know .
you seem to like everything ?
was there anything that you presented to her that she really didn't .
she would didn't .
trying to think .
she played a little with the frog i guess .
the chicken .
the book !
she'll usually sit for more more like if we're reading she'll sit * i'll be able to read the whole thing and she'll sit and sort of look or whatever but .
today she seemed to be more into the food and the probably .
and the and the other things .
okay .
well she certainly enjoyed chewing .
okay sorry no .
just very calm .
she looks like she's lunging to me hello !
very cute !
is she eating any solid you said she is eating peas ?
well she's eating the peas in the i mean ground peas but yes .
right .
and she eats she eats she eats pretty much any food ground up .
and then she eats .
little pieces we'll do very soft either sweet potato .
or avocado .
right ?
because we only have the two bottom teeth so .
chewing chewing's kinda hard .
but she eats crackers .
and she eats puffs and cheerios .
what else do you eat ?
you gnaw on bread sometimes .
and muffins .
she likes muffins .
so a lot of bready products .
soft cause they're soft .
they're soft .
right .
okay .
we tried green beans but they weren't soft enough .
so we have to wait .
she's having fun .
she she does apples sometimes too .
like we'll peel it just like little pieces and she'll just keep chomping it until it .
right a key fell out !
should we put it back ?
we put it back ?
it's a purple key !
right in the mouth .
i know .
exactly !
okay okay alright .
do you have your next appointment scheduled already ?
no .
do you think what do you think vincent liked the most here today ?
probably the baby dolls .
and .
and the books seemed to light up his books seemed to light up his face the most .
and the and when i rolled the thing .
the baby dolls his sister has a bunch of baby dolls where he's always trying to get at them .
and she's like .
no those are my toys .
and then she you know moves them away so i think he was very excited to get his hands one finally .
we we roll a lot of balls back and forth .
and he loves to he loves to be able to turn a page and gets very excited about seeing a new .
a new page once he makes this movement .
and you know it's like like a miracle look it's a whole different picture .
and then .
i i guess new toys we don't have food toys at home accessible to him yet .
they're downstairs .
and .
so we're not downstairs in in sort of basement as much as you know we have a finished basement .
they're also some kind of smaller so .
they're little chokeable pieces to them and stuff because they're you know a six year old style of food pieces so .
do you read books at home ?
we read books at home .
he looks through books a lot he's .
he'll he'll be with you know we'll have these type of board books that he will just initiate turning the pages you know by himself .
whether i'm facilitating or not .
and he likes to throw things .
do you have any of the same books ?
gosh .
no not the not the same exact books .
okay how about the food do you think there's anything here that he already he knows the that he recognizes the name of ?
i don't think so .
i haven't i haven't .
well i haven't told him any names of food i don't know who else is talking to him so .
maybe he does but .
he's still on like formula ?
he's still on formula with a with some mush .
you know and he just started with some crackers .
so i told him cra you know he he knows the word cra not knows it but i mean i've .
told him the word crackers when i hand it to him .
i don't know if he knows it or not .
and then bottle .
and .
i don't know if i do anything for the i don't think i do anything for the cereal .
i say more to him a lot like if he wants some more something .
i'll say i'll say more .
i think all other food items i haven't named yet .
he scoots .
he scoots his sister scooted too which is funny because they're not .
they're not biologically related .
i got the two scooters in the world !
yes !
yes i did !
you should you should give me a towel afterwards .
do you guys play with stuffed animals at home ?
i don't play with him with stuffed animals his sister plays with stuffed animals a lot with him and makes them talk and makes them .
you know .
bounce around .
he doesn't i haven't see him .
go for a stuffed animal and play with it intently on his own .
like i do w you know with a ball and a book and this .
things that can fall apart he really likes .
he's we've got this sort of wooden magnetic ball .
it's got little wooden parts that attach together by magnets to form a sphere .
and .
it was his sister's and both of them roll it .
both of them like rolling it .
and taking it apart .
only his sister would take it apart with her hands .
and he picks it up and he drops it .
and so all the the pieces go like that .
so they both like to take things apart but it's like .
different techniques for getting them there .
so he he likes movement a lot in toys .
do you remember what he played what he was most interested in last time ?
gosh .
i can't remember but i remember we didn't play with the stuffed animals at all .
i don't think we played with the food at all .
so what was there left books and spoons ?
he likes spoons a lot .
i don't know if there was a ball there last time or if he was even .
aware of balls .
well what would you say today was like his least favorite thing ?
did you try to get him to play with something and he just wasn't having it ?
what did i .
maybe the stuffed animal actually .
i mean he kind of looked at if for a while .
and then turned away .
and now you're going to disprove me but that's okay .
it was you know i tried .
i didn't do that but .
but everything else he picked up with he seemed to stay with for a while or do something to you know .
not just kind of look at it and toss it down really .
and would you say this is how you play at home usually ?
i'll spend i'll spend some time with him on the floor .
sometimes we'll you know hide the toys i don't think i did it this time like this and make it go away and then .
have it appear again .
sometimes .
ow ow !
sometimes he'll try to put the toy in my mouth after he takes it .
yes !
yes and then sometimes we just play with each other .
like this .
and crawl all over the place .
and do little .
and do little head bellies .
sometimes we do that .
certainly .
so did you notice anything different from the last time ?
yes .
last time he was not in .
if if i'm remembering correctly .
books were not so such a big deal to him then .
and he was more interested in the stuffed animals and the food .
but like one of the biggest differences i think is .
it's like his interest in more in processes now of turning pages of the book or .
putting the cookies into something .
and less he still examines everything but he wants to do something with it now .
whereas before he just .
wanted to look at it and taste it .
and now he's trying to do something with it .
that was the biggest difference i saw .
interesting .
and he likes books .
he sits and reads his brother's books .
what would you say was his favorite thing today ?
this book .
and the cookies .
okay .
the farm book and then putting the cookies in .
alright you want this back ?
i know it's lunchtime .
and like putting the cookies into something .
so doing something .
and do you have that book at home ?
we don't have this book .
we have we have lots of touch books where you feel .
but we do not have that book no .
okay .
do they have animals in them too ?
do you think he's familiar with any of the animal names that were in there ?
i think so .
because we i think ducks .
because we go and feed ducks all the time so .
ducks and probably the cow .
because his brother l you know we look at cows a lot .
in books .
and sheep i guess .
horse is the one that they're not as familiar with .
do you think that there is .
i mean what was his the thing that he liked the least ?
he was not interested in the stuffed animals .
not like last time ?
no you weren't interested in them .
no ?
did you try to introduce some of them to him ?
i tried to introduce the zebra .
and he kinda touched it .
and the frog .
he wanted to poke its eye .
but .
he didn't want go he didn't once want to go over and examine them so .
and do you play with stuffed animals at home ?
yup !
we have them at home .
but neither him nor his brother like to play them .
they're there .
they'll look at them and hug and go away .
they don't they don't play with them .
how about the food ?
the food .
he loved the food .
he had fun he wanted to taste everything .
which is lovely .
i'm sure they're clean .
but he wanted to taste everything .
cookie .
he wa he the cookies .
the little m&m cookies .
and the spaghetti .
he liked the the spaghetti .
do you think he's familiar with those names ?
yes .
definitely cookie .
and pizza .
he knows .
that cookie's a hit .
he's taking the cookie with him everywhere .
i was surprised he wasn't as interested with the little sippycup .
is he working with sippycups now ?
he has he has cups .
he's a bad flirt .
yes you are .
you're a bad flirt .
what about the baby doll ?
did you guys play with that ?
we played with the baby doll .
and only at the end he was willing to touch it .
he just sat there and smiled at the baby doll .
like .
curious but i don't know if he was a little intimidated by it .
i mean he certainly wasn't afraid of the baby doll .
but he didn't want to .
touch until the end .
and then he finally kept touching its mouth .
okay .
but i had it touching his ha his arm .
and he would just smile and look at the hand like ".
we do not have any dolls .
so this was kinda fun for him .
new for him .
i pl i was having it sit next to him and touch his arm and .
he would just stare at the arm and smile .
i mean i'm pretty sure he thought it was definitely another baby .
he just didn't know what to do with the other baby .
except smile at it .
and i was surprised he didn't poke the other baby in the eye .
you didn't poke the other baby in the eye .
what's wrong ?
are you sitting on things ?
you sitting on a burger ?
sitting on a burger ?
don't get upset !
do you have pretend food at home ?
yes .
you do ?
although we don't have pretend cookies or .
spaghetti or pizza so .
and are you playing with the pre .
is matthew also playing with you ?
matthew plays with the pretend food .
and he mostly .
it has a grill .
he goes over and hits the button and turns the grill on .
that's what he likes to do .
he's going to be a grill man right ?
what else did he play with .
well now he's playing with the spoons .
now he's playing with the spoon .
i offered him the spoons because he has spoons .
and he normally likes them .
and he .
looked at them shook a few times and .
chucked them .
okay .
and he tries to feed himself .
it's a disaster but he tries .
yes you try .
he's been trying to feed himself since he was six months old .
so .
he's a little independent guy .
yes .
both my children are very independent .
i think i got through all the questions here .
is there anything else you thought was interesting in this play session ?
i g i think just the biggest things was the shift away from the stuffed animals and more into books .
come on !
can you navigate the pile of food to get to mommy ?
distracted by bread .
i know you're ready for lunch .
what do you think he liked playing with the most ?
this little spaghetti thing .
and that one .
and the baby .
that's interesting .
i do not know why .
that he kept these almost the entire time .
then he would whack the baby on the head with them .
so apparently that's what he really enjoyed to do .
did he does he have a baby at home ?
no .
like a babydoll ?
no ?
no .
no he's got lots of he has like little animals but no babies .
okay .
we're a you know a family of boys so we don't have babydolls .
don't you dare !
you come here .
does he so how does he usually play with his other animals ?
he usually gnaws on them .
gnaws on them ?
yes .
was he doing that with these .
yes he was everything goes in the mouth .
so he usually eats anything and .
we have a little one of those rubber like bracelet things .
that is big enough that he can chew on it and it doesn't really and i'm not too worried about him being able to chew through it .
but everything he he chews everything .
so we have a lot of hard toys that he chews on .
and he likes to rip paper and eat that and .
he has a couple electronic books that he'll flip the pages and it'll do like music and stuff .
that's really neat .
so i guess di how did he feel about books here ?
not today .
he when i was doing i was doing a peekaboo book and one of the little papers fell out .
and then he got interested because it was something he could chew on .
so at home do you have the paper books do you use paper books ?
not with him .
no but his brothers have paper books .
okay .
no wires .
that's usually what we do when you're crawling around ?
no wires .
but we tried this one too and he touched it for an instant and then he was like .
then he was just like nope .
more interested in the spaghetti thingies and banging them .
is that typically what he does at home too ?
more into toys than books or ?
for the most part until he realizes again that they make noise and then he likes to smack them and then they make noise some more so .
was there anything .
has any of the books that you read do you think any of the words in it or the stories were familiar to him ?
well i know like in this one we've got the they had ducks and the sheep and stuff and i think he knows that they're animals .
if nothing else .
so we've been to a farm before and so they he's seen them before .
but i do not know if he really understands like what they are .
but i was just trying to get him to touch the soft .
because we have cats at home and and they're soft too ?
when you're nice to them .
how about the peekababy boo book ?
we do peekaboo at home .
but not with a book .
but we do peekaboo and he seems to he's starting to understand that you're still there .
so he starts to look around the hands looking for so .
now you're going to find other things ?
what's that ?
how about the foods is are has he tried these foods or are these any of these foods that you played with today or that you talked about are they foods that you've had at home ?
he has had spaghetti type things at home but not they don't look like this .
but he's seen us eat it .
i'm just not we're just not there yet with him .
with the these particular like actual .
but he's eaten bread before which is why i was kinda surprised he didn't go for the bread .
did you bring did you present it to him ?
i put them i put some something on it .
and he just was like whatever .
and then he did the same thing that i .
i put plates down too because i feed him like green beans and stuff on plates and and he didn't want his spaghetti on the plate .
so he took it right back off .
that's what you did .
how about any other foods that you tried to introduce to him or that might be familiar .
no .
that he picked up ?
nope just he was more interested in .
well he's got the peas now it looks like .
he's had peas before .
actual peas he likes to squish them .
but but no the only things that he was picking up were the the spaghetti .
that was it .
now you're going to use the spoon ?
so today was his first time kinda playing with baby and doing things with baby ?
well he did that the last time too .
okay .
he noticed the baby the last time also .
and was interested .
but he plays with his shadow in the window and in the mirror so .
and so he's he sees himself and so he knows he's joe and he knows what he looks like .
so i think that seeing the baby doll is enough of a lookalike th for him .
so do you what did you notice any differences from his the first time he came and played with these toys ?
well he .
seemed to not be as interested in as many things .
it seemed last time he was more willing to look at other things that i you know showed him .
and this time he had more of an idea of this is what i want and so this is what i'm going to do .
that's funny .
but he also wasn't mobile last time and so he's mobile now .
and so at home usually it's you know the wires it's always wires with him .
he takes after his father .
are you going to talk to the baby ?
has he had peanut butter ?
no ?
no .
but he i think he liked the fact that it rolled .
okay .
because i i put it up and he bangs on things so i gave him this and banged on it and he's like no not going to bang on it today .
how about any differences between do you have any of these toys at home ?
just i mean we have a variety of st the stuffed animals but again he wasn't really interested in the stuffed animals .
but he did i think recognize the bear .
because we have lots of bears at home .
and so i think that was something he he recognized but .
the rest of it he wasn't he was more interested in these .
things he can shove in his mouth and .
that makes sense .
things he can chew on .
he's got five teeth and he puts them to good use .
do you think that he's got any attraction to color ?
like for example the peas are green and the frog is green and .
just some things that he's been were there any trends across color ?
no .
not really .
i don't think .
it's you know he well he's going for red things now it looks like so maybe he's more interested in red .
but his brothers have favorite colors are red and blue right now .
so we have a lot of red and blue things .
so but even at home when he has a when he notices his bib and what's on his bib he has a tendency to if it's colorful .
like we have elmo ones .
he seems to play with the bib more than he wants to eat .
okay .
so it's very possible that he likes red .
i just wanted to i always ask parents if it's you think it's the noise it's the texture or the color you know that's really making them gravitate towards particular toys .
across the different toys .
i don't think so .
i mean he's now he's more interested just in food in general it looks like .
he uses his feet a lot like that .
it's so funny .
he pulls things closer to him with his feet .
with his feet ?
he'll he'll kick and kick and kick and he's realized that things will come closer to him sometimes .
it's really funny to watch him .
is there anything that you noticed that was different this time that you want to add ?
i know we kind of talked about it .
that's funny because when we play at home honestly we don't usually when i'm with him i don't usually play with like the toys .
we have a basket of things that he can you know go and play with whenever he wants to and he goes and he you know picks everything out and knocks the bu the basket over and stuff .
but he and i we we throw you in the air and .
we've been working on his crawling more and his standing on his own and and things .
but he he's pretty good at just finding things .
entertaining himself a little bit ?
pretty much .
he's he doesn't need me which has been a help .
that's great .
every so often he gets it in his head that he really needs me but for the most part he's pretty independent .
i think it's because of his brothers because his brothers really .
entertain him .
and i'm not i think i'm not as interesting as they are .
well they're smaller ?
right ?
a little bit smaller .
they're six but .
but they're shorter the .
and they tend to not pay as much attention to him sometimes and so he's he gets into more things when they're around than when i am .
no .
i'm just surprised he hasn't gone after the wires more .
because that's his favorite thing to do .
go after wires pull them up pull them chew on them .
that is your favorite thing to do at home .
pull on wires .
that's too big for you .
that's too big !
so i think that's it .
okay .
for this portion .
yes .
of course .
so what do think .
she liked the most here today ?
i mean when she came she played pretty much on this side of the with the toys .
so just the stuffed animals and then the .
i mean she's got prob when she walked in the stuffed animals are the first thing she walked over to .
she liked the doll but i think that the doll is too big for her .
she tried to pick it up but i think it's a little too .
too awkward .
she has a small babydoll .
what does she play with stuffed animals at home ?
she has she has stuffed animals at home that she'll pull out .
out of i mean in terms of how much playing she has .
they're not the little people they're called animalville .
it's the same thing but they're little animal characters .
so she has that but she'll you know walk around it and stuff and then she has between a regular babydoll and then she has one that crawls .
that'll she'll .
pretty much entertain herself with but she's back and forth and back and i mean she'll walk into her room pull out a toy walk over play with the toy a little bit walk back to her room .
so nothing keeps her interest for very long .
i mean she definitely likes her dolls .
i noticed that she'll go and get her dolls .
you think she recognized the names of any of the animals that you played with today ?
maybe dog cause we have you know we have the dogs at home .
so definitely the dog .
i mean dog and cat i think are the two that are the most common to her cause that's what we have at the house .
how about the foods that you may have played with today were there any that she was familiar with or that she really liked or maybe wasn't familiar with ?
she tried to drink out of the sippycup .
which is what she is drinking out of now .
i gave her the bottle but she didn't have much interest in it and it's been a while a little while since she's actually had a bottle so i don't know if she's just been .
lost interest in it but otherwise .
not really .
and what about the books do you have any of the same books at home ?
she has not the same but she has a bunch of like the small picture books and like the hard books i don't know she has like a bin of books that she can dig into and sometimes i'll put her in her crib with just a bunch of books and she'll just flip through them for a little while .
so .
so usually the books are for like bedtime or like relaxing ?
sometimes just for relaxing .
and then you know if i want to try and get a couple of things done or go take a shower i'll put her in the crib with them so that it'll entertain her for a while .
i know the baby is so big .
do you think that the book that you went through she may have recognized or was familiar with some of things that were in that book ?
i don't know how familiar she is with a lot of you know like because she's not saying anything yet .
so i'm not sure she's familiar with it yet .
okay .
i don't think so .
okay .
were there any differences between this visit and the last visit as far as what toys she liked ?
she actually sat with me for a book this time which last time i don't i think i tried and she wasn't really having it .
was she walking last time ?
no .
well how long ago was last time ?
end of july .
july thirtieth .
not yet .
she starting walking at nine .
at nine months .
okay .
a little before nine months .
so last time she wasn't into the books what about this time was she not into something ?
she i mean like she would start here and she went through some of the stuffed animals and threw out the ones that she had no interest in .
i mean it was between the fox and the little zebra i noticed that she picked up and carried around and i can't think of anything at home that looks like .
the two of them .
she's cute .
thank you .
and do you remember what she liked the most last time ?
i think last time she played a lot with the food .
i think she sorted through the food a lot .
so this time she's more into like the animals and dolls if you could be .
what is that ?
do you think she is into colors noise or sound ?
she loves music .
she's got a couple of toys at home that you press the buttons and it will play music for her and shh same thing with com like if she's walking by and there's a commercial or a tv show at the end of a show you know sometimes they'll have music at the .
end of a show she'll stop to dance .
she's into them that's good .
yes .
okay is she into is she into any foods now or is she still on like cereal and formula ?
she eats whatever pretty much whatever we have as long as it's not too spicy or we don't give her meat .
we're trying not to give her not trying trying really hard not to give her meat .
okay .
but so she eats i mean she'll eat whatever we're eating .
she still has a sippycup and i'll put cereal in the sippycup but .
lots of fruit .
right lots of fruit .
so probably like you know the ice cream cone .
is probably not too familiar .
no .
like i mean she'll like the little animal crackers or i was going to say .
like even the cookies here she doesn't eat any of these kinds of cookies .
i guess the sippycup she picked up and tried to drink out of .
so that i think she recognized as .
okay i think that that's it for the for the questions .
okay .
i just wanted to get a feel for what was going on in the play session .
doesn't taste very good .
can you give a kiss ?
give a kiss ?
no ?
okay .
i'm ready to ask you some questions .
okay .
well first of all what did she seem to like to play with ?
well let's see here .
the pizza .
the pink icecream .
not the white icecream .
she liked the keys only after i gave them to her though .
okay .
that that cup and then back to the bottle .
this is like always a staple .
so i'm thinking .
we recently have gotten into giving her the bottle .
trying to wean her from breastfeeding .
and so she sees th her bottle and gets excited .
and maybe that's why she's you know drawn to this one .
she may recognize that's a bottle .
and she saw the liquid in there and she's trying to get to it .
but it's not real so she doesn't know that .
but still she keeps going back to the bottle .
out of all these toys the bottle .
well she's showing her preference ?
but she did play with th a few other things .
she likes pooh .
again we have pooh at home so she .
but when i went to go give her the duck she .
same reaction as this .
well not as as intense as the bee .
i don't think she likes dark colored i don't know .
i i hate to associate black with scary but i think she just doesn't know .
i think that colors are more vibrant and less threatening to her for some reason .
i don't know why .
even this one didn't give her the bad reaction that this duck did .
and then of course she just doesn't .
i think that's a texture thing .
right .
those little tentacle things .
she doesn't like that .
did you show her anything else that's a like a darker one ?
i did .
the otter .
and she would she wasn't she didn't cower away from it .
but you know this i don't know what i don't know what the difference is .
but she did not like this one .
and the zebra .
she was a little leery of the zebra .
interesting .
but but the otter .
when she i was trying to get her when she was hugging pooh .
trying to switch her up to get her to hug the otter .
she wouldn't hug the otter .
no way .
so do so is it mainly just pooh that she seemed to like ?
that she hu that she hugged and kissed .
go ahead momma .
i see you .
how about the dog ?
did she do .
she liked the pink poodle .
she liked the poodle .
but she might just be like her sister .
a pink fanatic .
she could be .
and al you know children's toys are often colorful .
so she may just be used to that .
to the colors .
right .
because this is this is pretty .
you're doing so good .
but i don't know i think this is pretty .
but that's me as an adult .
i can .
it's hard .
i see what you mean .
they're trying to make it look realistic .
but most children's toys are really colorful .
are really colorful .
right .
hope you like that .
and she did like the pizza .
and the the green peas for a long time until they fell out of her reach .
you like that ?
and how about any other of the food items ?
no .
she picked up the pastrami .
but that was it was just to whatever trying to get to something else .
she did mess with the cookies this time .
i know last time she did she had the cookies in her hand a lot .
but she did like the pizza .
and th and this is you know significantly smaller than pizza that we eat .
so but maybe she recognizes the shape of it .
i wonder .
but we don't eat pizza a lot .
so i can't image that you know she knows what anything what this is .
maybe she just likes the colors .
and and the fact that it's kind of pliable kind of you know soft .
and she is teething so maybe when she put it in her mouth it helped her .
she didn't want to look at the book .
she did not .
nuhhuh .
she liked the only the peekaboo because we play peekaboo .
you know and once i started to say you know and show her .
and then she she you know she's like i like that .
but at first she didn't want anything to do with it .
i hadta come back to it a second time for her to to see that .
it's great that you showed her a range of things .
you showed her everything .
i wanted her to see everything .
just so we could get an idea of what makes her tick a little bit and .
she looked at the clock and she tried to take the eye off .
everybody's .
you can see that that's been done so many times too .
that's right it used to actually have hands .
i'm sure .
it has a soft kind of texture .
how about this ?
an eagle .
i don't know .
do you like it ?
dropped your pea .
let's see .
okay so if there's anything else .
does she like anything .
these are supposed to be kind of like blocks .
gotcha .
did she like .
well i was trying to show her the peanut butter .
but you know i don't know if she associates the word with what it is .
her sister is only just now coming into being able to have peanut butter .
so you know she doesn't get exposed to it a whole lot .
right .
she hasn't heard that word so much .
nuhhuh nuhhuh .
let's see .
but when you mention that they are blocks .
they do make a noise .
look at that quinn .
look .
i don't know if they are .
but some of the kids treat them like blocks .
they .
so i've thinking of them like that .
and they're really flat .
they can be stacked .
look at that .
you could put them like that .
don't you ?
maybe the next visit you'll do that .
you see ?
some kids pick up these and then .
see ?
you see ?
how did i not know it ?
it gives !
delicious .
okay and i think .
and then the baby .
did she .
not so much .
no ?
not so much .
she she looked like okay .
i tried to giv show her the bottle .
she took the bottle from me and didn't want to deal with the baby .
so no no takes on the baby .
no takes on the baby .
i guess that's a good sign .
yep .
does she have toys like these at home ?
she does .
she has a lot of stuffed animals .
she has several babies .
but they are a lot smaller tha you know this one is more almost close to her size .
i know .
but she has several babies that are probably a you know maybe a little about this size or a little bit bigger .
okay .
she also has some little babies too that you know but .
they have diapers and bottles and even has a little stroller that she likes to play with .
she has .
but she has blocks and her sister's legos .
she likes to play with those and make a mess and throw them all over the place .
quinn .
but this walking .
she just took her like first few independent steps last night .
and now you can't tell her she can't walk .
that's great .
that's that's going to be .
you're going to be doing that all the time now .
now that you know you can .
go !
go !
i see you !
and she does a little i did it dance .
go do it .
can you do i did it dance ?
so proud .
big girl .
you're a big girl .
okay .
you've covered everything .
i think you know our questions because you covered everything .
or i don't know .
i'm a teacher too .
that's why .
so i try to analyze things .
i was going to say .
i have questions and you answered everything so .
i can appreciate what it is you're doing .
that's why .
you are a teacher .
that makes a difference .
and the way you showed her things .
you put things together for her and how they work together .
although i don't work with the prim .
i work with sixth grade so .
but still .
there must be something in just being a teacher .
woah look at you girl !
i see you .
i see you .
well let's turn these things off and then she can have a new toy .
okay .
she prob i'm glad she probably forgot about that new toy .
so i just have a couple questions for you .
okay .
last time he was really interested in the stuffed animals .
which i thought was odd because he doesn't really play with stuffed animals at home .
but this time he completely ignored them .
what did he seem the most interested in this time ?
this time i was really surprised that he went for this first .
because last time he didn't really care about it .
you don't have any dolls at home ?
no .
and last time the thing he was most interested in were the food things .
like the peas i remember he really liked .
and i think some of that i'm not sure he knows it's food .
i think it's nice to chew on .
everything goes in his mouth .
and he also .
really liked the keys last time .
which we didn't actually have before our visit .
but after the visit we ended up going and buying him some keys .
and he usually loves books .
and he just i think it's because there's all these new toys he s just doesn't care about the books .
but at home he's we read a lot .
so you don't think he recognizes the names of any of these ?
i don't think so no .
not yet .
i mean he eats peas .
but i'm not sure that he knows .
what they look like because he usually eats them mashed up .
he's just kinda started to eat them as finger food .
the spaghetti ?
which i mean he has pasta .
he's never had spaghetti .
so i don't i really don't think he knows that that's spaghetti .
i think he just .
likes to chew on it .
no i was wondering that .
but i don't think he can .
okay you want my pen ?
the other thing i thought was really interesting .
and i don't know if this this could've been just me trying to do it more .
but it looked like he was trying to put the food onto the plate .
which surprised me because he doesn't .
he's still too young .
we don't give him i mean if we cut up food that he uses as finger food we just put it on his tray of his highchair .
he doesn't i mean if i gave him a plate he'd chuck it onto the floor .
but that coulda just been me wishing .
okay and the animals do you think he recognizes any of the animals' names ?
or the books ?
i don't think so yet .
no .
do you have any of these toys at home ?
the k we've got keys .
we've obviously got books .
and we have stuffed animals .
but none of these specific ones .
but we don't have any food toys yet .
hah look what i just spotted !
there's a ball here that i didn't even notice !
balls are usually his favorite !
jack look at what we missed !
look .
exactly .
now if we had noticed that we probably would've played with that the whole time .
that's okay .
alright .
so is the next one at one year ?
or is it at like eighteen months ?
this is your second visit right ?
right .
so next month .
okay .
and then the fourth one will be when he's .
two .
okay .
haha good times buddy !
look at this ball !
alright .
good job jack .
thank you so much for being so good .
i have a few questions now .
is there was there a type of a group of toys that she enjoyed playing with the most ?
she's playing with the food toys right now .
is there anything particular in the food group that she wanted .
the cookies .
the icecream .
you want to read the book again ?
and the hamburger .
left foot left foot right foot right .
okay was there anything that she was least interested in do you think ?
i do not know .
animals ?
i do not know .
mckayla you cannot eat the hamburger .
does she have any toys like this at home that she plays with ?
yes .
but she has mostly blocks .
she has mostly her boys toys her brother's toys .
and a lot of stuffed animals .
but .
and how old is her brother ?
two .
so what types of toys does he have that she plays with ?
trucks and cars and you know .
he doesn't like girly toys and she wants to play with his toys .
and dogs .
see she likes the teddy bears .
no you can't eat the doggie .
can't eat the doggie .
you want to kiss the doggie ?
dogs are not pink .
okay .
and does she pay attention when you're reading the book ?
she does .
and does she have books at home ?
yes .
is there one that you read to her a lot ?
i read different books but they like doctor seuss .
but she'll pay attention she'll pay attention at night to the entire story .
do you ever play with pretend food or anything like that at home ?
does she have any of those ?
we don't pretend with the food .
no .
they're going to eat it .
do you think she recognizes the names of any of the food ?
she knows what the cookie is .
she definitely knows what this is .
she knows .
that's why she had it for so long .
and she knows what the pizza is .
she knows let me see .
she knows most of her foods by by sight and by word .
so if you say you want to cookie she's going to sit there and look for the cookie and then she's going to see if it's a type of cookie that she wants .
she knows what she wants .
say and that looks like the cookies that i like !
it's chocolate chip !
is she using utensils or anything are you trying to get her to use utensils or anything yet ?
no .
am i supposed to ?
i do not know i'm just wondering .
i do not know either i know her brother does but .
sometimes they like to play with some of those .
she plays with the utensils but not at not at feeding time .
right .
i was just wondering .
you're not going to i gotta cookie in my bag .
do you think she knows the names of any of the stuffed animals that you were pointing out ?
she knows probably the name of a dog .
everything else i don't even know the name of so .
and maybe a bee .
maybe .
and maybe a zebra .
but other than this i don't even know what these animals are !
you should have little cheat sheets for the parents .
like what is this ?
exactly .
what is this ?
otter .
you think it's an otter right ?
okay .
what is this ?
ya'll are terrible ya'll should know these names .
what is this ?
looks like its from a a character from a movie .
it does but what is it ?
okay .
i don't feel bad then .
hold on .
what is this ?
i think that's another otter .
alright i'm going to give you that one because i that's what i assumed but i wasn't sure .
hold on .
see some of these critters we don't even know what they are so how are we going to teach them ?
okay i know what that is .
okay i know what th .
okay .
i just didn't know these three .
okay i know what that's a fox .
alright .
ya'll should ya'll should take animal lessons .
so you can tell us when we're wrong .
okay .
i'm ready .
i noticed that you were saying some of the sounds like what the dog said and stuff like that .
do you think she recognizes ?
they do .
that they do .
because when they start seeing them live they go mama .
say when i learn how to talk i'll already know what they are .
and does she have any of these books at home ?
she has goodnight moon .
she has doctor seuss but i don't have this one .
i don't have these this one either .
but she has a lot they have i they have this children's club books and they send me books all the time .
so a lot of them are like hard like red .
like last night i read them it was called the red book .
and it's everything red and you're just talking about you know apples and strawberries and and you know anything that's red .
and then you just read them red .
and then one night you read them yellow and .
you know they'll sit there and pretend like they're listening .
great .
you hungry ?
say i must be !
i'll go feed you .
say i still have a cookie .
she still has the cookie .
that's a shame .
that's icecream .
icecream .
and there's my cookie .
no it's not caillou .
say caillou .
caillou .
so you said that you read her a lot of books at home do you think that she prefers to listen to the books or does she like to play with her toys or ?
at night they .
i think it's because they don't want to go to sleep it could be .
but they'll sit there intently when you read the book .
if they don't have if she didn't have all this distraction she'll just sit there and let you read the book to her .
and then sometimes she'll try to you think she's talking or whatever she'll get the book and look at it and you know try to play with it .
that's a bear .
say .
isabelle .
is she ready about that time ?
she'll she has a little bit of an attention span but .
say hello ?
so with regards to the last time you were here did you notice any difference with what she wanted to play with the toys ?
last time she didn't i don't think she knew what was what .
at all .
i mean was just i think i remember last time just showing her things and .
her just kind of looking at them .
but i mean i think she was in the bumbo seat last time so she couldn't move anywhere .
now she kind of you know she wants to touch everything .
so definitely a a big difference .
she can you know somewhat participate in like the books or playing or .
you know show some reaction .
no !
what were some of the toys .
like that .
i'm sure any of the food i gave her she put in her mouth last time .
maybe holding onto a stuffed animal ?
but .
i don't think she really did anything with the books last time .
and neither time she didn't she didn't seem interested in the babydoll .
the babydoll just hasn't .
no it means i guess nothing to her .
what do you think was her favorite thing this time ?
probably putting the food in her mouth .
the play food .
do you think she recognized the names of any of the food items ?
h doubtful .
i don't i don't think so .
no .
which food items did you play with today ?
the pizza slices .
she played with this .
the waffles i think she was banging together .
i think she might've been interested in the liquid .
in h in this one .
and in this one .
she might've touched this .
i think that was it .
i don't think we .
played with any other food items .
and so you don't have food items at home like pretend .
we do we do have similar of these i th actually i remember her play with .
because i do we have these exact ones at home .
this and we have the waffles .
and s the bottle .
at home .
so she might might've recognized those .
does she eat any of these foods ?
i mean .
but everything i give her it's like cut up really small so it doesn't resemble .
you know any of these .
you know the way they are .
la .
la .
the way these are now .
right .
la .
resemble anything .
but i mean she pretty much eats everything .
as long as i just like cut it up in tiny pieces for her .
okay .
and then so you also played with animals today ?
yes .
were there any other specific ones that she may have known the names of or .
just the dog .
i don't think she'd recognize any other names but .
she kind've when we say dog and like she'll look around and look for our dog .
so .
but that that might've been it i don't think she would recognize any of these other ones .
the none of the zoo animals ?
haven't e well we haven't really gone over .
those maybe the duck .
like we you know kind of gone over farm animals with her .
but none of these other ones yet .
okay .
and which ones do you which one do you think is her what do you think was her favorite book today ?
this one definitely this one .
with the touching .
shh she's usually not interested in books .
at all .
but if she has they're like more interactive ones .
and this one has something she could touch .
and do you have any of these books at home ?
we have the foot book .
and we have good night moon not this exact good night moon .
but .
i don't know how often she's heard them .
probably not .
enough for her to like remember it .
you know maybe i don't a handful of times she's into foot book .
so because what happens is we have a three year old .
so isabelle .
watch that .
isabelle gets stuck whatever sophi with whatever we're doing with sophia .
she kind of .
that's what her activity is .
okay .
so .
that's nice .
how about this activity playing like .
the peek a because she knows peek a boo .
isabelle let me .
what are you doing sorry .
excuse me .
back here sweetie .
there you go .
she really loves peek a boo .
so having so even when we just say peek a boo .
hold on .
i know .
look there's so many things here for you to play with .
even us just saying peek a boo she gets a big smile on her face so .
i don't know if she quite understood that you know that the flaps up were peek a boo but .
she liked hearing it .
kept her entertained .
if you hadta name one item that was a lot different from last time that she played with this time what would that be ?
probably .
this .
and she seemed really interested in this .
but she didn't have much .
i don't think she had much interest in last time .
and like just any of the i guess really any of the stuffed animals like just .
putting them up to her and she'd hug them .
she'd smile .
but last time she didn't really do that .
you think it was more the the names or the sound effects ?
the pra my sound effects .
i think so .
okay .
but i don't think she'd like would have really understand the recognized frog versus bee .
do you have babydolls at home ?
we do .
yes .
but she .
i don't know i've never seen her play with a babydoll .
so they're her sister's babydolls .
okay .
so but i've never seen her play with them .
she's not into them yet .
no .
not yet .
okay .
alright and is there i think we probably asked this last time but so is there a toy that seems to match her personality the most ?
out of these or just in general ?
out of these .
mama .
fits here personality ?
mama .
mom .
i mean .
the stuffed animals i mean she's a really cuddly baby .
so i think she likes .
she likes to give hugs .
so i think being able to hug the stuffed animals .
that's .
isabelle .
that kind of fits her .
her personality .
okay .
okay i think that is it wait .
so do you think she prefers the toys over the books ?
yes .
she doesn't at home i we probably don't .
read to her as much as we should we might get like one of these books in a day to her .
which is like .
she likes that .
which is like maybe you know these books take like ten fifteen seconds to read you know ?
so .
you know i she's i feel like she's just not as exposed .
right .
to books .
but this stuff is like laying around our house .
because we have a play kitchen and so she's always like picking it up and putting it in her mouth .
okay .
you do have a play kitchen ?
we do have play kitchen .
we have the the play food not j all of these things just a few of these items .
or similar to ones we have at home .
okay .
but .
that's nice .
what is that just out of curiosity one of her favorite foods .
to eat ?
boy .
this girl will eat anything .
actually she's .
i guess her favorites just because we .
feed it to her a lot .
like baby like the corn casserole that comes in the baby jars .
the oatmeal cereal that's for babies .
she liked that .
she likes cheese .
likes crackers .
actually i haven't found anything that she does not like .
nice .
and so we i mean we're pretty much feeding her the scope of you know .
pretty much everything we ever have .
isabelle you can't play with that .
so maybe the next visit she'll she'll recognized the food .
maybe .
maybe we should probably start showing her the foods .
that we're like feeding her maybe she'll pick up pick up on it .
isabelle .
well we we really appreciate you working with us .
absolutely .
if you could just do me a favor .
sure .
today is june fifteenth two thousand nine and her date of birth is seven eighteen eight .
i appreciate it .
no problem .
so .
what did she seem most interested in today ?
the ice cream cone .
without a doubt .
any idea why ?
i think .
the the texture them on those gums .
plus it's just a good shape for her hand to grasp on to .
was she interested in any of the other foods ?
a little bit into the pizza .
again, you know, it's got that texture on it, and it's it's a nice size for her little hands, but, but .
she was really into those ice cream cones today .
and she liked the kangaroo .
that's the puppet .
she likes puppets a lot .
do you like puppets maggie ?
it's interesting to me, because my other daughter .
is, and always had been, since .
she was maybe two to three months old .
huge book fan .
so i would think .
that .
because that she'd have .
tremendous language skills, but she's actually very speech delayed .
and this one really could care less about books .
but her babbling and everything else like that is developing at a much more normal schedule .
i guess you never know .
no, well i mean, you know it'll, i think .
when they're older the book worm will probably have a better vocabulary .
but as far as the development of the language it hasn't made a bit of difference .
do you have any of these play foods at home ?
we do, but they haven't been of interest to the kids yet .
they just came at christmas time, so .
they're still into other things .
yah, i mean we've got some puppets .
puppets and plush toys are the popular things in our house right now .
and we've got the karen katz books and dr seuss .
so those were all very familiar and she didn't pay any attention at all to those .
does she use utensils .
she has she tries to use her spoon .
yah .
mostly she just plays with her spoon .
i can see that maggie .
are any of these foods that she likes when they're real ?
peas, she likes peas .
she's never seen as peas .
she sees them as mushy green globs .
really she hasn't seen much of anything .
well she had some pasta .
last night with some some ground up sauce in it .
so this kind of looks dinner last night .
and she played with that for a moment .
i'm sure she's sandwiches .
well she gets waffles too .
but she sees them as little pieces .
so i don't know that that would register .
anything else .
no, she probably doesn't see as it appears like that .
what animals did you .
i heard you guys playing with some of the animals .
yah, we played with the otter .
and we played with .
with the zebra and the kangaroo .
we played with the baby .
she loves the babies in her daycare classroom .
and she's much bigger than they are .
she sort of steam rollers them .
but she just wants to love them and kiss them .
and hug them .
and that's what she tried to do with that one .
it looked a bit like c p r .
do you guys have a lot of stuffed animals at home ?
yah, she likes those a lot .
and she her sister's baby dolls .
she likes those a lot .
she likes to just sort of drag them by the arm around the room .
do you want to be .
dragged by your arm around the room maggie ?
nope, she just wants to me in charge .
what do you have ?
is that the spaghetti ?
spaghetti .
spaghetti .
yah .
usually it takes them a while to learn to say that one .
yah .
that's a big one .
i think my brother was saying until he was six or seven .
yah .
let's just call it pasta .
that's easier .
pasta .
okay maggie .
turn everything off we are all done .
which of the toys do you think was her favorite ?
probably this bee .
she liked the .
whatever it is the sticky kind of .
no .
which do you think she liked the least ?
probably the books .
i tried to get her interested in the books .
and she didn't really .
so do you think she likes more .
what do you think she likes more ?
the toys or the books ?
probably toys .
she reads like .
or she doesn't read .
but she plays with her books at home .
but she has a shorter attention span with them .
probably not .
we have like the little stuffed animals and the books .
but we don't have any of the like kitchen toys .
and she has baby dolls .
but she doesn't play with them yet .
do you think she recognizes any of like the food items ?
probably not .
she's still .
on like baby food and formula .
so we don't really give her any food .
and we usually eat when she's down for her nap unless we're out so .
she might recognize that bottle with the orange juice or whatever it is .
does she have any dolls ?
she doesn't really play with them yet .
they're just kind of .
hanging out in her room .
she plays wi a lot with like the teether rings .
sometimes she'll eat them .
but sometimes she'll just bang them around on stuff .
and she likes to play she has a stuffed elmo .
and she loves to play with that and like talk to him .
like she's talking to winnie the pooh .
and she likes to play with .
she likes rattles a lot .
stuff that make noise .
she likes that kind of stuff .
i think the keys were probably the thing that grabbed her attention the most .
like she has a set of keys at home .
but i don't think really any of the other toys made enough noise for her to even .
notice .
no .
this is pretty much .
how she is .
we have two dogs at home though that kind of sit and hang out with her .
and she plays with them too .
but this is pretty much how she is at home so .
sounds good .
okay .
giovanna can play with him a little bit .
so do you think there were particular toys that he liked more ?
he liked the bee .
why do you think that is ?
he likes soft things on his face especially .
and i think this really interesting texture was interesting to him .
i know if i put my hair on his face he loves it .
of course then he grabs it .
but he loves it .
maybe not quite such a good thing to do here .
but no he likes he likes soft textures .
and he likes kind of funky textures so .
i noticed you tended to go toward the stuffed animals .
and so did he not like say the food items ?
do you play with any food items at home or ?
no we're mostly soft stuff still .
because he'll grab something especially if it's got an edge and just do it real quickly .
so i don't want him to .
it's more of a safety .
safety thing .
going with the soft stuff ?
yup .
were there any one toys that you thought he particularly didn't like ?
no we didn't try very many of them .
i just picked to what we generally play with at home so .
but i don't think there was anything he disliked .
are there particular ones of these that you actually do have yourself ?
i don't see anything familiar .
i mean we have stuffed toys but .
but not those particular toys .
and we have a book like this but .
does he generally prefer books or toys ?
or does he play a bunch with books ?
he plays with books .
and daddy reads to him every night .
but he just kind of sits there .
like he doesn't really play with them .
we've got mostly feely type ones and popup books and stuff like that .
but he he prefers toys and things that dangle .
what about dolls ?
do you have any ?
no we don't have any .
i think there's one in daycare .
one of the girls at daycare have * one .
but we don't have .
and that's not something that's ever interested him ?
some kids really get into babies .
no not not yet .
it seemed like he was struggling to get to things .
well that's something we do at home too is we put things kind of far away .
so he hasta work to get to them .
because we're working on moving and you know locating and crawling and stuff like that and direction driven driven .
you know if he wants it he hasta go get it .
so if we're home we actually if he wants his pacifier we'll put it just out of his reach .
and we'll make him you know kind of crawl to get for get to it .
and sometimes he decides he doesn't want it and goes off to another .
which is fine too because we're not he likes his pacifier .
we you know we don't care either way .
i don't want a two year old with a pacifier so haha .
but mostly just getting him to .
to move and to .
and to to put the .
if i go get something .
and then it's over there then it's over here .
then he can go get it .
are there particular books .
you said that your husband read to him every night .
are there like favorites in the family ?
doctor seuss .
he like hop on pop and fox in socks and a couple of those .
i think daddy prefers those more than he does but haha .
i think my husbands favorite book is still fox in socks so .
you seem to be getting into that now ?
okay .
you seem to be getting into that now ?
haha you going to start crawling ?
he gets up !
then he goes down .
but he does the army crawl .
okay i'm going to ask you some questions then .
okay .
you want to stand up so she can't get your clipboard ?
okay so what toys do you think she liked the most ?
she really liked the spaghetti especially since there were two and they matched .
i don't if she had seen the the placemats she would have liked those too because she's really into .
things being the same .
see look two !
see look at that !
bang !
do you have any like play food toys at home ?
no not that she plays with .
we have lots of books .
we have some stuffed animals but she mostly ignores them .
her favorite toys are like puzzle toys and s like squish if you've heard of that .
its kinda three dimensional sort of thing .
she likes putting things in and taking things out of her shape sorter .
i mean she doesn't she has a really simple shape sorter that has an open thing in the front and then .
it has shapes on the sides .
and she'll try to put things in the sides but she can't get but .
she likes her stacking rings .
she likes .
anything she can bang .
yes i know they're two and they're the same !
isn't that cool ?
as you see she matches .
does she have any of these books at home ?
she has .
she has mister brown can .
she has foot book .
she has put me in the zoo .
do we have baby ?
no we don't have baby .
we have other ones by the same author that look very similar but not baby .
she has good night moon but not good night moon one two three .
and she i don't think we have any touching books .
does she have any of the stuffed animals ?
none of those stuffed animals .
i mean we have some but she mostly ignores them .
she's not terribly interested in them .
do you think she would recognize body parts ?
absolutely .
well as you saw she grabbed the nose whenever i told you told her to grab the nose .
delia !
you're too busy banging .
you're not going to do it are you ?
she knows nose, mouth, eyes, .
cheek .
sometimes she'll grab ear .
sometimes she'll blow you off .
she knows body parts .
she knows hand .
foot .
does she have any dolls at home ?
no as you saw that would terrify her .
she was looking .
i know it was a scary baby .
its dead !
who put that dead baby here ?
what did she like the most ?
but the spaghetti during the official time .
she liked the spaghetti a lot .
because like i said their are two they match so .
and she could bang matching things together which is awesome .
you find two things that match and you bang them together right ?
yes that's right !
what would you say she liked the least ?
the baby .
i think abject terror was definitely dislike .
do you think she likes books or toys the most ?
it depends on what mood she's in .
these things here she'd probably tire of most the things pretty quickly unless except for the matching stuff .
but i mean i i she she crawls over to books any time she sees them .
and .
pats them and then eats them but .
she adores books .
she'll she'll even like .
if if her older brother's being read to or if he's reading to her she'll sit in somebody's lap and just spaz out over the book so .
no cause we never do that with her .
i'm sure she doesn't .
besides what sound does a deer make ?
that's right you found a fun toy didn't you ?
now that they've stopped officially counting .
no they had two of them and you could bang them .
does she have any of these toys at home ?
no no .
any similar like texture or .
no we don't have any thing really like .
we have colored plastic shapes and wooden and wooden shapes of all sorts .
because you know in general she's very shape focused so you know .
okay .
if you don't mind i wanted to ask a couple of questions .
about .
the play session .
let's see .
you !
which toys do you think that .
he liked the most ?
he seemed to like the dog a lot .
i do not know that's cause it's the first one or .
heehee .
what what haha ?
where there any that you found that he .
disliked .
not really .
he he did his typical .
thing with the book where sometimes we come up with pictures .
and other times he just wants it closed .
and just eats around haha .
so .
do you think that ?
do you think that he likes toys or books ?
it depends on .
the time of day and .
how .
alert .
he is how tired he is .
really ?
seems to .
or it .
maybe it's just our routine and what i'm .
usually doing .
with him .
i don't usually sit and try to read books with him .
unless his brother's napping .
because it's just .
too difficult .
so .
are there any specific books at home ?
you have similar ?
but we .
go to the library and we've .
lots of like board books .
do you ?
play .
like activities and do you guys do anything ?
or games or .
not planned .
just kinda spread out .
right .
haha .
haha .
nothing .
ha .
nothing .
we're not doing preschool or anything .
i know .
i know .
i thought .
the food items .
here .
do you think he recognized any of them ?
no !
you couldn't imagine .
no .
well everything he gets is pureed .
right now .
so .
it doesn't look like .
that i mean he he's been eating peas for days on end .
but .
heehee .
i don't i don't think there's any recognition at all .
we don't even know .
what really peas look like .
right .
and then any stuffed animals ?
maybe that he ?
recognized ?
he's seen dogs before .
and maybe that's why he .
preferred or seemed to prefer that over the frog .
or seemed more interested .
he hasn't see frogs haha .
so .
but we have a couple of .
different dog .
animals as well as you know .
friends have .
real dogs .
so .
okay .
we didn't really .
try anything else .
do you think that .
do you guys play with dolls maybe or .
ha .
not at the moment .
we kind of rotate .
the toys out .
so .
we we have one .
baby doll and .
she's been .
or he whoever .
it has been packed up .
okay .
so .
okay .
i think .
let me try to think what else you may have played with .
here .
you did choose to play with that book as opposed to .
these was that was that just the closest one ?
it was .
sorry about that .
that was the it was the closest one .
we do have doctor seuss books but not .
board books .
so they wouldn't be ones i would think .
for him .
because he's all about .
crinkling .
mashing .
haha so .
i don't want to do that with the .
older books .
typically at this age right ?
and they go in his mouth .
so .
the other books it hasta be a board book or a plastic .
you know .
because otherwise it's just destroyed .
and then i guess he was playing with the keys and .
we played .
a little bit .
did you think he recognized ?
i don't know .
i don't know if he recognizes or if it's just easy to hold onto .
ha .
he does have a few things that have rings .
and i guess .
in a large sense he does have his own .
keys like they don't look anything like keys to me but they're supposed to be .
you know .
keys on a ring haha .
so .
he could be .
you're into peanut butter ?
alright well i think .
i think that's it i think we got through .
everything .
i really appreciate your time .
coming in .
sure .
thanks .
well okay we're going to do the questions again .
the cookie was far superior to all the other toys .
really ?
cookie is the winner .
cookie's the winner .
okay so she was interested in the foods i guess overall ?
i think the plastic food toys were the ones i mean she did grab the book first but she went to the cookie and that was her thing .
okay okay so same questions which toy would you say is a good toy for her personality .
or the best toy .
the cookie .
okay what about which did she seem least interested in ?
the book .
i mean she grabbed it but then she wasn't interested she didn't want to read the book .
okay .
i mean she kinda wanted she want it and then realized there were other things that were better to chew on and .
okay .
so did she look at the animals you said .
a little bit she spent some time with the frog and with the donkey and spent a little time with them and then went back to the food stuff .
okay .
so would you say she's interested in books or toys or is it still the same thing too early to say ?
she's interested in both books and toys today she preferred toys .
okay .
alight .
but at home sometimes she prefers the books you know it just depends on her mood .
okay i think we answered all the questions before but is there anything different about the way she plays at home ?
did you want to tell us or baby toys or anything ?
no .
nope ?
she spends more time on her back playing with a toy up like this .
okay .
than her sister does .
she i mean as you can see she plays on her stomach also .
but a lot of times she'll just be on her back and she'll hold a toy up and play with it like that .
okay .
well i think that is it then .
okay .
okay .
participant five eight three seven today is nine fifteen two thousand nine .
where you going ?
absolutely !
so what do you think she liked to play with today ?
the doll and the keys have been her fascination today .
what ?
how was she playing with them ?
how were you engaging her to play ?
the doll i'm not sure she was getting .
the doll was confusing .
she kinda wanted to play with it but seemed frustrated with it .
so just kinda talking to her about what she had .
of course everything that goes to the mouth .
so the keys were great because it's teething time so any toy that goes to the mouth is a fabulous toy .
yes ?
now you found the mic .
i was waiting for that .
trying to show her just a couple different things .
just so so she saw what was around .
but she tended to go back to those few .
mostly the doll the key .
a little bit of the food .
right ?
would you think she picked out particular like colors of keys or do you think it would ?
no .
i think it just she found what it was the blue one and i guess just something grabbed her eye on that one .
but i don't think it was color related .
no .
i don't .
because we didn't realize there were other ones till the last couple minutes .
right ?
you said that she played with some of the food items ?
were there some that you think that she's beginning to recognize the names of or do you think she was attracted to some items that have the colors ?
i don't think it was recognition of food from home .
would it be the colors ?
or just .
i would say vicinity but it's not vicinity because she can get around .
i do not know if it's the shape ?
to fit in your hand well ?
what would we say ?
you know it tended to be the brighter colors so maybe it is c maybe colors .
you're making me work here .
think about this .
i'm sorry .
no it's okay it's fine .
do you have pretend food at home ?
no .
and she doesn't have a big doll like that so i was thinking i might have to go get a doll for her because she's got two brothers at home older brothers so most of the toys are not what most people would say girly toys .
so there is one babydoll in the house but i don't think it's even out where she would be able to find it and play with it .
so it made me think i might needta go get her something like that because she seemed to gravitate right towards that one .
but no .
no food .
that's not true .
we do have fake food but not like kid food .
we have fake like fruit .
big size regular fruit food but .
they don't know about that .
okay .
so she probably doesn't you were saying that she probably doesn't recognize any of those foods from the foods at ho .
or the names of it .
or even the look i guess .
probably not .
i mean do we have pizza at home ?
yes we eat pizza but she's not exposed to it .
a plate maybe .
but again you're not using plates .
well you're using a bowl but it's not that not that close to you .
so i don't i don't think it's recognition yet i don't think it's familiar .
probably more like the shape and texture maybe of the jars ?
like put them together or .
no the jars might be more similar just like just of the toys the shape at home .
and it fits in her mouth so .
is that funny ?
because what do you play with at home ?
you play with you play with a lot of big kid toys .
i know .
you play with she plays with a lot of cars .
she plays with .
she plays with her brothers' cars .
right ?
it's mostly actually the boys stuff upstairs not yours .
so it is yours .
i know .
i'm sorry i wiped your noise .
not nice .
not nice thing to do mom .
how about did you play with any of the stuffed animals ?
i tried to play a little bit with the word world ones but she was not into it .
she wanted to go back the keys or the doll .
so .
a couple times i tried to change them to the the stuffed animals or the book and she just .
didn't want those .
wasn't interested in those today .
i'm sorry you said she has stuffed animals at home ?
no .
i i was just trying to bring them in today to change her .
the toys she was playing with just to kinda show her other things .
so we did i grabbed these and i grabbed this one .
and then i grabbed a book and wasn't too in into those too much .
now we do the stuffed animals that he will play with smaller things like this .
not this one but like a little stuffed animal .
have you begun to like introduce their names ?
do you think that she recognizes what some of the animals would be if you produced them ?
no .
no ?
no .
okay .
absolutely not .
one because like i said she doesn't really play with them and i just i don't she's gotten the concept .
i think she's starting to recognize maybe when we talk about like sitting down to eat .
and i think she recognizes when we talk about like the family .
a little bit .
but i don't think she's at that at that point yet .
and maybe i'm underestimating you but i don't think you do .
i don't .
i don't .
so you you said you guys looked at some books ?
do you have some of these books at home ?
we have put me in the zoo .
we have the foot book but we have them in the bigger versions .
she's never seen this one .
but we do .
we read books .
she will grab books sometimes and just kinda play with the pages .
so she is familiar with books .
yes .
so i would say you kinda recognize a book because we play with those .
right ?
not at all .
really ?
not at all .
that was wa the keys really i mean these were fascinating her .
right ?
you just like those .
that's what exactly why .
what ?
and maybe if i had shown her the book when she wasn't fascinated with the other toy .
instead of trying to change her fo to or her focus .
right ?
you had no interest in this book .
and now you're going to be interested in eating .
not today .
how about any none of the books ?
no she didn't seem to want to read this one either .
or listen .
do you play pattycake and games like that or interact with her ?
we'll do .
yes .
sometimes we do we do some .
we will do itsy-bitsy spider .
we will do abc's with sign language .
we do open shut them .
right ?
no no pattycake really .
but we'll sing the song open shut them and do the hands with it yes .
and then we do abc's and we do sign language so you can follow the hands with that .
other hand plays no .
we do little rhyming songs and .
excuse you .
we do we'll go let's see which one .
ride a horsie into town .
just be careful you don't fall down .
and that's one we like to do .
right ?
and then and our and our brothers usually get involved too .
right ?
ride a horsie into town .
just be careful you don't fall down .
so some of that kind of repetitive play .
or songs .
do you think she rec thought the doll was another baby when interacting with it ?
i was i wasn't sure .
i thought maybe .
and that's why i wasn't sure if that's why she was getting frustrated .
because it wasn't really responding to her .
so i didn't know if it was something like you know it's kinda of her size and maybe it looked familiar .
and like she would smile at it and then she'd kinda go like grunt would sound is frustrating .
so i didn't know if she like thought it was something that should be playing with her .
versus her playing with it just soley .
what is that over there ?
what is this thing ?
and so i was trying to figure out what what was going through her head .
because it was like i want you but then it was like .
you're not doing what i want you to do whatever it was that she wanted .
right ?
what is that ?
what is this ?
i mean she definitely was doing what she does to us .
she pokes at her eyes she pulls at the hair .
she grabs hair .
so like that grunt .
it's it's like she's frustrated .
so i do not know if she expects it to respond differently .
did you guys play with any of the articles of clothing or i do not know .
we took off a shoe .
or i took off the shoe .
but she had no interest in that .
she seemed to notice a band aid but .
she's really upset with it .
she's like come play with me !
come do something !
what is it you want it to do ?
do you want her to sing talk back to you ?
stand up like you do ?
let's see i don't i think she's supposed to do something different .
is it like a little baby girl ?
give you kisses ?
does she give kisses and hugs and ?
she'll just give her hugs her squeezes .
but no kisses .
you're not a yet .
that's not true .
we'll lean her over and she'll just like open her mouth and drool on you .
to give you a kiss .
and you know her brother's really love that one .
so she will .
we'll like kinda lean her in for good night kisses .
okay .
okay .
and as we talk i'm going to nurse her so i hope you don't mind .
no not at all .
sounds ?
color maybe .
sound there were no real sounds in today's toys .
it does get her attention some at home some of the noises .
what is it that attracts you to these toys ?
i mean we could talk about like the difference between some of .
like the plastic food is harder than the stuffed animals .
right .
texture .
i mean the food and i guess the key were .
i mean these were kind of .
hard and soft .
kinda squeezy .
good for teething .
and so maybe things that are just good to chew on .
i mean she probably likes that harder stuff when it all goes to the mouth .
they were the right size for her to pick up .
so to be able to grasp and hold and play with they were a good size .
so .
okay .
it actually felt different .
and i think it's one because there's such a variety right here .
and there were no other distractions which is not very typical at home .
so i was actually surprised that she wasn't more mobile .
i wa i thought she was going to kinda go around and check out other s the chairs .
or move around to other toys than actually sit fairly fairly still here .
so that kinda surprised me .
that she was actually engaged in the toys ?
well not just even i mean that she just wanted stayed in this one vicinity .
and it was all right in front of her so she didn't have to go far .
if there were because there were no other real distractions .
which you know like i said usually at home it's her brothers .
or we're i guess not sitting with her for fifteen straight minutes at a time .
which sounds bad as i say that but reality is you know it just doesn't happen as much at home .
so it was it was interesting to watch her just kinda sit here .
and play with just a couple .
and stay in a fairly small area .
does she play with each toy the same way as she would at .
does she explore them the same way or did you find yourself since it was new kind of prompting her differently or you know .
no that i mean the way she played seemed fairly simi familiar or similar that the way we do at home .
okay .
you know we talk about what she's playing with .
and then sometimes we just let her kinda go with you know without the prompts or without the the talking .
the narrative to it .
right .
so .
you know we try to kind of you know go over it's the pizza or you've got blue key .
so it's not forced .
right .
kind of let her play on her own ?
okay .
was there anything any of the items here that you think .
i know i keep asking you in different ways the same question .
it's okay .
that you think she was familiar with or even new kind of some new items that ?
well stuffed animals i would say is pretty new .
i'm what did i say the b .
sorry the babydoll .
not the stuffed animals .
books familiar .
food new .
i'm just trying to think of if it would be similar to even though we don't have food but the shape to another toy at home .
no i think they're pretty they're pretty novel for what we have .
trying to think of the toys that have been upstairs that she's been playing with a lot .
because we have a lot of blocks like square soft blocks that she plays with .
rattles .
what else do you like to play with ?
you're at your table top toy more .
so that's you know stationary .
a lot of novelty for her .
the stuffed animals even at home she doesn't play with too much .
i mean they're there .
but it's not one of her go to toys .
right .
okay so like everything could have been potentially well not everything but a lot of it could have been potentially new .
unique and kind of .
and like new like words like in i like presenting them in isolation .
this is a that kind of thing .
yes .
yes .
that funny ?
we're talking about you .
these are .
i a lot of it's probably new vocabulary when we talk about it other than colors .
colors we'll talk about .
but a lot of it would be new new words .
okay .
what are you doing ?
is there anything else that we didn't talk about that you played with today ?
i don't think so .
no .
no ?
no ?
no because we tried to play with the books but she didn't .
i i mean i thought that the stuffed animals were going to catch her attention more .
just the colors and just .
but they caught my attention .
i like them !
what do you think ?
no ?
okay .
like i said the doll .
made me think i'm going to have to go get the doll from downstairs and let her play with it a little bit more .
okay .
you're so happy now .
so much better .
okay .
well i think that that's it for today then .
okay .
haha so just in terms of the things that he did play with here what do you think interested him the most ?
it's ha it's hard to tell because he seemed to .
it's hard to tell .
i think anything he can put in his mouth really .
that's really what he cares about .
and he definitely seemed to you know once he saw this he recognized it each time it showed up so .
he seemed to like that .
he likes bright things .
you know so he was going towards the bright animals .
okay .
but i don't i don't know that he had a favorite .
i think it'd be easy to substitute .
so you think maybe the things that he could put in his mouth .
the animals he didn't so much put in his mouth .
but the things that he could hold .
i mean but he liked this a lot .
i took this away i guess .
look at that .
maybe not .
he didn't really put it in his mouth right ?
no okay .
i wonder why well i don't know .
i actually wasn't watching you too much .
he put it in his mouth a little bit .
so do you think that's why he liked it too or the color ?
or what do you think ?
well just based on the other things he likes he definitely likes the bright colors .
and able to put it in his mouth .
so it had two features ?
haha two reasons to love that one !
i see that you do .
but then if i give him this again he might just take this again .
do you have toys like any of these things at home ?
i have nothing like this box at all .
we have lots of stuff stuffed animals rattles things that you pull and they vibrate stuff like that .
so i have a basket that's about this size .
and what i'll do is sit him on the floor and put the basket in front of him .
and he'll just pull stuff out and put it back in .
but i don't play with him .
i let him do that .
but if i play with him normally what i would do is i do pattycake and this little piggy .
and i'll tickle him and .
blow on his belly .
that's the stuff what we do a lot more of .
right not so much toys per se .
not so much toys .
but more more stuff like that .
or reading or something like that .
did you i didn't see did you take a look at any of those books that we have ?
i pulled the foot book out for a moment .
and started it .
but he didn't have any interest .
haha .
is that something you have at home that one ?
no i have the good night moon at home .
but we have a couple doctor seuss in you know this size .
cool do you think he prefers books or toys or .
toys to definitely to books .
because i try and introduce books a lot .
and he doesn't .
seem to like them .
as much as i do haha .
maybe by next time .
you never know how things will change .
i think you already said he doesn't play with pretend food and .
no we don't have anything like this .
the most he'll do is when i put him in his highchair i give him plastic bowls and cups .
and so he plays with those .
he bashes them and throws them .
haha .
haha he throws them .
do you do that ?
throws them and likes to make noise ?
definitely .
i heard you make a noise !
i heard you make a noise .
it's fun isn't it ?
you can't do a lot with your voice .
do you have any dolls baby dolls or anything dolllike besides the stuffed animal type toys ?
no .
it's like teddy bear and a monkey things like that .
you have a monkey ?
that's his favorite .
really ?
that's his favorite .
it's green and blue .
and it has these hooks on the end on each of its limbs .
and so it hooks onto everything .
and he'll just play with that forever .
you mean you can put it onto like a chair ?
it's like a sea thing .
i have never seen that .
does it have like a .
is it a plastic hook ?
so it's it's a furry animal and then just its appendages are .
so you can hang it ?
so it looks like it's hanging from a tree or something ?
it's real cute .
he likes that a lot .
what do you got there ?
cheese .
let's see .
i'm not sure this applies at this particular age .
but were there any items that you think he didn't really know the name of ?
well probably he probably doesn't know the name of a lot of them .
that's what i would sort of think .
you know .
he doesn't .
i mean i don't think .
i don't think he knows the name of a lot of the stuff .
pertain more to the kids as they get older .
i thought i'd ask let's see .
and you said that he likes things that are bright colors and likes things that he can put in his mouth .
haha that's usually what ends up with the books .
so that's why he we don't do books as much because he just puts them in his mouth .
and they're made out of paper !
haha .
is there oopsies !
did you go down ?
do you want to get up ?
there you go !
there you go !
was there anything about how he likes to play that you've seen at home or here that you'd .
there you are .
that i didn't ask that would be good to know ?
what he likes how he plays that kind of stuff ?
i would i mean i think the biggest thing is if he's ever by himself it's definitely he likes different things .
he'll get bored .
and he'll go onto the next thing and go back again .
i think that's .
does he like playing by himself ?
he likes i mean i work parttime and some of the days from home .
and my babysitter didn't come on wednesday .
so i had him for the day while i was working .
and i put him on the floor with a blanket .
and he just played for a good hour .
actually which was which i was impressed with haha .
but he really is more of a .
actually i let me modify that .
he does play with himself .
but he would prefer to interact with people by far .
haha .
but he's not going to fuss every time he's by himself .
no .
that's pretty good alexander .
that's pretty good .
okay well i think .
unless there's anything that you thought of that i didn't ask about what he likes .
we'll revisit it when you come back again .
okay and i guess that's all i have to do i can turn this off .
now i just want to go over a couple questions .
okay .
i'm not going to be writing down any answers so .
that's fine .
because we have the you know you have the mic on and that kind of stuff so .
not in your mouth .
i was just wondering which of the toys you thought that raina liked the most ?
this .
the spoon ?
the spoon or i do not know .
between the spoon and the keys .
but she's determined to have the spoon how about i put it over there .
all gone .
it's all gone .
do you do you have similar toys at home ?
yes .
we have a baby doll .
we have the books and we have the keys .
we usually don't play with the spoon except when it's time to eat but we do have that at home too .
one that she bangs on .
you can't have that .
not the microphone .
no .
i didn't notice if you picked up any books .
we we read the we had this one and this one .
we have some like this at home .
does she does she like those at home ?
you know obviously .
she usually bangs the pages .
in the flip book which is what she was trying to do here .
then she put it down and saw the baby doll .
okay .
so do you think she like books more or toys more ?
i don't know .
i don't know that she has a preference .
whatever is closest to her in her line of sight is what she wants .
do you play with pretend food at home ?
no we don't .
no you don't have any of those ?
no .
but dolls ?
she has a doll .
i have a three year old niece so they each have to have their own doll because she has a baby and she wants the baby so .
it's a little baby for her .
so she knew what the baby was .
funny .
do you think raina recognize any foods ?
i know that you were presenting her with some foods .
i don't think so .
say i have eaten any of that stuff yet .
keys .
and do you think she recognize any animals ?
the names of any animals ?
no .
which names do you think out of everything that she that you played with that she did recognize whether it be the specific names ?
i don't know .
we have a book similar to this with the ducks on it which is why i pulled out the duck book .
and we have a bee book at home and so i pulled out the bee to play .
we have a book about that at home so .
those are the ones that i pulled out just because .
we read about those .
see like she wants that one because we have one like that at home .
the farm book .
do you .
sorry .
no go ahead .
do you play ?
peekaboo ?
you do ?
i thought she might like the book .
she wants to close the pages .
that's what she does at home .
i have an and you lift up the flap and there's a picture of the baby on the inside .
we open the flap peekaboo .
but she didn't play .
she just closed the book she wants to hold it .
well she wants eat them all .
and i guess the last question i noticed when we came in you said you have this clock at home but you didn't .
no we didn't play well because we have it at home so .
i was like they have other let's play with all the other stuff they have .
we don't have this book or that .
that's funny .
we have something similar but not the same .
okay well great i think that's pretty much it unless you wanted to comment .
do you have any questions about anything ?
no .
it was fairly enjoyable .
like she seems malleable enough .
alright .
we're good ?
i just have a few questions to ask you actually .
but he can keep playing .
okay well for him right now playing is just putting everything in his mouth .
that's how he's learning .
and those two teeth coming through the bottom everything .
so just which toys do you think were the most interesting for him to play with ?
and which ones do you think fit his personality the best ?
i mean toys that he's really into right now are block toys that if i build up he can knock them down which is why i started stacking the cans .
but otherwise it's stuff that's just easily he can hold easily and put in his mouth .
so i mean what he went for once i put them out were these cookies which are really wet and disgusting and the peas .
you're giving them to me thank you !
and i think he arto automatically recognized books because we read books a lot but .
ew .
he doesn't play with plush animals very much so put because everything is going in his mouth .
those you think would interest him the least out of all the toys we have here ?
would interest him the least ?
it's probably the the stuffed an or the big baby doll .
he wouldn't know what to do with the big baby doll .
we haven't played with them at all .
okay so do you guys have pretend food at home ?
no we don't ha .
i mean because he's not really doing pretend play yet .
so most of his toys are more sensory right now .
so things that he can touch and eat and make noise and things like that .
so no he doesn't have any pretend food .
so what types of toys do you guys play with at home besides .
you said you have sensory .
well he has blocks .
he has a piano that he he pats and it makes noise .
he has like some shape sorters that have like different holes and he that he can take things out and put them in .
look at you rolling !
he has like a sound like entertainment board thing .
so mostly things like that .
he can roll over !
he's not crawling yet though .
do you think that he recognizes any of the types of food that you would have here ?
no i mean his food is all mush .
and we don't necessarily really eat in front of him because we eat after him .
so would he recognize the food ?
not really .
okay .
he recognized the spoons i think though .
those he recognized .
yes you do have big teeth coming in .
judy did you have any questions ?
do you have any well just i don't know i saw you playing some little thing .
do you have any like routine kinds of play peekaboo or any of those .
one of the things we've been doing a lot lately .
for christmas he just got these kind of squishy stacking blocks .
so i stack up the blocks .
and i count them up .
and then he knocks them over .
and then usually he's chewing on one at the time .
and he'll use the one that he has in his hand to knock it over .
he does play peekaboo .
he likes it best when we cover his head .
and he pulls the the cloth off .
and then we all cheer .
so the one two three that was part of the like stacking .
that's what we do .
that's a fun game !
that's a fun game !
he's he's just figured out that he can roll to get places .
so he's been doing that a lot lately .
you're sharing with me ?
he just started flipping on the changing table too .
haha which is not very fun .
that's not a good idea .
so i think that's all .
easy enough .
i would probably get rid of get rid of that .
okay .
so which of the toys did he seem to be the most interested in ?
the peas .
okay .
why do you think why do you think that is ?
he tried to put it in his mouth .
okay .
if you have to pick a toy that you would say is good for his personality what would you pick ?
good for his personality .
and why .
well .
i mean .
i don't know .
that's that's an interesting question .
i didn't really think about it .
vocalizes .
i'd say he's least interested in the book .
although with my first son he would love to be read to at this age .
and he will a little bit .
like he tolerated a few .
pages but .
so that's the least like him .
i .
i think he liked .
i think he liked making sound from the from the plastic pieces by tapping them together .
so i think that was something he could do something with .
okay .
you know because the book and the animal they're kind of they don't .
really do anything .
so that's why i think he he was like wanting to do something .
okay .
which of the toys did he seem to be the least interested in and why ?
i think .
the book or the zebra .
okay .
just because they like you said they don't make .
they don't make a sound or they don't they're kind of you know they're there .
i don't know if he if he understands that me reading the book is .
do you know what i mean ?
like if that's if that's what i'm doing .
i don't know if he gets that .
okay .
do you think does he have a certain type of book that he prefers for you to read ?
no .
i mean because we have we have that one at home for example .
and we have something similar .
we have a lot of these we have a lot of of baby books like board books .
he just doesn't seem .
that into it .
at this point .
do you think there's any of these items that he recognizes the name for ?
i kind of doubt it .
although we ha .
maybe book .
but i i don't know .
i kinda .
i don't know .
that's a good question .
what about some of the eating .
utensils ?
the spoon he might .
but that's not the kind of spoon that he he's fed with .
we do have play dishes at home .
he mi .
i'm trying to look at the animals .
he might recognize an animal name .
but .
maybe not with those animals because they're kinda specific .
maybe frog .
i don't know .
okay .
do you have any of these toys at home ?
you mentioned the book .
we have books .
we have play dishes .
i haven't usually let him play with the play dishes per se .
but he plays with things that are like .
similar .
he has he ha .
and right now he's he's cutting teeth .
so like .
hello .
things that he can chew on i think he prefers just now beca .
but he has he has a little a little keyboard that he likes to play .
he has .
you know sort of those those .
i don't know what you call them .
like they're like cloth teethers that have the sort of .
like the the legs and stuff on them have like a plastic piece or a rattle piece or whatever .
so there's he has different ones of those that he likes .
does he ever play with dolls ?
i don't think we have a .
doll .
we ha .
we have like the soft blocks .
and we have those big the big fat you know like the duplo type blocks .
and we have things that .
we have stuffed anim stuffed animals and things like that .
but i'm trying to think if he actually has a doll .
i don't think he actually has a a quote unquote like baby doll .
i don't think he has one at this point .
okay .
okay i think we are done for today .
okay .
i was going to say it's not a it's not a it's not a bias thing in the sense of .
no no .
you know ?
i would let him play with a doll if he shows an interest in it .
i don't care about that .
so tell me about how you guys played and what you played with .
what we played with ?
it looked like she gravitated to the food items and i think because of the colors .
she really likes the colors .
and maybe the soft .
texture of it .
but it was hard enough to bite on it because she's teething so .
she kept going after these little slices of pizza she liked that a lot .
i kept trying to introduce her to the different stuffed toys .
she wasn't interested at first .
she hadta do that first .
and then after a while she was kind of okay with the bumblebee .
and she liked him because he was having interaction with her and kissing her and bumping up against her .
and we do that a lot at home with stuffed toys .
and we read a lot but she likes to eat the pages so .
she got frustrated with me .
because she wasn't able to eat the page .
and that you saw she was getting a little fussy because of that .
but normally we do .
we sing the abc song like all day long .
so she's familiar with that when she hears it .
she hops her head up .
and sometimes she plays in her play pen at home .
and i just throw a bunch of things in there and she just kinda plays with them independently .
so i'm used to she's not used to me playing like this much with her this long .
because i think i i com i'm irritating her a little bit .
she'd rather just do her own thing .
that's kinda her personality .
are any of the food items familiar things from home ?
they have play food at home it's not these items specifically .
but she doesn't really play with those because they're in our play room and she's too small to really go in there so i don't she may have seen them before though .
but she doesn't they're not the same stuff .
they're a little harder .
they're more like this .
the plastic one .
they're thicker .
do you use some of the names at home ?
the names of the food at home ?
pizza .
she's probably heard us talking about pizza night or whatever because she has a brother that loves pizza .
and .
that goes to mommy's .
you have all these toys and you want the microphone .
i mean she's not really eating a lot of things yet but she's probably heard us talking t about them and then i'm saying them as we're playing like spaghetti and icecream .
what about is she starting to use like forks and spoons ?
no she's eating with her fingers she's eating finger foods a lot .
she eats like cheerios and fruit puffs and stuff like that .
but she's familiar she's watched this show on tv with her siblings .
the word world i think it's called .
so this is probably looks a little familiar with her .
does she know that the animal names ?
some of them or would they be familiar with to her ?
zebra ?
maybe .
i mean i'm sure she's heard it before on the shows .
any of the other animals she might be familiar with ?
so she's probably heard dog before .
bumblebee .
that's why i grabbed these two .
mostly because of their color but she's she's seen those before .
she's familiar with winnie the pooh .
and she knows about hello kitty .
because her entire bedroom is decorated that way .
she's never seen it in yellow though .
she might not totally know that that's hello kitty yet .
sweetie pie .
and then i heard you were playing with the food kind of like imaginary play .
is that something that you do at home ?
i do that with everything .
with her at home .
and everything i typically if i have her on my hip when we're walking around the house and doing different things .
i'm naming everything i'm picking up .
okay .
so she starts to get familiar with spoon .
when i was holding the spoon i kept saying it .
and the daughter that's two actually was talking at twelve months very very fluently .
like you could understand everything and she was really clear .
and it's probably because i did that with her .
so .
she's kinda saying some things already .
this one .
that's exciting .
so she'll probably be that way as well .
kennipoo i can't have you put it in your mouth and go fer far back in your mouth because you're going to choke sweet pea .
how did you decide what to make to use for the imaginary play like the objects ?
i was watching her .
you know just seeing what she kept gravica gravitating to .
she wanted the food .
i kept introducing the books and she's like not right now .
and i tried to bring a t stuffed toy and she would like not really pay much attention to it .
now she's a little more open i think .
she's u she's bored with the food i think .
so now she's looking at the other stuff .
but i was following her lead .
which food items were her favorite ?
i think the pizza .
she picked up the spaghetti a little bit .
and then the icecream cone .
and she gnawed on it .
i hope these are clean .
we actually clean them after every visit .
okay .
and she liked the cookie .
because it probably because of the colors .
and it was easy to pick it up .
were you bringing in other names for what they could be ?
certain things ?
just kind of like .
i called them what they are .
okay .
yep .
i want her to learn it the right way .
i told her that these were both spaghetti even though i'm not sure if they are .
one looks totally different than the other one but .
kennedy honey that's you keep going after and you can't have that .
that's going to get jabbed in your throat .
how about the books ?
which ones did you .
i was trying to show her this yellow one because she likes yellow she tends to gravitate to the color yellow s because it's nice and bright and cheerful i think .
and she touched the little fur for a second .
but she's her attention span when reading is not quite there .
so we can get through a couple of pages but she really just wants to eat it .
and and play with the pages .
so that's usually what i let her do with books .
but i read every night to the other ones and she's usually sitting right there .
sometimes she's really attentive to it .
she's actually listening .
at least it looks like it .
do you have any of the same books at home ?
i have a lot of doctor seuss books i don't have that one though .
i think i the foot book looks familiar .
and i have a book very similar to this one on the farm .
it's not quite this one but it's very similar to this .
and it's got the thick pages like that .
this is the first time i've seen the peekaboo book that's cute .
but she would rip this one .
because it's not really thick .
but .
how did she do with it today ?
she did fine i got through it but she kept trying to you know eat the pages .
was there a page that she maybe you thought or she did think was particularly exciting ?
she liked this curtain page .
and maybe because it split in two and she could grab it easier .
this one .
she didn't really care what was under it she was more or less con interested .
i'm sorry honey .
she was more or less concerned about the actual .
sweetie .
are you enjoying yourself ?
are you enjoying yourself ?
what you think baby girl ?
you're probably getting a little hungry ?
you call her a couple different names right ?
other than i mean just like nick names sweet names ?
you know it's just natural i don't even know what i'm calling her half the time .
sweet pea honey .
pumpkin .
kennipoo .
mostly kennipoo .
don't you .
you think that's your name don't you ?
you think kennipoo's your name ?
i did not even pick up the babydoll .
i thought she might be afraid of it it's kinda big .
i didn't even see this one actually .
this is as big as you !
you like it ?
you think it's another baby .
you like to pull hair there you go .
you say why is she letting me do this ?
that's a that's a very fun thing that she's just letting you do everything you want to do .
you like her hair ?
you like her eyes aren't they pretty ?
does she have pretty eyelashes ?
you bless god bless you !
you sneezed in the baby's face .
say excuse me .
excuse me .
so if you hadta pick like her favorite thing today to play with what do you think it wa .
or things it doesn't necessarily have to be one but .
she seems very interested in this one .
maybe i should have pulled out the babydoll sooner .
she liked that bumblebee .
she seemed to have a lot of reaction to it once she finally decided she was going to be okay with stuffed toys .
but she liked the .
kennedy okay honey you're pulling her hair out .
look at you took the baby's hair out .
kennipoo .
you took her hair out !
it's okay .
she's alright honey .
it's alright .
it's okay .
you want to still play with her ?
so you held the bee and you were you were pretend playing with the bee like the bee was kissing her ?
that's not mommy's .
you have hair all over the place little one .
poor little babydoll .
i think she bit his nose .
she tried to kiss him or whatever she does with him .
she has this thing with faces .
what's wrong you're getting hungry ?
you're getting hungry ?
what would you say was something you were trying to get her that she was was her least favorite thing ?
her least favorite thing ?
probably these toys words .
these she wasn't interested in pooh today which was surprising .
she didn't want that .
she was really not really all that interested in the books .
other than wanting to bite them .
what do you want to play with ?
does she have like a favorite color ?
she likes yellow .
she definitely likes yellow .
and that seems to be what she's gravitated to even today .
are there any colors that you find that she doesn't gravitate toward ?
her least favorite ?
i do not know i never really paid attention to that .
okay .
okay i think that's it for today .
got plenty to ?
to be interested in .
good .
well of the toys that we have here and the things we have here .
what do you what would you say interested her the most ?
the play food .
the play food .
okay .
by far .
and do you think there is anything about her .
her personality .
how she is that that accounts for that or ?
not particularly .
i think potentially it could be its .
well i was going to say browns not all that colorful .
but it's a kind of toy she's never seen before .
we don't have any .
where as we have stuffed toys we have books .
so .
so this stuff .
she hasn't you don't have at home and the dishes .
the food any of that stuff you don't have at home ?
right .
okay .
that's definitely novel .
got it .
that is really interesting .
and so .
what do you think out of these things interested her the least ?
at least today ?
today .
the books .
today the books .
okay .
says it now been there done that ha .
she has a lot of books at home ?
we do lots of reading and .
playing and opening .
and her dad has now taught her how to open books and .
so .
does she like to turn the pages turn pages by herself when you're reading to her or ?
she's not quite there yet .
but .
she does instead of just going whack with the books now .
you know the one's that she knows .
she'll open .
kind of smile at .
and sort of shake and flip open to another page .
and smile at .
okay .
so she's .
but she's not you know doing the pages as we read yet .
she's kind of choosing the pace a little bit .
okay .
and of these here .
do you have any at home that are ones she might recognize from home ?
as far as exactly the same no .
i actually grabbed this book because we have a similar .
like the same brand that has the you know ducks and .
but not the exact book .
okay .
haha cookie .
you know what a cookie is already don't you ?
courtesy of daddy and mommy sorry .
how about any of the other things ?
would she recognize any of the things she's seen here ?
does she have stuffed animals like any of these ?
she actually has a little duck that's almost similar characters .
like colors as the frog .
and same size .
and she has a lot of little clothes and stuff with frogs .
and there's the baby doll .
you discovered the baby doll .
you have about just as much hair as that .
just looking around .
oddly enough these these are like the best toy ever .
on the .
highchair .
and okay she would recognize that .
yup she recognizes these .
spoons cups .
okay .
would she recognize any of the food items do you think ?
she's actually had little bits of bread .
when pierce and i have had bread .
she'd probably recognize a hamburger .
because we do cookout relatively frequently .
pizza a lot if we are ordering in .
i don't think she's actually seen us eat spaghetti .
but the pretty red and white .
and you were saying she doesn't eat peas like that ?
no she eats the mushy peas .
so .
but she loves peas .
any like green .
actually she's a big green veggie fan .
which i hear is not normal for babies .
so .
going with the fact that she loves spinach .
right .
she does .
let's see .
okay .
so she likes to play with the measuring spoon type stuff and things like ?
measuring spoons like baby food the plastic baby food containers .
she actually really likes balls .
squishy balls .
since she likes you know we'll make stuff bounce .
and just some stuff go crash .
she like to do that .
we've lately started playing with stacking cups .
and she's learned about knocking things over .
but those are sort of the preferred toy right now .
are the stacking cups .
and remote controls .
cause a lot of times we have parents mention toys that are favorites at home .
like balls .
blocks or things .
it's like the balls and the stacking cups right now .
along with you know anything .
pretty much anything that we touch .
is what she wants .
okay .
so .
the telephone she actually has a little hissy fit .
whenever i pick up the phone i don't put it on speaker phone .
she wants to she knows now that it's a conversation .
maybe .
or that mommy starts talking when she picks it up .
and knows that it's not at her .
so .
and you want wires .
and ice cream .
she's seen ice cream .
i don't think so .
but .
she's definitely into the like picking out the most dangerous thing in the room stage right now .
and how about you said she has a lot of things with frogs on them .
does she know the names of any animals ?
do you think or ?
she heard ?
she probably knows like frog duck and cat .
she definitely knows cats .
and or specific cats names .
do you have cats at home ?
okay .
but she definitely .
definitely knows the word cat .
okay .
aoife yucks .
that's really gross .
i'm sorry .
its fine .
here .
here baby baby .
yucks .
here let us do your face first .
cause that can't feel very good .
there you go .
and then dress .
good enough .
and did she have any baby dolls at home ?
just like one little squishy one .
what she interested in that at all ?
no more than any other stuffed toy .
okay .
cause just here .
at the end .
she seemed a little bit interested in that dolls face .
was one of those things .
making me think that maybe we should pick up a baby doll .
put it on the christmas list .
it's coming soon .
i know .
okay .
so she doesn't play with that so much .
how much does she play with stuffed animals at home ?
not that frequently .
they are more of like a crib .
like when she wakes up in the morning .
she has one that she likes to whack and choke .
but more mostly around the crib .
or if i'm taking a shower .
i'll plop her on the floor or do stuffed toys .
actually that's stuffed toy and book time .
so .
so that's when she would .
okay .
but if there's other things around .
she'll usually pick up .
she has this one little chicken that she likes .
do we have one ?
but like color wise you know .
with the chicken it's color wise about the same .
but with the chicken she .
you know pick him up, shake him, and set him down .
pet him a little bit and that's it .
like she's definitely more interested in the cups and .
okay .
things like that .
little harder things .
things that like honestly she's in a whacking phase right now .
so anything that she can whack .
and she's already starting to pick up like what makes good noise you know .
to her good noises and a little more satisfying whack .
that sounds about right .
well that's all the questions i have .
and if i didn't ask you anything about what she likes and doesn't .
like and how she likes to play .
you can go ahead and let me know that .
we will probably ask you very similar questions the next time .
okay .
and to see how she plays then .
okay .
just trying to think .
aoife anything ?
noise .
usually mommys a lot noisier .
that's what a lot of parents this age .
we do lots of .
yup love noise and lots of singing .
singing okay .
yup .
loves to sing .
or loves to hear me sing and she'll actually sort of sing along .
i didn't think you needed that on .
for my voice anyway on .
you do itsy-bitsy spider aoife ?
fun .
rubber ducky .
maybe next time she'll want to do .
we'll do some songs .
alright that's great .
okay .
he loves feet .
loves feet .
loves shoes .
you actually can keep that on .
i just have a few questions for you .
sure !
you don't want to eat my shoe !
yes he does .
yummy .
okay .
going to give you some .
want to hold the pizza ?
can you hold that ?
good boy .
i just have a few questions for you .
sure .
so which of the toys was he most interested in would you say ?
the fake pizza .
why why do you think that ?
his sister have a lot of fake food at home .
she has a little kitchen set .
and the food is in a bin on the floor .
and he's able to crawl to crawl to it and knock the bin over .
and get the food out of it .
so he plays with the similar stuff at home .
okay which of the toys seemed to interest him the least ?
the stuffed animals .
animals ?
doesn't really care for them .
no ?
okay .
just no interest .
they don't do anything .
they don't taste all that good .
okay would you say he prefers books over toys ?
or toys over books ?
he prefers toys over books .
okay and if you hadta pick a toy that you would say is good for his personality what would you pick and why ?
for his personality .
like in general or what you have here ?
from what we have here .
i guess the pizza because he likes it so much .
he's in a stage where he's .
well obviously sticking everything in his mouth .
and it's squishy .
and it's the right size for his hands .
and it's colorful .
okay .
and i guess the plastic doesn't taste bad .
do you think he recognizes the names for any of these items ?
he might .
he might recognize baby because he has there's a baby doll at home we play with .
and .
what about the food ?
food ?
i don't know .
i don't think he knows the specific names .
but i try and as he's interacting with things tell him what things are .
okay and let's see what else we have .
do you have any of these exact same toys at home or books or any ?
we ha the fake pasta looks like stuff we have at home .
and the icecream cone and the peas .
probably got them out of the same type of set .
we have mister brown can .
but i don't know if i've ever read it to him .
okay .
and we don't have any of the stuffed animals .
okay and then i guess you said he was recognizing .
he h well he's got a bottle .
so he was picking it up and kind of trying to suck on it the same way he does with his bottle .
and we have you know we have fake plates .
okay .
we have s fake pizza .
but it's not li it's harder plastic .
okay i think that's all we have for you today .
leave it ?
okay .
which toys did she seem to be interested in ?
the hard ones .
the foods ?
do you have any of these pretend foods at home or .
no .
what about the which ones of these was she least interested in ?
the books .
okay .
what about do you guys have any of the books at home or ?
we don't have any of these particular books .
we do have books .
alright .
does she have any of .
does she have pretend dolls at home or stuffed animals ?
we got a few of those .
do you think she'd recognize any of the foods we have ?
not yet ?
nah she's only eating purees right now .
okay .
how about the animals is there anything she recognized ?
she might've recognized pooh but other than that .
okay .
so at home would you say she prefers books or toys ?
toys .
toys .
she chews on books occasionally but .
okay i think that would be it unless there's anything you want to tell me about how she plays at home or if she has other toys ?
not really right now .
pretty much anything she can get her mouth on she's fond of .
okay .
is it okay if i ask you some questions ?
okay .
what do you think miles liked the most today ?
anything that he could chew on .
that was more firm .
as opposed to the stuffed animals .
i imagine because he's teething .
what were some of those .
like the food ?
like the waffle .
the waffle was a big hit .
the plates .
the spoon .
he enjoyed the books some too .
do you read books at home ?
well i try .
after a couple pages he usually takes them away and tries to chew on them .
how about do you have any of the same books at home or any similar themes ?
i don't think we have any of these .
we have one similar to this animal one .
it has you know touch and feel .
animals .
is he getting familiar with like animal names ?
i don't know at this point if he's made that connection yet .
it's hard to tell .
does he have any similar toys with the stuffed animals .
he does have stuffed animals .
he's got a winnie the pooh about this size .
but most of his stuffed animals are bigger .
his size ?
not quite that big .
kind of standard teddy bear size .
did did you two play with the doll at all today ?
i showed it to him and he wasn't interested and went back to chewing on the waffle .
does he have any dolls at home ?
i don't think he has any .
i don't think so .
what kinda toys does he have at home ?
like how does he like to usually play or do you usually like to play together ?
types of toys he has at home .
i mean he has story books and he has some stuffed animals .
he's not typically as interested in those .
he's got like a little ball with a jingle bell inside it and he likes .
anything he can kind of chew on he likes .
and he's got a toy phone that makes sound and talks to him .
he likes that .
but usually he's trying to get the remote control or our cellphones .
so we've given him an old cellphone and things like that .
and if we're playing together we'll often do we may not be playing with a toy per se but doing like you know the airplane game or .
more physical type things .
okay .
do you think any of the .
i'm sorry .
you're okay .
food names of the foods that are here are familiar ?
like things that you eat at home that he's heard the name of ?
peas .
he's had peas .
he might have heard pizza .
probably not waffles .
that would .
cheese i guess but he didn't play with the cheese .
did he get does he play with keys at home ?
with keys ?
i mean he's got a .
some toy keys .
toy keyring type thing .
but not really not real ones .
he'd probably like to but we don't want them lost so .
good call .
or he'd stab himself in the eye or something .
do you think the way he played today is like the way he plays at home ?
i think so .
do you usually have like the toys all spread around or .
i was going to say not nearly this many toys out at one time .
i guess it's like i mean in some ways it's similar to how he plays at home but often at home he'll play with a toy for a little bit and then he'll crawl over and pull up on the couch or .
i mean he's very into .
there aren't this many toys around .
he's very into seeing what he can find next and things to pull up on .
try to reach and grab .
you like that ?
it's a baby like you .
kind of .
you going to eat her head now ?
or his .
i can't tell .
the gender of the doll but .
it's neutral i think .
the baby's head ?
does he like thing's that make music ?
like out of like you know sound texture and color what do you think he's most attracted to ?
mostly probably to texture at this point because he's really into chewing everything .
but he does he does like things that make that play music or sounds .
that's why he likes like i've said the toy telephone that he's got .
you push buttons and winnie the pooh talks to you and stuff .
he likes that .
and he likes whatever we have of course .
are books you'd mentioned that with books it's only about like two or three pages in .
are there any books that he's more interested in than others ?
i'm not sure if he's more interested in some than others .
when you first open a book he usually gets really excited .
you know he likes to see the pictures .
i mean i guess most of the books he's looked at have animals in them .
he likes he's excited at first but then he remembers that he wants to chew on it .
do you think that like out of the books here which books had you chosen to kind of play with him .
i'm not sure if i .
i don't remember now if he grabbed either one of these or if i grabbed .
i think he grabbed this one .
like i said this is similar to what we have at home .
and this one i may have grabbed just because it's dr seuss .
i like dr seuss .
okay .
i thought he probably would too .
the like rhyming words .
right .
and the pictures are pretty .
they're pretty attractive to a baby i would think .
bright colors and happy creatures .
do you say things like body parts to him ?
like this is your foot or feet or eyes or nose or any of that at this point ?
i guess we do .
i mean it's something i haven't explicity thought of .
to some degree yes .
not you know going through them all ritualistically or anything .
i just meant since that's the foot book so i thought maybe like .
right .
we point out things like that to some degree .
do you have pets at home ?
we don't .
i mean he's been around .
his grandparents have pets .
so he's been around dogs and cats when we've visited .
but i don't know if he can categorize what's a dog yet or anything .
well i mean i often ask like what would be like familiar to them like horsie piggy something like that because at this age .
most kids haven't seen a lot of horses and .
right so i just kind of think well is it familiar as in have they heard of it ?
right .
is something is there a book on horsies that you read or something like that you know ?
right .
i guess we i guess we do have a few a couple different barnyard type animal books .
it seems to be a popular theme for baby books .
where you going ?
he's swimming on the toys .
that one wasn't squishy enough .
that's funny .
is there anything else about the session that you thought was like particularly a lot like him or not at all like him ?
nothing in particular .
i mean for playing with toys it's pretty typical of what he would do .
just he often would you know be off in some other direction too .
i think that's probably just because there are so many toys and they're all new to him so .
i do try to switch out the toys that he has out every week or so so that it keeps it more interesting for him .
that's good .
do you kind of like change the theme of the toy's too ?
i mean it's nothing that scientific about it .
just put a couple back in the toybox .
take a couple different ones out .
okay .
alright well i think that's it for today .
what ?
what do you want ?
about enough of .
her torture .
what ?
come on talk to me for just a minute .
what ?
you're just about done aren't you ?
where's your pacy ?
i know you see that .
you're one of those you notice electronics .
what are we going to do when you're eleven months ?
and much more active ?
maybe you're as active as you're going to be .
let's hope .
she's all over .
boy .
well .
so .
i guess i want first of all your impressions of what you thought most interested her out of these kinds of toys here .
probably the books .
okay .
and i think it was more to put them in her mouth .
okay .
she obviously excuse you .
didn't want .
want me to hold it for you ?
sure .
be better .
i think it will still pick up your voice .
okay .
she didn't want to read them she just wanted to eat them .
eat them was there anything in particular that she wanted to eat from these books ?
she likes .
she likes .
the corners of books .
i don't know why .
any particular book you think ?
no i don't think so .
okay .
does she have any books like these this at home ?
anything so do you think that she would like that she recognizes any of these as familiar to her ?
well we have the hard book type .
okay .
that she usually has on the floor with her .
and she chews on the corners .
yes .
yes .
so you found her the books books were the most interesting for her today .
and what did you think about the least interesting ?
i think probably the baby because she's dissuaded from playing with the baby at home .
got it .
they're kind of off limits .
yes they are .
even her own .
now you see it .
want to go for it ?
okay .
and what did shh what do you think about the stuffed animals ?
go for it .
how did she .
well look at you !
she kind of hadta find it on her own she had no interest in anything i gave her .
which is fine with me .
so did she find anything in particular that she liked out of the stuffed animals ?
definitely the bee .
do you think that's why she liked it ?
i think so .
okay .
the bee had different textures to it .
and how about the food and dishes types of toys ?
any interest in those ?
didn't really have not really .
okay .
she's pretty young but do you think they're any of those items that she would recognize the names of ?
some of this stuff .
like tacos and bottle and .
okay .
soup .
it's okay .
i mean you got it right there .
you said soup .
is she eating any finger foods ?
not yet .
okay .
she tries .
so when she comes back for her next visit soon we'll see if that changes .
that will be interesting .
probably .
and then do you have you said there's babies at home .
any of these other kinds of toys at home ?
she has books hard books .
stuffed animals we have a lot of but not really where they play .
does she have one that she's attached to at all ?
no .
okay .
we have this one at home or at my parent's house actually .
that bee ?
i don't think she's ever played with it she was too young when they got it .
so you don't think she likes the sticky hair but it's not because she recognizes it .
no .
okay .
unless she has an incredible memory .
okay .
is there anything else i needta .
ask ?
is there anything that you find that she really enjoys playing with or or exploring at home that we don't have here ?
things that make noise the keys kind of do but like a lot of shakers and .
some kids find the pitcher and put something in it and it makes a pretty loud noise .
so she would probably like something like that .
okay .
things that give instant gratification .
like the feeling of the bee .
so very sensory .
you like that .
shh we didn't really she didn't she didn't really play with anything that was very loud this time we'll see what happens .
next time if she's still interested in .
making noise .
nothing really kept her well except for this .
except for this bee so that was .
you said the books and then maybe the bee .
were the things okay .
definitely .
and .
i'm assuming she's putting things in her mouth at this stage ?
everything .
everything okay .
so that would be how she .
interact with a lot most things probably .
not don't don't let that .
here's your pacy .
we keep the pacifier in her mouth because she's extremely oral .
everything goes in .
and everything on the floor happens to be stuff she can't have .
that must prevent a lot of frustration to have that pacy in .
it does except she'll spit it out and find what she can't have .
do you do that ?
right when i can't be there to rescue it from her mouth .
pretty smart .
yes .
pretty smart at seven months old .
well .
i think that's all i needta ask you about what she likes to play with and how she's playing .
and then when she comes back at her ten month or so visit we'll probably ask you very similar kinds of questions and see how it changes for her .
but she seems like she might be about done .
i think so you're done ?
you ready for a nap ?
again ?
good work .
you can keep playing if you like .
what do you think she was most interested in today ?
i think anything she can chew .
like the soft food toys .
she liked and she does like stuffed animals .
okay .
so those two things i think would be .
is that similar to how she plays at home ?
because she's teething right now so anything that she can put in her mouth .
okay .
you agree ?
do you have the pretend food at home ?
i don't have the pretend fru food yet but obviously we'll be getting some .
do you play with the stuffed animals at home ?
she has a lot of stuffed animals and we have a bunch of poohbears which is why i thought she'd go for this but we have a ton of stuffed animals and she always goes for them .
which animals does she have at home ?
she's got a lot of those .
the brand is the lamaze toys .
they have all the and the you know and then she's got a few stuffed poohbears and just like classic teddy bears .
okay .
so .
do you think she recognized the names of any of the animal the stuffed animals she played with today ?
i don't think so .
no ?
no i don't think so .
at home the toy one toy we do have is a balloon and that's the one thing she will recognize if you say balloon she will turn in the house and look for it .
so .
that's the one she knows .
the peas .
peas .
that one i think she knows because we always used that was her first food .
and that's the one she .
you would eat all the time so we'd always we even bought a book about peas .
for her and we'd always just say peas please !
right ?
would you like some peas please ?
so that one i thought maybe she might .
any other foods that she played with that you thought .
that she would know the names or .
i don't think so you know ?
because we haven't really .
haven't really introduced her to she still like eats baby food and formula so .
but she has had icecream .
how about the books ?
did you .
did she .
she has the regular good night moon book at home and we read her all the doctor seuss books so .
that one but this one .
i don't think she recognizes the or them but we do read her .
to her .
does she like to play with books more than toys or toys more than books ?
well right now with the books it's more like especially the board books she puts it right in her mouth so it probably doesn't matter what as long as she can put it in her mouth .
but .
but she does enjoy the .
but she does at nighttime she sits my husband sits in a chair with her and they read .
and she'll just sit you know right before she goes to bed .
okay .
so .
that's nice .
that's their little thing .
right ?
do you think today here she showed more interest in the toys or the books ?
i think today was more into the toys .
okay .
and at home with .
you are so much happier here than the first part .
good way to end on this .
and so at home what does she gen you sa what does she usually play with like her favorite toys at home .
we have tons of teething stuff around the house .
and the any toy that like .
well she liked this bee by the way too because of his .
hair .
but anything that she can the toys we have all like and .
anything with lights .
and noises she has a huge doggie stuffed toy that has like you know every time you press something it says this is his foot and sings a song .
so she likes anything with lights and noise .
that's cute .
right ?
and you i know i saw that you forgot about him ?
you like mister bee .
does she have any dolls at home ?
she has .
she has but they're like soft dolls .
nothing like this but .
just like the you know they'll be like this but a doll looking .
and do you call it a doll ?
i do .
i say it's her babydoll .
does she just play with it like the way she plays with other stuffed animals ?
exactly the same .
she is liking that .
i know .
before i pulled it away and she had like one piece that she was just holding in her mouth .
and the spoon ?
the balloon and her name are like the two things that we just kind of recognized ourselves .
that she knew like .
like if you said the balloon or say her name she would turn .
in the direction of the you know us or the balloon in the house .
so those are the only two things that i know of .
right now .
would you like a spoon ?
is the what do you think think she least sorry liked the least ?
i don't know .
i don't know .
i mean she doesn't you know she's not attentive to listen to a book .
long enough but i mean i don't .
that's too bad we're still doing that .
right ?
i don't know i think she liked it all .
she was very happy here .
really ?
that's good .
there wasn't anything that you tried to introduce that she was like .
this isn't happening for me right now .
no i don't think so .
you know some she was more like she definitely had a preference for like this stuffed animal versus this stuffed animal .
okay .
you know but i think it's because of his hair .
she likes it see ?
well she picked up the .
she picked up the other one the .
she did pick up the frog she actually moved to get the frog .
so he was back here and she did move to get him .
why do you think that is ?
i don't know if the color ?
maybe ?
i don't know .
she went right over the other one .
she .
i'll just use you to .
you're just going to help me get to my frog .
right ?
what is that ?
you got a little monster in you ?
right ?
you can go ahead and just keep playing .
okay .
and then i have some questions i wanted to ask .
okay .
okay .
sure okay absolutely .
so what did you think interested her the most out of the toys that we have here ?
this bumblebee for sure .
and the spoon .
why do you think she likes those likes that in particular .
i think the colors and she's never .
this is pretty stringy .
i think the material .
it's different .
and she doesn't have anything like that at all .
okay .
and it probably the texture probably feels different in her mouth .
and then she so she really likes that ?
what else does she like ?
the spoon this purple spoon .
okay .
we're going to have to get some spoons out for you we don't have any spoons .
is that her favorite one ?
this one .
this purple one and and then the keys .
she likes the keys .
but i think this one .
this one for sure .
you got on your face .
okay .
good .
and so you said the texture with that do you think the other things as well ?
is that why she likes the spoons and keys and stuff the texture ?
no i think these are hard .
and i think it probably feels good on her .
her teeth .
and it fits in her mouth pretty good .
and its easy for her to to wield it you know .
she has a lot to see .
okay good and how about what do you think interested her the least ?
the book .
the books i think and maybe the stuffed ani the other stuffed animals .
most of hers have you know little squeaky things so it was kinda a little bit hard to get her attention .
but that's all right .
were you showing her some of those ?
this one and the the pink poodle and .
the goose .
and the zebra .
she didn't i'm surprised she didn't pick up on this because usually the white and black grabs her attention .
but .
maybe that one .
this was hard to compete with .
that one was gone she would've liked that one better over there .
okay so you think stuffed animals and the books ?
i mean i didn't explore the doll with her and she doesn't really have any .
she was really kind of focused over this area .
so do you have for instance toys like the dishes and food at home ?
no we don't have dishes and food .
she has lots of stuffed animals .
she has lots of books .
and no baby dolls ?
no baby doll no .
and do you think out of any of the items here there are any that she would recognize the names of ?
or would she have heard before .
well i was looking for a giraffe because i was wondering if she re she has a a .
chew toy that's a giraffe .
just to see if she would recognize it .
its kinda shaped the same .
and i was wondering if she might pick up on the book .
the term book .
but she didn't really seem to pay any attention to it so .
we'll see next time .
she may be less interested in that next time .
maybe i it interests me and i you know this is the one that i picked up first because it was different than anything she's seen .
so i can try something different next time and see if she .
see what she does .
there's a lot of change that can happen between now and then .
and i know she wasn't really interested in the books today but does she have books at home ?
are there ones that she likes better ?
she likes the well i was kinda well she's sitting on it the one that has the feely .
but she's got some other ones that just like there's a farm animal book .
that she likes .
and then there's a numbers book that just has big big pictures in it but i don't think you know i think she .
they're bigger too and so that she can they lay out in front of her and she can just kinda crawl on it and stuff .
does she like sorry .
those seem to capture .
she tries .
she tries .
i don't know she tends to get a little frustrated and then move on to the next thing .
because we we actually have a bunch toys that are kinds scattered out and so i don't not sure if that's a good thing or not .
because its easy distraction and then she doesn't you know tend to work on the the one item .
right .
okay .
and actually she likes we have blocks .
i don't see any blocks here .
that was going to be another question is are there toys that we don't have here ?
she has some foam blocks and some wooden blocks .
and then the stacking rings thing .
and and in the waiting room you had the little the maize thing .
she has one of those too and she actually does i don't know if that she's realized she can move them along the wire but she does like to grab onto it and and spin them .
okay so she likes blocks and the maize thing .
and .
what else did you say there was one more thing ?
the stacking ring thing .
and she actually she likes anything that makes noise .
okay .
so she's got a little key ring that that makes noise and there's a couple other little toys like that if you press the right and what she really likes is her exersaucer .
okay .
with all the other you know the spinning things with the .
the confetti type stuff in it and the mirrors and she has a mirror she really likes .
okay okay that's interesting to know .
it it's a it's a fish shaped like a fish so when you hit it makes you know like kinda of undersea bubble noises and then its got the mirror on it .
she's liked that from very early on .
and she still does ?
she still does .
careful !
did you put that a little too far back ?
i seriously doubt it .
okay .
she had a ice cream cone .
recognize ice cream ?
hard to tell right now .
okay .
and i think i asked you everything i have here .
so the things she likes the best do you is there a reason you think they might be good for her personality like the kind of infant she is or not necessarily ?
careful sweetheart !
here you mean ?
because of her personality ?
i .
i it's hard to say .
i mean i think she picked up on this because it was different and that so that's you know she's generally pretty curious and wants to you know explore different things .
it's hard to know if that's personality or .
and at home what do you think ?
at home .
i think well i mean if the exersaucer counts as a toy i mean i think she likes that because she can actually jump up and down and she's not like .
she falls over at home sometimes and i think she that limits a little bit how far she's willing to go at times especially if she's tired .
i don't know that's a tough question .
that's okay .
she likes the little toys and i think mostly because she can easily grab them and put them in her mouth .
right .
and its hard here for her to be as active as she might at home so with the set up but just curious sometimes if there's differences based on activity level or .
that's fine we're probably going to ask you the same questions next time .
okay .
alright .
i'll have to i didn't think personality i was thinking that she was just curious and so she you know she .
she does move pretty good at home .
so .
okay we'll see how she changes .
okay .
between now and then she may play differently .
she may like different things so we'll have the same toys and we'll see how it goes .
okay okay good .
good good .
yup .
okay what do you think ava enjoyed the most ?
playing today .
she liked the baby .
she doesn't have a babydoll at home .
she doesn't ?
she doesn't .
so .
that was new for her .
she really likes books .
she has a lot of books at home she loves to just turn the pages .
see she's going after the baby again .
and then she likes she liked this thing .
like the fur .
she plays with she has a couple things at home that have a little fur .
she's like she likes the baby .
and i guess the things that made noise like the keys and this thing .
how would with regards to the baby what do you think that she liked about the baby ?
she does that when she's trying to show off and get your attention she'll go sideways i don't know why .
i think because it's the same size at her .
because she has a couple stuffed animals and she's more interested in the ones that are the bigger ones that are about her size .
i think the face .
like the eyes i think she's in tune with .
and i don't know maybe this one .
because it looks like her and i think because it makes noise .
it's head makes noise .
it's like a rattle but .
maybe that's disgusting she likes to kiss it .
it's okay we we clean the toys it's fine .
okay .
what do you think what were the kind of things that you were doing to kind of keep her engaged with the baby ?
just like made it talk to her .
i sat it on my lap because i wasn't sure if she would like get jealous or not but .
she didn't seem to care she came over and gave it a kiss so .
that's nice .
i think maybe we should get her a babydoll .
what do you think about the the books ?
do you have similar books at home ?
the books that are her favorite at home are the one that have the touchy feely things in them .
she likes those the best .
because she likes to run her hand down the page and try to figure out like where it is .
and plus i think it makes them easier to turn .
because they're kinda halfway open so she can turn the pages really easy .
so i think those are her favorite .
i guess maybe the colors .
but she wasn't you know she liked this one but not really the other ones so .
what kind of textures do you think she likes the most .
she likes the fur .
because she i guess that's her fine motor skills working on that .
she likes the fur i think .
and then this one doesn't have any .
but at home we have ones that have like like bumps .
or like like velcro you know like the scratchy part of the velcro she loves those .
interesting .
i don't know why i guess because it's real easy for her to feel .
so she likes those .
and .
i think you played were you playing peek a boo or was that .
no .
i don't think so .
she likes to play peek a boo and actually she she'll play peek a boo with herself .
so she'll take a cover up over her head and then pull it off .
and she'll do it as long as you're if you keep saying where's ava where's ava ?
there she is !
then she'll do it .
so she plays she likes peek a boo a lot .
that's cute .
one of her favorite games .
so .
and then this book happened to be about animals .
do you think she you've been over certain names of animals with her or .
well we have a cat and she knows the word for cat like if i .
normally if i say it .
she'll start like looking around and trying to find the cat .
so .
ava cat ?
cat ?
no she's not here i'm sorry .
so .
but so she really likes the cat .
that's the one that she cat and parrot too .
we have a stuffed parrot and she likes that .
that's .
it's a .
so she liked the this puppet .
and her parrot at home is a puppet .
and so she likes that .
i don't know know because it reacts or something i don't know .
and it tickles !
what were there any other animals stuffed animals that you played with ?
this one she played with this guy she liked this .
stuff .
she likes that part .
she can pull it and .
it's kinda like sticky .
and a couple of her animals have like little fur like stuff they're not sticky like this but .
little strings for their tails .
and she'll sit there and just like pull on them for you know keep her entertained for about five minutes which .
in her day that's a long time so .
do you think she'd recognize the name for bee ?
no .
no .
no she only knows .
i think like three words .
maybe four she knows up .
and she knows cat .
and i think mama and kissy .
i noticed you had she was running over to the camera and so you were giving her you know you said some no and she stopped .
she does know no .
and then during the play you were saying good job and was wondering if you felt like because i noticed she understood the no and i was just wondering .
she does i think she understands praise for sure .
because that's how we got her to like if we say give mommy kissy she'll give you a kiss and then we made like such a big deal out of it .
and so now she does it for the praise i think .
right now we're working on highfive and .
so she'll do that .
but i think she does know when you're like good job good job and she gets excited so .
and what about any of the play food ?
did she .
she .
doesn't really well she was interested in the spaghetti for some real she doesn't eat any finger foods at all she only has purees so .
she doesn't know what any of it is .
and she doesn't drink out of a juice cup either so the juice i think was interesting because it moved but .
she doesn't know what is .
and then she played with the pizza but .
i don't think she's ever seen pizza before .
i think it was just the colors .
the contrast on there .
that makes sense .
so and plus it's kind of squishy .
so there's not really anything that she that you may have used the name of at home or something that she'd be familiar with or even .
no .
she nope .
nope not even .
n i mean she doesn't even drink a bottle so .
so she doesn't really .
not yet .
what do you think she was least interested in ?
today .
probably the food .
and then i mean she didn't really pay attention to this that much .
i don't expect her to know what a clock is .
and i mean then particular stuffed animals i guess .
like these aren't necessarily as brightly colored so .
she didn't really go for those and like .
she didn't look at any of these books she has this book but she doesn't look at it .
she didn't really play with any of this stuff .
and now she's playing with the pizza again .
and the spaghetti .
but you did so do you have stuffed animals at home ?
we have some .
we have some stuffed animals .
and she plays with those .
she like i said she plays with a lot of books .
she spends the majority of her time on the floor .
like .
she doesn't go in her bouncer she doesn't go in a swing .
she doesn't i don't carry her in a sling .
she we have an exersaucer .
she hates it .
doesn't want to be in it .
so .
she spends most of her time crawling around or .
she can pull up on things and so she just likes to .
you know crawl and over to like couch and pull up on the couch and sometimes i'll like spread toys out on the couch and she plays with them .
and then she has a lot of little like i don't know like fisher price like little activity things that she'll play with .
and those will keep her entertained but .
she's not really into all the automated kind of like swings and stuff so .
she spends most of her time just kind of hanging out on the floor crawling around and chasing the cat and and stuff so .
sounds like she just likes to be free .
she does .
she doesn't like to be confined .
she does like to go in her stroller that's the one thing .
she likes to go on walks .
she likes to be outside .
so we try to spend at least an hour or two outside .
just like walking around and looking at stuff so .
she doesn't like to be if we're inside all day .
or we don't go anywhere that day she gets really like ornery .
like she wants to go somewhere just .
doesn't matter where like target the mall she doesn't care just doesn't want to be home all the time so .
right .
well that's nice .
that's nice you're social !
well i guess i think i just had one question about the stuffed animals because it seems like she tends to play with toys .
and that seemed to be something she liked here today .
and that's if because you had gone i feel like you played with a lot of stuffed animals .
does she have any did you find any in particular that she liked or did you feel that it was better to kind of go through them all ?
well we didn't go through them all .
i mean we looked at this one because it has sparkles she likes things that are sparkly .
she likes that guy .
and then she liked this .
fur .
it's not my puppy .
and on the first page is this book .
actually we have the book with us and it looks just like this dog so .
she played with that .
and it .
looks just like it .
he came .
right outta your book !
she may recognize that .
but she likes stuffed animals and like i said we have a our parrot is a puppet and she really likes that so we played with this .
she has a really short attention span so .
i mean i'm sure all babies do but she doesn't like concentrate on something for very long .
so that's why we went through a lot of them .
a lot of toys keeping her happy .
do you feel like she played similarly here as she does at home ?
i think she wasn't frustrated here because sometimes at home i think she gets bored or frustrated with like the same toys so .
these were newer so i think they held enter her attention span longer .
which is good .
well good !
so .
well i'm glad that she enjoyed herself .
because we have a couple more visits just like this okay ?
yup .
and we don't have carpet at home so she was playing with the carpet a little bit too so .
we just have hardwood floors so i think she she was playing with the colors she was doing that in the waiting room too .
really ?
she was like trying to pick at them .
that's funny !
alright well i'm just going to stop all of the recording and equipment now .
okay .
go ahead .
so what do you think that she enjoyed the most ?
she really liked this pully stretchy hair on this guy .
she loved that .
i think just because she's really into right now just like feeling and pulling and really exploring stuff like that .
she likes books .
she lik she loves pooh bear so she liked that .
she likes the animals a lot .
do you have pooh at home ?
so it's her she got it for christmas so .
and it's it looks it's a little bit bigger than this .
so it looks pretty identical to that .
i was surprised she didn't like the puppet more because she usually likes puppets but she wasn't really interested in that .
what el she loved playing she loved the baby .
she was kissing it and loving it and .
which surprised me because she has babies at home .
but it must be the size of this one .
she doesn't have one this big or this life like looking .
she slobbered al still wet with slobber .
so she loved that so that was kinda neat to see .
sorry .
here honey .
alright alright .
okay .
alright there you go .
there you go .
that's all it takes .
okay .
alright .
okay so you said she was she likes to play with she does play with babydolls at home .
she has them .
but like i said one's a cabbage patch a small cabbage like mini cabbage patch .
it's about this big .
and the other is just like a it's a a doll with like yarn hair and like a stitched on face and stuff so it doesn't look nearly as life like as that one .
so she really liked that one .
and so so she played with it like kissing it .
she was kissing it and just .
i mean i played peekaboo with her at first and she liked that and then when she saw it she just kissed it all over .
and she loves these little keys .
she's teething right now so anything little shh keys like this anything she chews up but .
and she lik she liked these t she she liked mostly everything .
was there something that you gave her that she didn't like ?
this this aggravated her .
because she couldn't she tried to drink from it .
and she couldn't .
so this is upset her .
so .
does she drink from a bottle ?
only a little bit at night some formula .
she'll get a little bit of formula at night .
so she's used to the bottle .
okay .
so she knows what's in the bottle .
so i thought this was funny that she this made her mad .
but otherwise she well i showed her something she just was not interested in at all .
it was one of the stuffed animals .
the zebra she didn't care about at all .
this the seal she really didn't either .
forgot about the spaghetti .
she loved the spaghetti .
did she ?
yes .
she loved that so .
is it is that a name that's familiar to her ?
i mean we have spaghetti a lot .
but so .
i thought that was interesting .
but it's also i think the maybe the color or the feeling the texture of it .
may have reall she really liked that but .
was there anything here that you think that she's like never heard of or never seen before ?
let me think .
like the i don't think she's ever seen a seal like this before for sure .
we don't have a toy otter .
although i've talked about otters to my so not to her though so she hasn't really seen otters much .
and the meat .
like she hasn't seen like she hasn't seen toy like food before we don't have any toy food yet .
okay .
so she hasn't seen any of that but she liked it .
so .
okay .
and then did you does at home does she prefer toys or books ?
she prefers toys .
she just eats books basically right now .
so .
and did you find that she was a did you read books in here ?
like we have this one at home and this on .
we read books a lot at home .
because of ga i mean gabe loves books .
and so she's always reading them with us .
but i have to keep her like off of them because she'll chew them up .
because that's all she just wants to like rip at them and chew them right now .
so she'll look at them for a little bit but she really likes this one .
they both love mister brown can .
the noises and they like put me in the zoo too .
so .
and this one she i just noticed today actually she would this one she'd actually paid more attention to it than she normally would .
so with the animals .
which was good .
do you have that one at home ?
we don't have this one .
okay .
no .
but just we have lots of animal books and stuff but this one she she really paid attention longer than normal for this for like that type of book .
so .
was it do you think because of the ducks or the name of the ducks or the feel ?
she the feel she started f actually feeling it .
because i i've been asking her like when we read the books okay feel here and stuff and she wouldn't .
she just would like try to grab it and eat it .
so i think she's actually maybe starting to understand what she's supposed to do .
not just eat it .
it's a process .
so .
it is .
so .
were there any like do you have pretend food at home ?
no we don't have any yet .
which is like i just haven't ever haven't bought it yet .
but she really liked it so .
my gosh she has she pulled this over .
it's okay for us i just if she chews on it .
she she really seemed to like it .
she was chewing on i do not know this i think it's a piece of meat i don't even kno .
and like i said the spaghetti .
so we don't have any of that at home .
she liked the cookie too .
so .
okay .
does she eat any of those foods or ?
no not yet .
no she hasn't even i mean she hasn't had like a full sized anything like this .
she's had like a bit of like i break off crackers and give it to her but she hasn't had anything like this .
but her brother has cook we like we made cookies today .
okay .
like she knows what cookies are .
she does ?
she just can't eat them .
i mean we have cookies in the house and stuff so .
that's i think she she saw that .
well it's probably it's probably the colors too .
she wanted to chew on that maybe .
but she liked that .
and she liked the i don't know where it went .
this .
the mystery meat .
so .
this though the hair .
like i said this she really liked .
we definitely don't have anything like this at home .
does she the word or does she use the word .
do you use the word bee ?
bee yes .
especially right now we have bees all over the yard so we've been watching the bees and avoiding the bees and everything so .
but i don't know i mean we don't have a stuffed bee at home at all but .
okay .
so .
i thought i had one more .
i had .
so if you hadta pick a favorite toy today what do you think it would be ?
i think it's a toss up she loved this and but i think this really .
no she loved the baby too .
i would say the baby just because she loved ripping at this but just the way she interacted with the baby .
she the way she was kissing it and really just like and loving it .
that i think was her favorite thing .
so .
like she it wasn't just like something to teethe on or something she really liked it .
you know .
so .
and did you find that this is how she plays at home ?
she just goes from one thing to the next like grabbing at everything tasting everything and .
that's what she does .
trying to chew on it .
but like she just moves from one thing to the next and we just like we do the very similar not as many toys but we set out different ones and i just pull out different things for her .
to like change it up and then .
and it's usually she does go after her brother's toys so she plays with trucks a lot .
so so .
but but that's basically this is basically what she does without as much like concentration .
okay .
of things .
but .
and now she's she's just started to crawl so she can move herself around to things that she wants .
so she has more options now too .
but .
that's good you can see what she's more interested in .
she really likes that b i have to get her her own little baby .
it's cute .
you have a baby .
yes you do !
a baby of your own .
she's like i've been my brother's baby .
haven't you ?
she's funny .
you're funny !
she really likes that .
that's really neat .
look what you have !
i see you .
we see what you have .
she's just showing off for you .
is it okay if i ask you some questions now ?
sure .
what do you think he liked to play with the most what was his favorite ?
this little cookie .
how did he play with it ?
i think it's like it's kind of novel as far as a toy that he can fit in his hand really easily .
so he was .
i don't know .
feeling it banging it .
sticking it in his mouth .
and he set it down and he'd play something else and he'd come right back to it .
so .
was there anything else do you think he knows is familiar with either the like the name of it or the shape or the color what do you think was most attractive ?
it might be that it's colorful or .
i'm trying to think i can't even think of a single toy that we have that looks like this .
at our house .
so it might be the fact that it's novel .
but like i tried to show him the peas which are about the same size i thought they'd be equally interesting and they're not .
they're just not so i think it's a combination of color and .
maybe size ?
once he got it in his hand like this .
just like .
what was that ?
you just love it .
i'm kind of baffled .
i think too i don't know it might be recognizeably recognizeable as food .
something that looks like food .
was he putting it in his mouth ?
yup .
and he's just starting to get to finger foods now like where he wants to put his own food in his mouth .
even though he's not very successful .
he's trying .
he's trying .
were there any other toys that he liked playing with ?
he liked he likes books in general he liked this one better than he liked he wanted to read this one .
he was navigating his own way through this one .
turning the pages and .
feeling all the things and then you turn the page and feel the things so .
he really liked that one .
he liked the keys .
they make a shaky noise ?
and he played with this one for a significant amount of time .
and the spoon .
that's pretty typical we have a lot of like long handle spoons and stuff that i let him play with he really likes those in general .
i tried a couple stuffed animals and he was not interested .
do you have keys for him to play with at home or .
nothing quite that small or easily to manage i think his stuff is a little more bulky to manage so i think .
this is a little attractive .
because it's a little bit easier to wield .
you think the noise was attractive ?
i think so .
but he seemed as interested just to look at them as to shake them i don't know he shook them more than he shook other things though .
i think probably the noise was important .
did he did did you try to play with the babydoll or did you try to introduce that ?
i didn't introduce the babydoll we've looked at babydolls at our house before and he hasn't been that interested .
okay .
not yet .
what do you think was the least favorite thing ?
not yet .
in here .
well .
i don't know like i said i tried to use the stuffed animals and he's just not interested .
i don't know if it's .
i don't know .
so we try to use them at home too and it's just not interesting too .
stuffed animals are just not interesting .
were the animal names in on the farm book do you think that any of them were familiar to him ?
i think so i think the .
well i'm not sure if the animal names he knows the s well i think he recognizes the sounds a little more like if i .
or if i like a sheep .
or like the horse whinny he really loves the horse whinny it makes him giggle .
every time .
so i think maybe he recognizes some of th i think he recognizes some of the animal sounds .
particularly the cow the sheep and the horse .
the sound effects that you bring with it ?
okay .
and then i noticed you call what are do you always call him scott or scottie what are some .
it's usually scott or scottie his dad sometimes calls him pants .
i have no idea why .
scott or scottie though most of the time .
his brother usually calls him scottie .
are you using any baby signs ?
just a little bit like more and book are pretty much the extent of baby signs at this point .
okay .
how is it different than playing at home ?
do you .
despite i think he has a sibling so also playing together ?
sometimes .
his brother's at the age where he appreciates social interaction positive social interaction so .
when he feels like his brother's entertained by him he's really happy about that so he does try to entertain scott a lot .
and sing songs then plays with his toes and things like that .
and he occasionally tries to read him books like he has some memorized that he'll try to read to him .
which is really fun .
and he loves it he just eats it up .
he adores his brother of course .
as all younger siblings do right ?
and usually he wants whatever his older brother has and that's off limits .
it's always you know the older brother's like no i'm not going to share with you .
so .
do you i think you played also with the clock do you think as far as a time do you have a clock at home ?
i have a big one on the wall .
but the numbers are different .
like ours we have like roman numeral numbers or whatever so .
i'm not sure if he's familiar with it at all .
pretty high up on the wall too like i was thinking about it i don't i just don't even know if it's in his .
range of vision most of the time he's like on the floor or on the couch and that's still like another three or four feet above him so .
so do you do like counting with him ?
we do by default because we're working on it with his brother .
a lot .
so he does hear those .
he hears those words those numbers a lot .
hi .
what can i do for you you're so busy playing .
what can i do for you ?
what can i do for you ?
do you ever play like pattycake or any other types of like touchy kind of games like sensor .
yes .
we do pattycake we do .
called one called ball for baby .
and usually what i do is i do like the little signs while i'm singing it and then i hold his hands and let him do them and he thinks that's very funny .
and we have a mirror .
like i pulled a mirror out of our bedroom .
and i will sit with him on my lap and we'll look in and i'll let him do the hand signs and he enjoys that too like he thinks it's very cool to watch the baby do it .
that's really cute .
and then .
like stuff tick like tickling games and things like that .
he loves it .
he loves to be tickled ?
psst !
psst !
psst psst !
he already knows what's coming .
yep .
do you think he knows any of these foods i know we kind of strayed away from there but any of them being familiar or looking familiar or .
that's a good question sorry i'll try not to cough in the microphone .
i don't know actually .
like he is as yet he's not really started finger foods yet .
most of his stuff is puree .
and so what he sees or i think like the only thing like he probably recognizes is the banana .
because that's the only thing he gets more up close .
trying to think .
like he might recognize bread because we do a lot of sandwiches at lunch time with his brother but .
i don't know .
he's a little bit lower i'm like trying to think he's like a little bit his high chair's a little bit lower than .
the table so his eye level's like right at the table level like maybe two inches above it would be hard for him to really see the food so i don't think so .
okay .
it's you know .
he's young .
sometimes when there's another sibling they hear a lot of you know like pizza or whatever the sibling is .
into .
exactly .
and then are you doing like body parts with him or .
sometimes we do mostly we're doing the ones that he's excited about so we're working right now with toes and feet and fingers and hands .
and that's about it .
i think we do eyes .
we've been doing eyes too .
so do you just a final question is there anything that you think was like very different in how he played with you today ?
than usual .
no i think this is pretty typical .
he self-motivates a lot of his play .
he likes for me to play with him but especially if a toy is new he'll play by himself for a long time like without .
it is really nice .
both of my boys are like that .
he is really practicing .
talking .
he's been doing this since he was born like seriously he's like the biggest chatterbox i've ever since .
really ?
in fact one of our friends likes like trying to adopt right now and they're like we just we just decided we just want your baby .
because he's the husband really likes the incredibles and you've seen like the little video of like jack jack like burst into flames or whatever and he's just like just like jabbering all the time .
this is what he does .
and so our friends like love that .
bless you .
you okay ?
you okay ?
got it under control ?
say hi sabrina .
hi !
okay so that concludes the .
i'm just going to ask you some questions .
i don't have to write it down because we're recording .
sure .
which toys do you think he liked the best ?
the bee .
and the peas .
and the clock .
which toys do you think he liked the least ?
the pretend most of the pretend food .
i mean he liked the peas .
because of the texture .
and it was within reach .
but we haven't done much or he hasn't done much i don't think with pretend stuff .
does he have any toys like this at home ?
we do we have i mean we have good night moon .
we have another karen katz book .
another bright baby book .
some doctor seuss .
we've done a little bit with stuffed animals .
well he has a few stuffed animals that are like his favorite .
but we don't do we're just getting into the stuffed animal thing .
and he does not have pretend food .
at home i don't think .
do you think there's any items that you think your child recognizes the name of ?
i do think so .
he was excited to see the chicken .
and w he has a picture of a chicken .
in his room .
right next to his changing table .
that he can grab .
and we always say ".
you're fighting with the chicken .
so i think .
he definitely recognized .
i think he recognized the name of that .
and he's had keys before .
and the duck .
and like the the pictures in the bright baby we we go through the the names of those .
and i'm sure .
if we had played more with the pretend bottles he would've recognized .
the word .
but .
or .
i guess we just call it milk we don't call it a bottle .
so i don't know .
are there any toys you think he doesn't recognize that he's never seen before maybe ?
well he goes to daycare .
like a home daycare with a .
wide age range .
age range of kids .
so i don't know if they it doesn't seem to me that they have a lot of dolls there .
so like the baby doll i don't think he's familiar with .
i don't you know so i don't know about the food .
i'm sure he's .
some of it looks very familiar .
and like i know he's he's seen it before .
i'm trying to think what else .
maybe you know donkey .
kangaroo fox .
they're kind of .
i don't know what this one is .
i guess it's a squirrel .
they're kind of not .
i'm sorry ?
groundhog ?
groundhog yes !
so those are kinda like not your regular animals .
but some of the more regular ones like chicken or frog .
he's he's definitely seen before .
you got it kiddo .
good job !
that's right .
i know it's hard it runs away from you .
alright !
there you go kiddo .
do you think he prefers playing with toys or books ?
that's a good question because he likes books .
but i think he likes the toys because they're more .
independent .
he has started just the past week or so he's started grabbing the books and pretending to read them himself .
but probably toys better .
you said you have some of these books at home .
right .
so i thought he would be like .
excited to see familiar .
stuff .
and that's where .
i like to start .
because .
it gives me some confidence .
like i know exactly how to play with you with a book !
but .
so he likes the books but .
it's different .
so he probably likes toys better .
so you're bypassing the book completely .
haha .
he likes those keys .
they're fun .
okay that's it .
okay .
so i just have a few questions for you .
okay .
okay let's see .
which of the toys did he seem the most interested in ?
why did you why did you think that was ?
he likes noisy .
noisy toys .
so this .
okay .
if you hadta pick a toy that you would say was good for his personality .
what would you say ?
good for his personality .
just about anything that makes noise .
at this age i would say .
okay .
which toys did he seem the least interested in ?
he's not interested in in stuffed animals so far i think .
the puppet was okay but this stuff .
i mean he kinda touched everything else but .
i'd say the stuffed animal .
okay .
would you say he prefers book over toys or book or toys over books ?
do you read at home ?
i do and he's just getting into books so i'd say toys over books right now .
okay .
do you have any of these toys at home ?
i have something like this but .
and the books but .
not the food and stuff like that .
okay .
and do you think he recognizes names of any of these items ?
no .
i don't think so .
okay .
i thought he might the bottle but he didn't seem to so .
not when i say it .
do you ever play with pretend food at home ?
no .
okay .
let's see what else we have .
what about animals ?
do you think he ?
see some kids are really into animals really early on and they recognize the names .
does he seem ?
no i don't i don't think so .
okay i think that's all we have .
okay .
so we can go and switch .
and get them .
well i have a few questions to ask you if you don't mind .
and she can just sit on your lap .
you like that better sitting on mom's lap ?
it's funny the books .
she can hang onto her keys if she wants .
she can let go of them .
she likes those !
it was so interesting that she really didn't she really didn't like those books .
i i wonder what .
it's interesting because we really only read books at night .
so she associates the .
it may be .
the books at night .
it may be .
it wouldn't be the first time .
we usually don't read that often during the day just at night .
haha and she you know ?
so what so it seemed like it was pretty obvious she liked .
the things she could rattle .
the keys and and .
i was just going to ask you why do you think she liked those ?
was it something about .
i mean we have a pair that are that are not like those but probably kind of similar .
like a different .
i don't know if she recognizes like the ones she has at home .
she has much like bigger ones but .
that are also the keys ?
they're kind of like keys .
they have i mean they're they're keys .
but they're different brand of them .
so i don't know if she recognizes as a toy that she's used to ?
she like that one at home too ?
yes .
she likes to shake them .
what else does she did you think that she liked ?
the measuring cups she seemed to really enjoy .
probably because they're the same concept as .
hanging on a .
circular .
shaking them .
making noises .
they made some noises didn't they ?
you like all the noises .
well which what do you think in general are toys that are good for her personality ?
she does seem to like at home .
like putting balls in something .
she's starting to do things like that .
but that make noises like noise .
and she knows they come out the bottom .
kind of looking to see what happens and .
starting to figure some things .
like the cause and effect kinds of things ?
starting to figure out cause and effect a little bit more than .
do you do that ?
well you like those k .
are you going to look at those keys ?
what do you think interested her the least of what we have here ?
well the book seemed to make her upset for some reason .
not really sure why .
i wonder if it does have to do with .
i don't know .
she didn't seem to want to .
want to do that .
and i don't know if it's because it's hard to she can't really suck on books quite as easily not shake them .
they're just not quite as fun .
for her to hold and play with .
the animals she she kind of lost interest in them .
we actually don't have a whole lot of stuffed animals at home .
okay .
but we have a couple different things .
but not more kind of toys that she can hold onto .
i think there have been a few other kids .
toys that we can clean easily we have at .
she just .
she didn't really care for those .
at least not at this visit .
no not really .
okay .
she kind of stared at the doll for a while .
okay .
she likes that .
she does stare at like faces a lot .
is that what she was doing ?
i couldn't tell .
she was just pretty much looking at the baby's face .
and that was about it but .
i've noticed other children she'll just stare and laugh at smaller kids .
much more than at adults .
interesting .
so when you're out and about or whatever and you see .
she goes to daycare .
and there's eight infants in her class .
okay .
we will have to .
well i know she didn't like the books today .
but does she have any at home that she likes in particular ?
that one we do read a lot .
and then we have one called the bellybutton book that she seems to really .
those are her favorites ?
those seem to be her favorites .
the fluffy chicken .
she likes to feel the different textures .
fluffy chicken !
is that what you like ?
and that one has textures in it like ?
and then she like feels the different .
fur on it .
but i think the keys are about her favorite .
i was g you might have already mentioned that about the keys being something that she may recognize from home .
and anything else that we have here that you feel like she might recognize from that you have at home ?
or that she might recognize from daycare ?
not re i mean we don't really have any of the kitchen stuff yet and all the .
we don't really have any of that yet at home .
there's a lot of that .
i mean just little animals you know we have some of those at home .
just like little beaniebabies things .
i would say this is probably the most .
like our toy at home .
what were you saying sabrina ?
would she recognize some of the foods like in real life ?
i don't i don't know if she would recognize them or not .
or if she .
she seemed to like the can .
like the soup can .
and i i d i mean .
what do you think she liked about th .
she did sort of engage with that a little bit .
one in the grocery store .
did she play with those when she was in here ?
i mean i always kind of try to stack them up for her .
she's kind of pushing them around .
although i think at home she likes balls .
like pushing balls around on the floor .
they kind of do that .
kind of .
i saw her playing with like the slices .
the p the pizza slices .
i don't i don't .
you liked that for a while .
and maybe because it was small it could fit in her hand .
she could easily grasp it put it in her mouth .
grasp it .
that could be .
she could really hold onto it .
like she's holding onto the .
haha .
do you think she in general prefers toys or books ?
i feel like toys .
more toys .
more toys than books .
okay and .
does she ?
like we were actually went on vacation a couple weeks ago .
and her stroller it's kind of give her a book .
right megan ?
we have like a little baby laptop kind of thing at home .
and she likes to just shut it .
and then she'll try to open .
and then shut it again .
do you do any games with her like back and forth games or like rhymes ?
i mean like that kind of stuff .
the peekaboo she's starting to really get the hang of it now .
okay .
if we duck .
we'll play it .
and that's fun .
she's generally just a very happy baby .
she certainly seemed like it .
you think she's pretty active ?
you're a well adjusted little girl ?
you've seen a lot of other babies .
well i think that's all we have .
did you have any questions before we wrap it up ?
not really .
if you just leave your microphone on and i can ask you some questions .
okay .
that way i won't have to write anything down .
perfect .
and you'll just a second .
continue to eat his plate .
hopefully he'll just play and be happy while we talk for a minute .
so which of the toys or kinds of toys did you think interested him the most ?
anything he can stuff in his mouth right now .
and so what were those things ?
did he i wasn't wasn't watching him .
he had this in .
this in .
the mystery meat .
the keys .
he tries to eat books a lot at home he didn't try that as much here .
did you read a book this time or looked at a book ?
we looked at a book .
we did goodnight moon which we read at home constantly .
there's the front .
although this is the counting book so .
it's different then .
i actually haven't seen that one .
i haven't either that's why i wanted to read it .
i was like this is for me .
okay .
so it was the one we usually have but we also have the mr brown book but we don't read that as much at home .
but he's not as interested in books as noah was at this age .
cause she would turn the pages like she knew exactly what was coming next like she had certain books .
he has a couple of books at home that he really likes consistently and the other ones he gets real wiggly in .
he's ready to go .
i mean .
he likes over things .
so when anna and i are reading he's always there but not necessarily attending to the book .
okay so .
so .
you would say that at this age he likes toys better than books ?
yes .
okay .
he does .
okay and you said he likes the things he puts in his mouth .
are there certain are there any of the toys that that you think are good for his personality ?
like you said your daughter was more into books and he's not is is .
there anything here or even at home that you think .
he has a couple of truck things that he thinks are really cool .
like he'll roll all over the house and he does consecutive rolls to get to certain trucks .
is that how he gets there ?
he's and he's starting to do that he pivots nicely on his belly .
so he'll pivot and roll and he's starting to do a sorta backwards combat crawl which is usually you know emerges backward before .
it goes anywhere forward .
so we keep finding him jammed under furniture .
but there are a couple of trucks that he tries very hard to get .
okay .
which of the things here did you think interested him the least ?
he's not real big into stuffed animals although he thought the frog was pretty funny .
so that's what he was giggling about was the frog for some reason .
but he's usually not real big on stuffed animals .
do you think he recognizes like the the fact that it is a frog ?
do you do frog stories or frog ribbits things ?
no more than any other critters in our house .
i mean we've got stuffed animals out of our ears .
you do ?
and books .
i mean we probably read with anna a lot i mean probably an hour a day and he's usually around .
but i don't think he particularly knows .
okay .
this is this and this is that .
or animal sounds that go but he thought it was funny when you were doing that .
i think he thought the jumping was funny i don't think he necessarily identified it as a frog .
so .
i think the action to him .
is more funny than the critter itself .
so you showed him the frog .
and we did the otter sea otter with eating and he didn't think that .
no .
that was at all entertaining .
i didn't try the baby with him but .
okay .
i don't know he's never permitted the baby at home it's annas .
i see .
so you said you did the goodnight moon is that right ?
alright and which one of those do you think he would prefer to look at with you something familiar or ?
i don't know he's also we got a couple of these caring cats books that are peek baby books .
and he seems to .
some days he really likes them some days he really doesn't .
i don't know .
i don't know we didn't get to this one .
peek a boo .
we have a couple of peek a boo books from the library that he thinks he'll get the giggles for one of them too .
do you play peek a boo with him ?
yes all the time and some days he thinks it's hilarious and some days he doesn't care .
i see .
so .
i see .
it depends on what he feels like doing .
just mood .
yes exactly .
i mean there's this one book that consistently he was just getting the giggles like just .
did you tell her that ?
yes so .
you funny .
i know he's a goof .
do you so you you have you said you have stuffed animals .
any other toys that are similar to what we have here ?
we don't have any food toys like this .
we have a lot of like rattles and teethable things you know baby rattles that are .
out for him little link chains and .
rattles that go on the ends of the linked chains and that kinda thing and he'll play with those .
okay so this kinda stuff the food the plates and stuff that's new to him ?
we have plates .
we don't have food which is interesting so .
we have plates and cups and he actually he has he has been doing that .
anna has a little set with cups with little handles like little tea cups and tea saucers that are plastic similar to this size .
and he's been into those lately and there's a water like a teapot that we use as a watering can that he's been trying to nab from her .
similar .
but long spout so he gets the spout in his mouth .
it's good to .
i see .
chew on .
he really went for the .
the plate .
plate this time .
let us see .
but i don't know that's cause it's a familiar object or because it fits nicely and it's easy to hold .
right easy to hold right .
cause it's light .
it's hard to know .
it's it's interesting in this study to see sometimes there's a big change even between the seven month visit and the ten month .
there's a huge developmental leap .
and sometimes even four weeks .
sometimes people we have .
buddy .
a ten a ten months sorta around visit and .
a eleven month and sometimes there's changes in two weeks if someone sees them two weeks later so .
it's amazing what they learn and how fast .
so so i suppose he's a little young to do pretend play .
feeding with dolls that's the question that probably .
probably better for a .
little bigger .
and does he is he interested in dolls at home ?
do you have some ?
in so much as he can chew on them .
okay .
not really as a an item in itself .
i mean it doesn't he doesn't seem to recognize .
the face or anything like that .
he doesn't get excited like that like he does with himself in the mirror .
you know it does have .
right .
that same level of woohoo .
right .
involved .
okay .
it may happen .
part of it is that every time he touches a doll anna whacks him so he might have been .
trained nicely to stay away from dolls .
he'll learn to be pretty tolerant though .
that's what i've found .
little ones tolerate a lot that's just .
you have to right .
we just hope you get bigger than her and pound her back some day .
that's right .
you gotta make sure they can't do that too .
paybacks buddy .
so you would i already asked you that .
he would prefer toys at this age .
if if he was on your lap would he .
want to be read to or turn or would he want to turn the pages himself ?
he wants to turn the pages himself .
okay .
okay i think that's about it unless you have anything that you think is noteworthy that i didn't ask you about his interest in toys and stuff at this age .
i don't know we have a dog and a cat .
he's very interested in them .
they're good toys .
and the dog follows him around constantly because he always has food in him he's a puky little dude so the dog follows him and licks puke off of him day in and day out so he's very .
we have one of those too .
interested in the dog .
yes i mean it's good to have a dog .
so totally disgusting but .
i know we could of brought taloula in .
that would be fun too .
he just he loves his sister he loves daddy you know his familiar people he just lights up like a christmas tree when he sees them .
no sorry .
no we didn't .
sorry just toys .
just stuff .
well i think that's about it .
okay .
then .
cool .
and i will just .
let us extricate you .
okay so i just have a couple questions .
okay so which toys did he seem most interested in ?
the soft stuff i think just because he could put it in his mouth .
like this clock .
i mean he's just into that phase right now where everything in his mouth is what he .
an toda like today in particular .
so i would say anything soft .
anything he can put his hands on .
he wasn't interested in making any kind of noise or anything like that .
like he is sometimes depending on the toys he has at home .
i would say the keys usually because they make noise .
he can see like he seems to be .
i don't know if this is possible yet but he seems to know that when he does something there's a reaction with the keys .
which of the toys seemed to interest him the least ?
i don't i don't think like he doesn't i think maybe this peanut butter because he doesn't recognize it .
i tried to make noise with it a little and that didn't seem to be didn't seem to do anything for him .
do you read books at home ?
yes .
you do .
like trying to read it without him grabbing it .
so we try to get through them as fast as we can .
because and then get on to the next book because he's not really looking at the pictures .
okay .
and do you think he recognizes names of any of these items ?
no .
i don't think so no .
were there any items that you think he's never seen before ?
well he's seen similar things .
but like this peanut butter that was new .
he has the winnie the pooh thing .
and my daughter has a lot of kitchen stuff .
this we don't have but he's got similar things .
do you have any toys that are the same at home ?
none that are the exact same .
no .
so you said you have some food but not .
okay if you hadta choose between books or toys would you say he prefers books or toys ?
i'd say toys .
definitely .
do you ever actually play with pretend food and pretend like you're feeding dolls at home ?
my daughter does with him .
and i mean he's around so i don't think .
i'm not doing it with him but she's doing it .
and he's wa and he's seeing her .
so i don't know if that counts as well as playing with him doing it .
okay .
does he ever play with dolls at home ?
not yet .
okay .
well i think that is all we have .
i have a little follow up questions questions .
i can play with caroline .
okay .
while you're jodi can .
sure can i is it okay if i let her out of here ?
can come out .
come with me caroline .
mommy's going to answer some questions .
ask you some questions .
okay .
going to be writing anything down because we're going to use the tape .
okay .
transcription .
okay .
so which of the toys seem to interest caroline the most ?
i think .
the .
cookie that she ate .
and maybe this towards the end and the kangaroo on only if i was working it .
okay and which do you think is a good toy for her personality ?
maybe the bumble bee .
she likes things with faces and then she also likes things too that are like tactile .
okay .
so which of the toys seem to interest caroline the least ?
the books .
the books ?
and why do you think that ?
i think it's my older daughter was like this too and like for a certain period of a couple months .
she's just too antsy to to sit and look at a book .
like if if you could be mobile and use a book she she would be better off i think .
okay so one of the questions is do you think she prefers books or toys ?
toys definitely .
okay .
if you hadta pick a book which book did she prefer to look at with you ?
of the ones here ?
honey !
the book that we were looking at before you guys came in she liked a lot .
it was like a pop up and a tactile one .
but then this tactile one i think i think her being in the in the seat .
made it hard for her to sit .
do you want me to take her ?
what happened ?
what happened ?
that was a close one .
i do have a binky with me but i don't know where i p .
no it's in here .
alright you .
and i'm also guilty of not reading too many books with her lately .
because i because it's hard .
she squirms out of my lap and stuff .
so .
okay .
i'm not sure if that was what you were questioning me about or not .
do you have any toys like these at home ?
we have a lot of soft toys .
we don't have any puppets .
i might try puppets .
and her older sister plays with all the play food and stuff .
which she of course doesn't you know do pretend play .
but she mouths .
a lot .
and we do have books all over .
but she's not interested in books at home like on her own either .
does she ever play with dolls at home ?
she climbs .
on them haha .
okay .
but no not yet .
not in any meaningful manner .
that's about it .
okay .
thank you very much .
you're welcome .
for coming .
a few questions ?
sure .
about this session .
which toys do you think amelia seemed most interested in ?
anything .
haha !
i mean at this point i can .
you know .
give her .
a napkin and she's happy so .
it ha .
anything she's .
she can have with the most toys .
or non toys .
haha .
which toys here do you think she was most interested in ?
she seems to like the .
peekaboo you know the .
the food .
she also .
we'd actually don't have a baby at home .
she kinda likes that .
i think .
she likes head shoulders knees and toes .
so she was definitely smiling .
when i was doing that .
on the baby .
which toy do you think is good for her personality ?
haha is that yummy ?
anything really i mean at this point .
as long as she can put it in her mouth .
it makes her happy .
so .
what do you think interests her ?
she likes f .
she likes faces .
see .
haha .
she looked over at you a couple times .
so .
you know .
she's like why isn't she looking back at me ?
she likes .
you know like when my camera .
when i take pictures of her and it .
makes noises .
she likes that .
but we tend to not actually have very many .
toys that require batteries on around the house .
yes .
so .
it may just because .
it may be .
that she likes that type of thing because she's not .
used to it as much .
i do not know .
which one do you think she was least ?
which toys here .
do you think she was least interested in ?
she seems sorta interested in the books .
but she tends not to be very into books .
okay .
she tries to close them most the time haha .
and she didn't really care about .
and we never even got over there .
okay .
so .
some of the food .
she didn't really care .
about .
okay .
do you think that there are any items that .
actually .
we'll that can be for next time .
haha .
that will be good .
that's a good plate ?
which book .
do you think amelia would ?
prefer to read ?
or look at with you ?
it this the baby peekaboo or .
we didn't look at it but the on the farm .
okay .
she liked .
she likes the peekaboo ones .
and does she play with any similar toys at home ?
we don't have .
food at home .
like i said we have the book that's like this one .
i was stacking these because we stack a lot of things and .
okay .
you know like stacking toys .
so .
and i'm .
although .
as i said .
that i'm going to regret it .
but i'm always .
ha showing her how to bang things together .
haha ha .
which fortunately she doesn't seem to care about at this point .
so .
okay .
and do you think she's more ?
prefers books or toys ?
toys .
she preferred .
okay .
and you said that she doesn't have a doll at home ?
no .
okay .
she has a lot of stuffed animals .
but no dolls .
and you said you don't have any pretend food at home ?
no .
but do you think that amelia maybe recognized any of the foods ?
from maybe home ?
probably not because she's still eating so much .
baby food .
that .
you know i don't .
i don't think she'd necessarily recognize .
and she's actually usually goes to bed before we eat dinner .
so .
i don't .
i don't think so .
okay .
and at this point do you think amelia recognizes ?
the names of any of these items ?
or is beginning to ?
the only one that i would say would be .
milk .
we do .
we're starting a little bit of sign language with her .
and we do milk and eat and more .
and so she's actually started signing milk .
we're not really sure if she knows .
that it's .
goes with milk .
you know she's started doing this .
but we don't know if she's doing it .
at the times when she's hungry .
but when we ask her if she wants milk .
if she's hungry she usually smiles so .
i don't know if that means she .
knows what it means or not .
or if she's just happy that .
you know likes when we talk to her .
are there any items that aren't here that you think your child recognizes the name of ?
no .
not yet .
okay .
is that yummy ?
you want more pizza here ?
yummy .
yummy .
would it be okay if i asked you some questions ?
sure .
what do you think rosie liked playing the most with today ?
well it seems like she found her two favorite things .
she's liked the keys .
and i think the measuring spoon probably the best .
does she have those at home ?
no .
she has like .
a toy key ring .
that's like kind of similar .
that's a teether .
she likes to kind of make the same noises as that .
what do you think was her least favorite ?
well .
what do you think ?
she seemed to like this stuffed animal with these guys .
but in general .
she didn't seem to go for any other stuffed animals .
she likes more of the stuff she can make noises with .
that has some more .
kind of plastic .
crunches and stuff .
do you think that she is familiar with the names of the animals ?
of those ?
no .
probably not .
well we talk about bees but i don't know if she would associate that with a bee .
but we don't really talk about foxes .
or donkeys .
frogs maybe .
otters don't really come up .
goslings and fawns no .
how about the food is she eating or using a spoon to eat ?
she will try to take the spoon out of my hand .
when i feed her and .
sometimes we will give her own spoon .
and for food .
visually similar .
we have never had ice cream cones in front of her .
we have eaten sandwiches and stuff .
but i don't think i don't think any of these look visually enough like we eat for her .
for her to make that connection .
she has seen us eat a lot of cheese slices .
and lately we have been giving her little bits of that .
so that would probably be the one most similar .
does she play with baby dolls at home ?
you know soft plush kind of dolls .
but they don't look like babies .
you know a yarn knit kitten .
she likes that .
all the other baby dolls that she has she hasn't got into yet .
how about the books do you read books at home ?
we read books a lot .
at home .
and sometimes she shows more interest then others .
sometimes you know she will she will just get it out to gnaw on it .
sometimes she will actually turn pages .
kind of play with it .
and then gnaw half way through .
but we have books .
a lot of books upstairs downstairs .
in the nursery .
in the car .
do you have any of the same books at home ?
no we haven't had any doctor seuss books at home .
we have this one but it looks different .
it's not the counting one .
but none of the doctor seuss ones we have at home .
do you think she is familiar with any of the animal names or sounds ?
she she i would think she would be familiar with .
because we do a lot with cows .
the of the bee .
we do rooster sounds at home .
so sounds like that .
the animal like cows and stuff .
she could be familiar with and colors .
which this one had a lot of colors .
and we do we do read lots of books .
that have colors that you say .
i think .
i think .
how about any games like peekaboo pattycake that kind of stuff ?
yes we play those at home a lot .
and she she really likes pattycake .
she hasn't figured out what to do but but when you talk about pattycake and when you do it with her she smiles .
and gets animated .
and excited .
she thinks that's fun .
peekaboo she is starting to get more into now .
where she will you know pull the little burp cloth off my head .
if i put it on me and find me .
or pull it off herself .
and we say peekaboo so that's a fun game .
i know .
you want to be up .
well one thing that i notice whenever she is somewhere new with new toys .
she will kind of sit .
and observe for a while .
you know she will she will get whats near her .
but she kinda is an observer in the beginning .
she will get comfortable and familiar .
and then she will start to verbalize or vocalize .
kind of get interested and going a little farther .
to get stuff .
but at home where she knows most of the toys .
when we set her down .
she just starts going you know .
so as we get as we go for playdates places and stuff .
in the beginning she will just sort of sit and hold court .
and look around .
maybe reach for something or play with what you give her .
and be very quiet .
and then she will start .
kind of getting a little more expressive .
so i think this held .
true to that that she kind of sat and .
looked around and found something nearby like the bee .
and then when she got a little bit more comfortable then she would go find other stuff .
she wanted .
but lately especially as she's kind of .
in the last few weeks .
hit this kind of milestone of getting more comfortable crawling .
going up to standing lately .
that's been more entertaining to her .
its like toys don't even have to be there .
if she can just crawl on you .
stand up .
pull on stuff .
it's like everything except her toys will interest her .
at this point .
i just want to stand .
that's the best game of all .
much to mommy to grin .
right ?
because we just stand in our crib .
now .
you want that .
you can sit down and get that .
let us see which one rosie .
i think you kind of were more interested in the sounds .
one maybe .
i think you were more interested when we said like .
and .
do you like the sounds better ?
i think so .
i think that was your favorite .
so the sound effects ?
i think the book of wonderful noises .
i did it i said it .
that was me .
well i think that was it for today .
cool .
i'm just going to ask you a couple of questions .
and so which toys do you think are the most interesting to him ?
and do you think they're good for his personality ?
i think the ones that he can chew on are the ones that he likes the best .
i'm actually surprised he didn't try to chew on your books .
he enjoys that a lot at home .
okay .
does he play with similar toys at home ?
we've got i don't know what other things like this ?
he likes to chew on books .
we've got little blocky things plasticy things we stack .
and then he's got some .
mostly he chews on things .
mostly he chews on books .
haha and books like the like the he got a plastic chewy one .
i haven't gotten him .
i mean he's got little blocks whatever .
i haven't gotten him tons of toys because christmas is coming up .
so which ones do you think he was the least interested in ?
the stuffed toys .
i i tried to show him a couple of those .
he didn't .
didn't really even look twice .
alright so do you do you think there are any toys here that he didn't know the name of ?
like if you said ".
like this is a frog .
do you think he would know ?
i don't think so .
you don't think so ?
i don't think so .
he might know dog and cat .
but i don't know that he knows any .
no !
so you would say that he prefers books over toys you think ?
only in the sense that you can chew on them haha .
but he likes to be read to .
but i mean he likes these kind of things .
anything he can put in his mouth you said .
haha .
anything he can put in his mouth .
does your he play with any like dolls or figures at home ?
what has he got ?
not really .
i mean i've got him a like a little lovie thing in his crib .
he just he ignores that .
we've got some stuffed things that make noise .
he likes when i play with them .
and they make noise .
but he doesn't seek out .
the ducks !
you like your ducks ?
he does like ducks .
he's got he's got some we got some floatie ducks .
that's the thing i think he likes the best .
but again he sticks the head in his mouth like a pacifier .
but he does like his duckies .
is there anything else you think we should know about his play at this time ?
that i haven't asked about already ?
i dont i don't know .
it pretty much .
he likes tupperware too .
okay .
i'm trying to i'm like trying to think like what do we got ?
we're got .
i don't know .
we got little things .
i thought he would like these because he's got he's got keys at home that he likes .
i thought he'd like these .
but he didn't .
alright well .
i guess because he's gotten new and exciting things .
okay i think we're just about done .
so .
what do you think daniel liked playing with the most today ?
well he is liking the keys right now .
he he loves this book at home .
he will i don't know pick it up all the time .
and he laughs a lot .
and he likes books with the well he likes anything with different textures .
i thought .
he would grab one of these out of my hands but he did not .
the one with the animals ?
do you think he's familiar with any of the ones .
no .
none of them even remotely like anything we have at home .
so that's probably it too .
the keys we have keys at home so .
but not there different .
how about the names of any of the animals ?
i don't think he would know .
maybe maybe .
no .
i don't think he would know any of these * m s .
maybe a chicken .
he might say that occasionally .
certainly not an otter .
there are two otters .
what about so the books at home .
we have we have these two .
and plenty others .
we we .
read .
a lot .
so .
he tries to .
i do not know .
he likes to pick up books and eat them anyway .
i don't know if he actually cares about .
words but .
he really likes to pick up that book .
i'm sorry ?
well he likes to pick up books anyway .
and his favorite .
book .
at home is yellow also .
does he do you read a lot of doctor seuss in particular .
we just read whatever we have .
though he does like this book a great deal .
sometimes he laughs just on the first page .
do you think he knows what is it called ?
mister ?
mister brown can can you ?
okay .
so you do all the sounds when you go through it .
anytime that i .
do like animal noises he laughs .
well not any kind anymore .
now he's more particular he'll only laugh at the really funny ones but .
did you just spit up dan ?
alright .
hold on a second let me .
get something .
but yes he he .
likes .
hearing animal noises .
i think it's just because it's .
mom and dad making sounds that we don't usually make that he knows we're not supposed to make .
that he recognizes as not normal .
do you think you played similar to how you would at home ?
maybe .
he .
was completely uninterested in all this stuff .
he didn't even look at it which was kinda weird .
usually if there's an array of toys like this at home he would be diving into four different ones so .
i usually wouldn't offer him that many at once .
just because it would because he wouldn't focus on any one thing he would just dive into every separate thing .
so he wasn't interested did he play with the food ?
he didn't even look at it .
like it's all within the reach .
i mean he you see he was able to reach over and grab .
the books .
and could easily reach forward and grab those i know he can .
but he didn't even like look at them .
at home ?
we don't have any of this stuff at home yet .
does he play more at home books than toys ?
no .
he'll play with whatever he's got .
in the room .
kind of considers these as his toys also but like .
he has .
i do not know .
balls and blocks .
trains and things .
he does have some stuffed animals .
they just don't look like these .
alright .
about the right size though .
we do have a couple puppets .
but we haven't gotten them out yet .
what parts of the story .
you said it was the sound effects ?
and then .
and the books that have textures .
he's just discovering that he can touch the textures .
he likes that .
do you think he recognizes any of the names of the animals in the book on the farm ?
no .
maybe maybe once he's actually seen some of the animals in person but .
i don't think he recognizes them .
i think he like i said he recognizes that the sounds are not sounds that people make .
mhmm .
and so in that sense he knows that there funny .
did he want to play with the baby doll today or ?
i don't know if he's ever even seen one .
i mean we don't have siblings and we only have enough toys for his appropriate age .
so i don't think .
he's just never seen one that i can think of .
okay .
so his favorite thing .
i think i heard you say was were the books right today ?
or the keys you said .
well .
right now i would go back to the books .
we have that book at home too .
the foot book .
and his least favorite thing ?
well i tried .
even this i tried to pass him this .
stuffed animals i would say actually .
the stuffed animals would have to be least favorite .
least favorite today ?
there he goes going towards the food .
yellow i think that he likes yellow .
it's fuzzy .
so it could be you know .
colors and sounds .
alright .
could also just be things he's able to pick up .
anything he can put in his mouth right ?
like i said i would assume that you clean everything between children being here .
but .
we definitely have to do that .
well alright .
should i pass you this back ?
good job little will .
i'm going to ask you some questions about the play session .
and i'm not going to write anything down because we have the audio .
so .
probably the spoon .
i think he loved to .
chew on it and hold it and .
you know anything he likes i mean that's that's something very s something that he's very familiar with .
and something that's fun to hold and to chew on and .
these he plays with these at home .
somewhat and .
probably just things that are just squishy that are he l that are nice things to hold in his hand .
and texture feels fun he likes to chew on them he's teething .
i think the baby is was definitely had interest in the baby because he likes faces and .
his little br my mother gave his big brother a baby .
doll that he doesn't really play with .
and so i think he just likes faces so that's definitely of interest .
in contrast which which of the toys did you see sorry which of the toys interested him the least ?
well this this thing i think didn't the texture didn't feel good on his his face when i was kind of playing with it so .
he made made a really disgusted .
face .
i don't know i think anything he likes things that make noise and things that are .
movement so if you know the tower he likes the towers and .
the book didn't seem to interest him at all .
particularly .
do you think any of those books you know in a a day obviously when you weren't aren't here any of those books would interest him or ?
i would say like books with faces babies he likes to look at that .
he certainly is read a lot to .
but more because i'm reading to his older son before bed .
and he's sitting on my lap too .
and so maybe he has the second child syndrome .
little wills don't don't sit chew on this .
that he doesn't get read t doesn't get as much personal attention as his older brother i think .
k so in t me re picking out like age appropriate books it just doesn't happen as much .
we read good night moon a lot .
this is not good night moon i know but .
so i don't know .
are there any toys that are similar ?
i know you said you have the kind of a baby doll at home .
are there any toys at home that are here or any toys here that are similar to ones that you have at home ?
well he has a sippycup .
he's familiar with that .
he we don't have any .
play food or anything like that .
but i mean in terms of the shape like i mean we have .
he has blocks .
his brother is playing with legos the duplos a lot .
i don't know if the shapes are .
not really similar .
keys we have a set of keys .
he has a set of toys keys he does .
right you have some some keys that look a little bit like this ?
so i know you said that you don't have much toy food at home is there anything anything besides the sippycup that you think he would have recognized ?
he would certainly recognize all of these as toys .
things that he could would be fair game anyway .
but we have we have little beaniebabies .
but .
he doesn't take much interest in them .
he doesn't touch them or stroke them or pick them up .
i mean he he's chewed on th picked them up and chewed on them before .
and at this point do you think that there are any names any names of these toys now that he would recognize like if you you know it seems like you know baby you know that kind of a familiar thing are there ?
spoon for sure .
probably .
cup .
plate for sure .
book for sure .
probably about it .
i mean toast .
what's the matter wills ?
what's the matter ?
maybe some of the animals maybe he would rec like .
i mean horse or teddy bear or something like that maybe .
but that's about it probably .
okay alright well great thank you so much and we can go ahead and get the mic from you .
okay .
go play .
go play .
so what do you think he liked playing with the most ?
these animals .
we don't have these at home .
we don't have any of those stuffed animals .
so i think those were completely different for him .
he does have keys that he carries ar that he uses all the time .
so he did like these .
too .
okay .
or his other ones .
those were his two favorite things ?
i think so .
and we don't have any of these these plastic foods .
so i think that was interesting .
but we do have a lot of books .
but he didn't seem that interested in them here .
so .
okay .
with regards to the animals were were some of the names familiar to him ?
like from books or ?
definitely the dog and .
like a .
and the fox would be the two that i think were familiar .
okay .
so the other ones i would not so much .
no .
which ones do you think were like really .
uncommon for him ?
in terms of the names like the zebra and the frog .
goodness .
winnie the pooh we haven't done .
one second .
okay .
okay .
i'll be out soon .
no .
it's okay .
anticipating .
that .
sorry about that .
that's okay .
so definitely like the dog and the fox i know we have stories about .
and .
but like winnie the pooh he's not familiar with .
because i'm not writing anything down .
something happened to the .
was it .
like a .
there it is .
there it is .
okay .
okay .
just .
so .
how do you play with the how did you play with the animals today ?
did you think that he liked it ?
well today what i i only did was i just like put them infront of him and named them .
i think other ways i could have done it is to kind of get go on this side .
and use different voices to play with him .
and i didn't do that .
but that would be something else that i could do too .
okay .
and then the food .
do you think it was was there where there any names or colors or looks that look were familiar to him ?
do you think ?
no .
not yet .
i don't .
he doesn't really eat anything like this yet .
i think he was attracted to the like the he really liked the icecream cone and the peas .
those are the his two favorites .
and he's eaten peas .
but they don't look like that when he eats them .
so .
and he hasn't had icecream yet .
so .
okay .
how did you play with the food ?
did you try .
how did you play with it ?
it was kind of the same thing .
just kind of putting it infront of him and naming it .
and then trying to build things .
so i guess showing him how you would use the food .
in real life .
but you can't .
i would have a more difficult time i guess getting creative with that than i would with the animals .
i can see that .
did you like build meals and things ?
i tried to .
they weren't necessarily meals you'd eat together .
like waffles and peas you wouldn't put together .
but trying to put stuff together .
okay .
was he at all interested in the baby doll ?
he was interested in looking at it .
and he smiled at it .
so and we don't have any dolls at home either .
so i think he he was he was just interested in looking at the face .
but he wasn't interested in touching it or anything .
okay .
does he play play with other infants ?
maybe ?
he does play with other infants .
because he is in daycare a couple days a week .
so he's with like there's six of them in a room .
including him .
and and they all know each other .
because they've been there f for a while .
so he he'll react to those infants .
and then the books .
we have this one at home .
and we have this one at home .
but these .
the two that i read we don't have at home .
but we have a lot of books .
we we go to the library to get the books .
so they kinda change differently .
so but normally he really likes those .
okay .
do you play ever play like pattycake ?
we do .
but today you didn't do any like extraneous outside like outside of these toys today ?
no just the .
but and he just learned how to clap so its its that's patty cakes pretty fun for him .
and peekaboo ?
he loves boo .
at home too we do that .
and so he sits and listens .
if you were to say toys versus books here today what do you think ?
i think he would understand .
because we or at least we have like a play area and then we have like a big basket of books .
and so whenever he sees us pull out the big basket he'll like shriek .
you know that's kind of how he shows happiness right now .
and i don't know .
maybe it's because we cuddle with him more when we read .
and we both will read to him .
both my husband and i .
but he seems to get happy and then he'll like shriek while we're reading sometimes too .
but he's also .
just started scooting so he's really interested in moving right now .
so .
but so at home he it was .
i guess you just gave me a comparison .
at home he seemed a little bit more interested or excited about books .
well because we don't just leave them out because their library books .
so when we bring them out he knows we're going to read to him and then he he gets happy .
where as his toys we kinda just leave out .
you know so he can get them whenever he wants .
okay that makes sense .
that's so funny .
he's like looking at the baby and saying ".
what are you eyeing at ?
it's my clock .
okay well great !
i i think that's it .
got through all the questions .
he can keep playing while we talk .
okay .
you keep chewing on those keys .
say there good eating .
so .
which toys do you think he was most interested here ?
i think he likes he likes books but he prefers i think the hard toys you can bang and beat and stack .
that seems to be what he goes for the most .
which ones were the least interesting ?
probably the doll or the stuffed animals .
as he reaches for them .
proves me wrong .
probably the doll then .
because he had no interest in the doll .
do you have toys like these at home ?
yes we have all everything but the doll .
books stuffed animals and .
then all these kinda toys .
do you think that he would prefer to look at a book or play with toys ?
depends on his mood .
probably play with toys more than look at a book .
he loses interest in books pretty quickly but .
he'll he likes the the lift flap books the best .
so if you have those then he look at those for a while longer .
do you have any of these books at home ?
yes .
we have several of these and then lots of the doctor seuss books .
do you think that there are any items that he would recognize the name of ?
not yet .
not if you told him to get something he wouldn't find it or look at it .
not yet .
what about the food items do you think he would know any of those ?
does he eat any of them at home or ?
he eats them but they don't look like that .
the peas definitely don't look like peas you know .
he's still in jar food so .
but probably not he probably wouldn't recognize you know what they were .
let's see .
and you said you don't have dolls at home right ?
no .
is there anything else you .
you want the book ?
think we should know about his play ?
maybe things he didn't do here or toys that he has at home that he doesn't play with here ?
no not really .
most of his toys are some of them are loud and musical and stuff like that where he hasta push buttons to make you know it make music or noises or whatever and .
he will do that .
where you going ?
you done ?
here .
but no most of these are the same type toys we have at home .
same things he plays with .
what ?
here you want to read ?
you want to lift the flaps up ?
peekaboo .
is there anything else you think we should know in general ?
no .
not that i can think of .
okay we're all done here .
okey dokey .
laughs .
that's a pretty interesting carpet isn't it ?
look .
doing the obstacle course now ?
you're a happy girl though .
such a great job .
so donna what do you think interested her the most in terms of what we have here .
types of toys .
the amount of toys ?
she seemed to like these a lot .
just .
the shaking and .
think it was .
just making sounds and stuff .
i think i think it's .
are there any that you see that you think are good in particular for her type of personality the kind of kid that she is at this point ?
i think she likes she likes things that she can manipulate .
a lot so that's why i didn't really go for these because i didn't think that she'd be into .
you know something .
to just look at and hold .
although i think she liked feeling the textures a little bit .
i see .
but .
but do you think ?
but she she seems to be more interested in things that she can kind of .
manipulate .
and ac actually at home she just likes to play with like pieces of paper and crumple them up and .
i know she likes to put things in her mouth a lot too but she .
she likes things that she can kind of do something with .
at your belly .
so the toys that she could make a sound with do you feel like those were that type of a thing and she probably likes that for that reason ?
i think she .
she seemed to be more interested in that .
does she .
she likes things that she can shake and .
i was going to say does she have any toys like that at home ?
we've got little teethers and things .
i think i left the one in the car that i .
that i brought with us but it's like .
a teether and it's got little rings on it .
and so she can kind of shake them and she can feel them and .
move them move them around .
the rings around and stuff .
she likes that .
i think i know what you're talking about there's .
they're making some really good things for babies these days .
this one's like a a butterfly and the wings are kinda crinkly .
so they make a crackly sound ?
okay .
she likes that .
she likes that .
did she see a book that she liked in particular in the book bin did you think ?
she didn't really seem to go for one in particular .
i mean she i think she looked at that one with the ducks on the cover maybe .
a little bit .
a second or two longer so that's why i pulled that one out for her .
but .
does she have a favorite book or books at home that you have that she likes she likes to look at with you ?
not really .
i have you know it's really sad i have so little time to spend alone with her because because i have two two and a half year olds .
and .
that's understandable !
that is !
i was just wondering if she's attached sometimes .
she also still .
it seems like she likes some of the cloth books we have that have also again squeakers and crinkly things and things that make noise .
around the side perhaps .
i'm not writing anything down donna because we're getting it on there so i don't have to write .
just attach it over here .
okay .
that's right .
you want to check everything out !
so i was going to say it sounds like she .
you want to check it all out ?
prefers toys over books would you say that's .
true ?
at this point .
i .
i don't know that i've spent enough time reading to her that she's maybe hasn't been exposed to books that much .
maybe one of the subsequent visits that will be more clear .
you know we'll see how she changes over time .
do you .
it's also funny for me i i know .
usually when i play with her i'm holding her like this .
right .
so it's kinda funny for me to to have her in front of me and .
exactly .
it was a little bit unnatural for me but .
i see okay that's interesting to know .
so if you did play with her she'd be more like this ?
a lot of times i spend sitting with her like this .
and she .
often doesn't just doesn't like being put down .
so i think .
she likes .
she's just in a in a really good mood right now and she's .
you know .
she sure is .
so she did fine with that .
she's feeling pretty secure .
at home a lot of time she cries .
if she's put down on the floor because maybe she thinks i'm going to go run off and do something else .
she likes to be close to you .
she does .
this is she might be too young i mean we're just wondering if if she's interested in pretend food at all .
or those kinds of things or dolls anything like that .
at home ?
i mean you already told me that she really likes things she can manipulate so .
she can .
kinda like this .
she can play with but she has a little .
like it's a humpty dumpty just like a little soft toy .
it's got a hole in the middle of it so she can kind of hold on to it and she seems to like that but mostly she likes .
you like action ?
she likes action .
you like to shake and make noise and see what will happen if you do this to that .
is that what it's about right now ellie ?
that sounds about right .
doesn't it ?
she's got something it's like a soft block and then i think it's got .
trying to remember .
it's like it's got a little bell inside so when she shakes it kind of jingles and then it it's got different little textures on it and things .
i've seen some like that some of them have things on the sides like a mirror .
i think it has a mirror on it .
and it's got a little flap .
it just has like a pattern on the outside and then when you lift the flap there's a picture of a bear underneath .
so she sometimes likes that one ?
she likes to play with that one .
very cool .
cool .
okay well are there any sort of .
toy related things that i didn't ask you that you think are are pertinent to what she's interested in at this point ?
toys or objects or things ?
i think .
she ends up kind of crawling amongst her sisters' toys a lot so .
she .
you're influenced ?
she is very influenced by the two year olds and .
you know so a lot of the like smaller plush toys and little teethers and things that i had when her sisters were infants i just haven't even really taken out for her because it's just too much stuff .
so she's happy enough crawling among their things right .
she is and they have a lot of like cars you know not not things .
that you know have small pieces or anything like that .
right .
just things that .
things that .
things you might not normally buy for a seven month old .
but she's getting exposed to them anyway .
well that's very good .
okay well that's all i needed to ask you at this point .
okay .
so we can .
and you did such a great job ellie .
couldn't have asked for a better happier baby .
have to remember that to bring a bottle with me next time too .
okay .
alright .
you can keep playing .
okay .
was there a particular group of toys that she seemed most interested in .
the books .
okay .
books .
she hasn't left there in since i sat her down .
okay .
do you have any idea why that might be ?
we have a lot of books at home .
we're a book reading family .
her big sister reads books constantly .
do you have any of these ?
we have goodnight moon in the in a different version not the counting version .
we do have a peek a baby but not that one .
we have a a where is mommy but that same .
series .
okay .
what about which group was she least interested in ?
seemed to be the play toy the play food .
this one .
why would you say that ?
well every time i tried to give her a piece she would look at it for s you know she would hold it but then she would put it down and go right back to the books or to the the bee she had over here .
so .
do you have any play sets at home ?
we do .
we have tea sets and play food and and she plays with them when her big sister is playing with them .
but not usually on her own .
okay .
she did .
she really likes this bee .
i think the the contrasting colors really got her .
but she she didn't want to come over here and check any out .
okay .
she wanted to stay with the books .
do you think she might recognize any animals ?
probably not .
i mean she know she might know winnie the pooh and frogs but not .
i'm talking about you .
careful .
you're standing on a book silly .
there we go .
what about dolls do you guys have dolls at home ?
we have dolls everywhere .
has she played with them ?
she would like to but again big sister they're her dolls .
even the dolls that are hers that are for mackenzie's only jackie tends to take .
so she doesn't get much of a chance to play .
when she's not that interested in them other than to like gum on them and then throw them down so .
okay .
i don't she's kinda young but might she recognize any of the foods we have ?
probably not .
no .
no .
she doesn't eat any of them yet so .
she's still on baby food and bottles .
okay .
she actually she might recognize the bottle .
i was a little hesitant to give it to her only because she's getting to be the time when it's her bottle time .
and i didn't want her to like scream at me .
for taking it away .
yes .
okay .
i think you're all done .
what else is there anything else about like the way she plays at home ?
okay .
favorite toys or anything ?
she no she doesn't shh i mean she doesn't really have any favorite toys .
she she likes to follow what her big sister is doing .
okay .
and play with that .
or play with things i don't want her to play with which is pretty normal but .
she does have a favorite lamb stuffed animal kinda like this size that she sleeps with and cuddles when she's upset .
okay .
but not really a play toy .
okay .
okay !
i think we are all done .
we briefly looked at the icecream cone and he saw the waffle .
the waffle anything else ?
no .
he didn't go there really .
any of this stuff or ?
i picked it up but he didn't really pay attention when i looked at it .
okay .
what other items did he like to play with ?
he loved the keys .
and the spoon .
and the foam clock .
and we read the book put me in the zoo .
you going to the zoo ?
and we did the white played with the white seal a little bit .
does he have any does he like play dolls or things like that at home ?
well with being a brother he doesn't have any dolls at home .
right now he plays with a lot of like rings that stack .
and he has a couple of musical toys like drums and those kinds of things he really plays a lot with .
and books a little bit .
do you remember what else you showed him maybe ?
he briefly looked at the doll but he had no interest .
none ?
i showed it to him and he's like .
he just smacked it in the head with the keys .
you don't like these do you ?
unless it's a real one ?
you like icecream ?
say i haven't really tried it yet .
probably a good thing .
i guess with an older brother there's not many dolls in the house ?
no .
okay .
well .
i'm sure by next time he'll be more want to venture more .
he didn't even blink did her ?
do you see this over here ?
what is that ?
does it look rea ?
no ?
no interest ?
no .
it's real enough .
i know !
i don't understand why he's just like no .
no dolls .
nope .
especially not that kind .
you going to tell her about it ?
you like to talk .
you are cute .
my goodness .
don't put that in your mouth !
it's okay they clean them all after .
but i'm trying to teach him not to put everything in his mouth .
otherwise it'd be everything ?
how you doing ?
you're a talkative guy .
say i gotta make sure i keep my attention span with everybody .
since my brother likes to take it away .
older siblings do that don't they ?
are you a younger sibling ?
no i'm an older .
me too .
i talked for my brother .
poor kid didn't talk .
he's bigger than you though .
he's twenty one .
you love keys don't you ?
you think you want to drive a car ?
that'll be the day .
i think you're a little too small to see over the steering wheel .
for the short people .
he can still play .
hehe say great !
hehe .
great !
i'm just going to ask you a few questions .
what do you think she liked playing with the most ?
here ?
probably the soft plush toys .
either that or the books .
but probably probably the soft plush toys .
do you have any of these at ho any of these toys at home .
nothing identical .
nope .
i mean we have soft toys .
and we have books .
are they animals ?
that are toys ?
are they ?
she has a little buddy .
that she likes but it .
looks .
very different its not at all like that .
do you think she prefers playing with books or toys ?
at home ?
she prefers playing with things she can put in her mouth .
so i don't know if there is a big difference between books and toys .
as long as it's roughly bite sized .
okay .
that makes sense .
do you think she'd recognize the names of any of the things you played with today ?
i don't know .
i don't think so .
i mean maybe maybe she knows the word book .
maybe .
maybe .
any of like the animal names or .
i don't think so .
body parts ?
i mean .
i think sometimes she knows nose .
and i think sometimes she knows feet .
because we talk about noses and feet .
a lot for some reason .
and i think she knows the word for dog .
but we didn't play with the dog .
today but we have dogs at home .
and i think she knows that one .
do you ever play with baby dolls at home ?
no .
i don't know why .
we don't .
she has a little picnic package at home .
that's soft .
it's like a picnic basket .
and it has stuff to make a sandwich .
like a chicken leg and a banana .
she likes that cause she can chew on it .
hehe .
so .i don't know if that falls into the fake food or the plush category .
but it's it's definitely bite sized .
okay .
she .
it's her primary requirement .
alright were there any is there anything here you thought she would like the least ?
no .
i mean i didn't even try with the baby doll i guess .
but .
i don't know why .
maybe cause she looks a little unhappy .
when i open .
but haha .
haha .
what about the the books and toys ?
that you have around here .
ha .
that one that if you hadta pick one that would .
that she didn't like ?
the most disinterested let us say .
m .
maybe the zebra .
and the goodnight moon .
i mean it's it would be pretty arbitrary for me to say .
yes she liked this no she didn't like that because .
i think she pretty much enjoyed all of them .
she loved the little caterpillar guy that you guys just gave her !
she loved this !
hehe .
is it was that her prize ?
hehe .
that's good .
that's good .
and then the books that you have at home cause i notice here you have a lot of you guys chose a lot of books here .
any of the similar like .
we have .
other books by this author .
and we have other doctor seuss books .
she's read goodnight moon .
we don't have it at home but she sees it at her cousin's house .
so and she has she has a farm animal book that's similar to this it's .
not exactly the same but it's like touch and feel with farm animals .
so yah she has she has similar books to .
all of these * m s .
okay .
so she's she's probably seen all different the animals in them .
okay well i think that that's it that was simple and easy hehe .
easy enough .
thank you so much for coming in .
actually don't needta write anything down .
so .
because i'm recording .
it'll pick up my place .
how did you feel how do you think she .
this kind of compared to how you play at home usually ?
this is a lot more one-on-one time than she gets at home .
okay .
and who are you usually playing with .
nathan .
well i try to play with both of them but .
he's a little more demanding .
of the attention .
okay .
so she gets a little more attention now .
does she have did you find that you play with similar things at home ?
we've got .
a play food .
we've more trucks at home .
lot more trucks .
she likes the trucks .
we have books .
we don't have a lot of stuffed animals .
i think she has one .
okay .
are .
did you say you have play food ?
we do .
have play food .
but that's normally in the kitchen and we're we normally play in the living room .
so she really plays with a lot more trucks .
she always .
has a lot more trucks .
are her brothers ?
trucks and building blocks and .
things like that .
well that's good .
pieces of floor mat .
sorry .
no you're fine you were absolutely fine this is actually .
anything .
the .
what do you think she recognizes the names at least or finds familiar any of the names for some of the toys that .
play food .
i don't think so .
i don't think so .
cause you don't need any of this stuff yet .
what would you play with from this pile that you that .
we played with the spaghetti the waffles the peas .
the cookies the pizza .
the icecream cones .
and now she's just playing with the juice .
i think that's about it .
she got the box of peas .
do you think she .
i mean do you have those in your set do you have those in like .
we have spaghetti .
we have pizza .
i don't think i have icecream .
i don't think we have peas .
i know we have cookies .
so .
do you think that .
she was kind of more familiar with those or she just happened to .
the color was what do you think attracted to her .
i think she liked .
she's i don't know i think she likes to pick things up and stick them in her mouth .
do you like to pick things up and stick them in your mouth ?
on our spaghetti the meatballs aren't attached .
it's a separate piece .
i always thought maybe .
maybe because it's not all white ?
is our spaghetti all white ?
do you do you think she enjoys reading books or playing .
with toys more ?
she doesn't get a lot to read a lot of books .
so i think she likes playing with the toys more .
okay .
with nathan you know .
everyday we read books .
with her not so much .
we just .
don't hold still long enough to read books .
we just don't hold still .
do you think she enjoyed it today ?
i think so .
hopefully .
she didn't pay much attention to me reading the book .
okay .
she was too busy playing with the toys .
okay how about .
other games that you might play like .
earlier you had been playing .
like chase or something but .
or like pattycake or even what like the book you were playing with the book earlier .
the peekaboo ?
we don't play any of those .
okay .
she just doesn't .
i feel bad but .
you're like doing your study like first kid second kid .
i mean no it's absolutely trust me that's not anything .
don't feel bad .
we jump we bounce .
we .
she loves to stand up .
light .
do you think she recognizes did you play with any stuffed animals today ?
i tried to .
i showed her i showed her everything but .
she picked up the eagle and that was about it .
okay .
anything .
but i showed her everything .
anything familiar from that child ?
or home or just a name or .
nah .
no unless it's mickey mouse .
nathan's really into mickey mouse so .
of course her face lights up as soon as mickey comes on the tv .
yes .
was she into .
she liked the clock i think cause she could pick it up and it was big .
did you like this ?
it's got a face on it too .
what do you think she liked the most today ?
it seems like she loves the spaghetti .
do you like the spaghetti ?
and .
what do you think she .
liked the least ?
probably the stuffed animals .
because we at least made it through a book .
you know .
i would have to .
say the stuffed animals was the least .
you're really a toy company aren't you ?
that would be good that would be good .
i'm sure we would all get paid a little bit more .
i'm sure you would .
what working for hours and hours and hours for no money isn't fun ?
do you .
we have keys at home too .
so .
you like them .
you like them .
do you have babydolls or anything similar to .
we do have a babydoll .
that my mom got for nathan to get ready for .
but .
it's never really played with .
it has a rattle in the head so we do rattle it's head sometimes .
okay .
but .
it's just not .
not a favorite .
okay so today wasn't .
this is nothing .
abnormal .
we have more battery operated toys i guess at home too .
so .
you know there's lights and whistles and stuff .
and how does she play with block is it .
she picks em up and puts em in her mouth .
pretty much .
it's her thing right ?
that's her thing .
she's orally fixated .
and discovering the world right ?
are you orally fixated ?
was there anything else you thought .
she was really interested in or really opposed to that was .
interesting today ?
i think that she .
no .
i don't know .
i think that she liked to chew on things .
do you like to chew on things ?
that's what i think .
i think you like to chew on things .
and it really doesn't matter what it is .
exactly she's happy .
she's .
much happier than her brother .
that's good .
are you a happy baby ?
okay well then that's .
anything else ?
all .
she can play just keep playing over here .
okay .
it's hard to play with people watching .
sure is .
they get familiar .
they kind of remember the set up and the toys are the same .
a little bit overwhelmed .
overtime what they like .
what changes or the way the play with toys and how it changes it's kind of interesting .
cool .
but as far as today's visit .
what did you feel that she liked was attracted to most ?
these things i think that resemble boobs .
i guess the .
you don't think she thought it was food ?
i do not know i mean .
i don't think i've ever given her anything that looked like that .
but she likes hard plastic stuff .
at the moment .
okay .
so did she like any of the other plastic things ?
no she fixated on the .
peas and the .
pastas i guess .
hard plastic .
nice texture on the gums i guess .
now you've got this .
so she liked to put stuff in her mouth right now .
yep .
and this stuff .
so do you feel like that's the reason that she's attracted to that kind of stuff because it's ?
i think because i think these things felt good .
and she chewed on them .
but it's hard plastic .
shh she doesn't like stuffed animals .
like she doesn't play with them ever .
and i guess it's the same here .
she didn't like so she didn't like any of those .
well she liked this thing because it's it's kinda gross .
they all seem to like that .
she's not into books either at the moment .
so it's just like home .
same stuff she cares about at home that she does here .
do you have some of the same kinds of things at home that you ?
i have .
i didn't show her these books but we have the keys that she didn't care about and the measuring stuff she has and she doesn't care about and this she loves because it's a bottle .
so i didn't think she would recognize that as something that she could drink from .
does seem like she .
so that so i was going to ask you that too she may recognize that as something that she's seen before used before .
well i mean .
is there anything else you feel like she could recognize ?
either the names of or what they are ?
this thing she has but .
you know this guy .
is that winnie the pooh ?
okay so you have some stuffed animals at home but she doesn't like .
she doesn't have any play food yet i guess that's what i should get her .
does she have other plastic things at home ?
she has .
lots and lots of plastic things .
nothing that looks like this though .
or that .
like rattles and .
things designed for somebody her age .
i guess .
and does she have any dolls at home ?
she has one that's smaller than this .
and she likes to chew on it's face and she tried to chew on this one's face .
her head as well so .
i think she recognized the the babydoll .
okay .
you recognize this guy ?
same features .
somebody want to eat ?
seems like when they do like the dolls it's the face .
you sure do notice .
let's see what else i have for you .
so did she like .
you already answered that about the she liked the spaghetti .
i was going to say did she like plastic stuff all pretty much equally .
she likes plastic stuff .
okay .
so it doesn't matter what it is it was just good .
okay .
what else ?
what else ?
does she have any toys at home that she really does like that we don't have here ?
she doesn't have like a a favorite preference of toy it's just what happens whatever happens to be .
given to her is what she'll play with for a couple seconds but then she'll move on .
the things she likes right now is paper .
like i'll just give her a magazine to tear up .
and things that make noise when you shake them like that .
i just i know that she does not like anything soft .
and do you think there's a reason for that ?
probably not fun to chew on i would say .
and doesn't make noise .
the two most important things .
yep .
okay .
is there any kind of toy that you feel would be good for her personality whether you have it or not or we have it or not is there anything about her that you feel like would be good .
like what she has right now the because she waves her arms a lot .
and if it makes noise when she's waving her arms i think that's what makes her happy .
so .
she does seem happy .
and remote controls she's also very into .
they have to be real ones .
what does she do with those ?
chews .
presses .
so i went and i actually got her a real remote control .
to use and she likes it .
that wouldn't be surprising .
because we're both .
and she also likes computer keyboards .
i just things that .
react when pressed and manipulated .
so it's hard to say .
likes the response .
yep .
is let's see .
does she know the names of any animals at this point ?
well she knows .
maybe cat or kittie because we have three .
but i guess .
like what do you mean by know ?
well would she recognize that word perhaps ?
dorothy kittie ?
kittie kittie .
maybe not .
hard to say when there's so much other .
distractions .
kittie ?
kittie kittie .
kittie cat ?
you like your kittie cat ?
i think she i think she knows .
okay .
and would she recognize the names of any food ?
or drink ?
milk she knows .
but i think that's it .
alright .
did i not ask something that would be good to know about what she likes to play with or how she likes to play ?
she likes to play alone .
that's why it was hard for me to play with her because normally like she doesn't interact with me so much as she .
just does her own thing .
like she can be on her own for long periods of time .
so .
i do not know if that's helpful or not .
that's very helpful .
so she's happy playing by herself .
that's great .
very good .
well i'm going to go ahead and turn this stuff off .
okey dokey .
okay .
he can keep on playing .
so do you find .
that if he was going for anything in particular ?
yes i found that he he was really interested in the cylindrical shapes .
like these .
and really brightly colored .
like these pizza things he he was interested in this .
these are food these are things we don't have at all at home .
so it was mostly things that he had never really seen before .
he was very interested in exploring .
when i tried to show him books though .
he was like i want to see this right now .
so he kinda looked at it for a second .
two different types of books that i read .
which books did you read ?
on the farm .
and goodnight moon one two three .
and .
i we have goodnight moon and it's a very similar illustration .
to that book so he looked at it for a minute and then he went back to doing what he wanted to .
which is not really uncommon anyway but i thought it was interesting cause he wanted to try all the new things .
are there any food items that he you think like were familiar to him like things that you did have at home ?
spoon yep .
the spoon .
he has a sippy cup that looks a lot like but only a bigger version that he's just starting to learn how to use and .
and he was really interested in this when he first came .
and then he saw like he'd never seen pizza .
i mean you know not that it looks like that .
and also he was really interested in the baby doll he has a few stuffed animals but he doesn't have any dolls so i'm not sure if he's every really like played or seen with a baby doll before .
and it's almost the same size when i had him had the baby doll sitting up he was like looking right at it eye to eye so .
he seemed kinda interested in that .
he's really rollie pollie right now .
he likes to roll around .
he's getting ready to being mobile soon .
have does he still just get milk or does he ever get juice or ?
no juice .
he gets formula and breast milk and he started on solids two months ago .
does he know any of his like animal sounds yet ?
he has this little dogs .
yes because we have two dogs but he has he has this little baby einstein like thing that makes animal noises .
i'm not sure if he could actually equate those with .
the animal on the .
farm but but they make like .
he's so cute .
thank you .
did he go for any of any of the stuffed animals it doesn't look like it ?
no he has he has a few stuffed animals and things like that .
he really was not interested in them interestingly i've like tried to get him to play with a few of them and he'd look at it and kinda smile and then go back to all the colorful things .
he liked the ice cream cones a lot too .
and these little .
spaghetti type ones .
pasta .
he seemed to like the round shapes too like he'd go for a lot i guess a lot of these are round shapes .
he went for the bread a couple times too .
i wonder if he's actually like sorting them by .
by shape or color .
he was just picking up stuff and then .
putting them back down .
would he know what some of these things are like peanut butter and ?
not yet he'd know peas but they don't look like this cause his peas are still really they're pureed peas .
but peas are his favorite food .
nope no no .
victor no no .
we don't needta do that .
did he ever play with the clock at all ?
he did when he i showed it to him he kinda just looked at it and then when he was when he like kinda fell over and then rolled back onto his stomach to play and then he was interested in it .
and what kind of things did he do with the the baby doll like ?
he just smiled at it .
he didn't and kinda reached for it but he didn't really .
did you do anything with the clothing or anything like that ?
the sock the shoe .
he played with the shoe .
was separate .
the little pink shoe and then i put the shoe on him and showed him that baby's shoe .
victor's shoe but i don't know if he really got the correlation yet .
yes .
let's see .
does he see plates at all at home ?
he does he was interested in the plates too .
he's feed out of little bowls but but we have plates at home .
so .
i heard you talking about pears do you do you make them ?
yes .
yep he eats pears all the time but he doesn't usually see them whole like this though .
maybe i'll introduce them to him and he was also very interested in the pear as well .
no no .
let us see .
let us see .
has he ever been to the zoo before .
has he ever seen it ?
no .
the zoo animals ?
not yet .
farm animals ?
not yet .
we have no .
not yet unfortunately .
we were going to go to the petting zoo and then we got rained out so .
you gotta see the cows .
we've seen he's seen them like .
driving by but not like up close .
do you live in a rural area ?
my parents do .
okay .
and horses .
he's seen horses before .
so what kinda things .
what kinda does she do they have on the farm ?
in the farm area ?
they have cows and horses .
cows and horses okay .
and then he sees all different types of dogs which really interest him cause like especially when they bark .
i like gods too .
you like the doggie ?
does that taste good ?
okay well i think that's pretty much it .
okay .
that's all we got .
you can keep playing .
you like the spoons i can tell .
well she was interested in these plates .
at first .
i guess i don't know why the color or the shape maybe .
but then once she had the spoons that's about it .
she really didn't you know if i if i showed her something she'd be distracted for a second .
but she really i guess likes these the noise they make or something .
i guess she likes things that make noise .
does she play with anything else that makes noise ?
she had the keys for a little bit and was shaking them .
but when she discovered the spoon she seemed to like them best of all .
and you think its just because of the noise probably ?
well she she seemed to have liked to grab the big one .
i think it was easy to hold she would and she would just shake it around .
i think she liked .
shaking it around .
she she would drop them and she would you know she'd have the big one and then she'd switch to having all the little ones .
and then switch back to having the big one .
it was interesting .
we don't play with measuring spoons at home maybe we'll have to get you some ?
i was going to ask you if she played with anything similar to these ?
well we have measuring spoons when ?
she cooks with when we cook in the kitchen .
we'll give her like a spoon or a cup we don't give her you know all of them together so .
no .
do you think she would recognize something like that do the single ones you give her are they anything like these ?
are you talking about just like a regular spoon ?
no we give her measure she had a measuring spoon and a measuring cup the other day .
so she might recognize them .
i mean they're white .
they're similar shape .
but we've never given her like a group of them connected .
they could also be similar to like you know keys that she tries to take from us that i don't let her have .
like car keys and stuff .
okay so she's seen keys .
but she didn't want these she wanted these .
you like those .
did she play with any of the other food or .
she she picked up a plate she pi she was rolling this around for a little bit .
trying to .
and she picked up this as well for a little bit .
and the cheese for a little bit .
bef she's and then just a second ago she had the slice of pizza .
she's just i noticed she likes she tends to like to pick up flatt flatter things .
i think they're easier for her to hold .
when she tried to pick this up she had more of a problem with it .
did she show any interest in any of the books ?
i tried to show her a book and she pushed it away .
she was like i want to play with the keys .
stop distracting me .
no books this time .
no book this time .
how about any of those stuffed animals ?
no i tried to attract her attention with the frog .
and the dog and even the puppet .
moving it around and having it talk to her kiss her and she would look at it but then she went straight back to the key the the measuring spoons .
and how about the baby doll ?
she smiled at it and l but she didn't really she wanted to play with the spoons .
but she looked at it .
she did she looked at it she smiled at it .
she even made like a little noise but then she went back to spoons .
so out of all these things obviously the measuring spoons were the favorite what about the n if those weren't there what would you say would guess would be the most interesting for her based on her personality or what you see at home ?
anything that can she make make noise .
she likes to shake things like rattles and and things like that .
but if it wasn't the measuring spoons she probably would have played with the keys more .
if both of those were gone i would imagine she would have well when i first set her down in the middle she went straight for the pile of of food .
probably would have just spent her time picking those up and banging them together and and picking up different ones passing them back and forth between her hands .
does she bang other things together at home ?
yes .
we don't have blocks here sometimes moms will stack these does she have any blocks at home ?
no she doesn't not yet .
that's hard to pick up .
she just can't seem to get that very well yet .
we read stories before her nap and bedtime so you know after playtime's done .
i don't have the books out i guess at the same time as her toys .
and then does she have any favorites that you look at at home ?
she likes the the ones that she can touch .
that's i bought this out at first but she wasn't interested .
she likes to be able to touch the feely books while we read them .
okay let's see what would you say interested her the very least ?
today ?
the books .
she wasn't interested in having me read to her she wanted to play .
okay and at home do you think she prefers books or toys ?
probably toys .
i mean she we have like a set story time .
story times during the day before each of her naps and at bedtime we'll read to her three books .
but she's kinda settled down .
but she smiles like when i you know get her changed and everything in her jammies and we'll get the books she'll smile at them .
so she likes to hear the stories she likes to likes to look at the pictures .
i guess it's part of the routine .
right right and she enjoys that .
okay does she have any dolls at home ?
she has one doll we just got it for her like two days ago a baby a little squishy baby doll .
okay and how about any stuffed animals at home ?
we do have some but she really doesn't play with them a lot because she mostly wants to chew on them and they get all gross .
right that's understandable .
we don't have play food at home .
okay .
not yet .
not yet .
not yet i think that might be all the questions .
and i guess do you think there are any of the items here that you think that she would recognize the names of at this point ?
maybe baby .
maybe book .
that's probably maybe keys that's probably about it .
okay that's great that's all i needta ask .
and so he can just keep playing .
okay .
did you notice that he was interested in any .
set of toys ?
the food toys which is making me wonder if he's hungry .
the peas .
the .
mostly the food toys .
the peas the pizza the waffle .
the .
the waffle .
the pasta .
keys for a little while .
and the stuffed animals seemed to hold him from the beginning but not .
they didn't seem to to sustain him .
okay .
the food was mostly .
seems to be his primary interest .
okay do you do you guys have play food ?
we don't .
which is kind of interesting .
okay .
usually food is is food and and when he sees it it's not necessarily in this form .
unless well he's sees it on my husband's plate or my plate .
like he'll see pizza pieces or or .
pasta .
right .
or peas .
you know it's kind of what we eat so .
okay .
which is which i kind of thought was interesting .
and this thing .
it's weird looking .
with the crazy hair so .
i thought he would be more interested in pooh because we have a pooh at home it looks a little like this but .
guess he's .
over pooh .
we read books .
the only one that was good night moon .
but we read .
he didn't seemta to to go for the books today .
okay .
i didn't think .
alright .
and the lid to the bumbo .
alright .
there's .
always the lid to the bumbo .
do you think he'd recognize any of the animals in there ?
not really .
not really i don't think so no .
s we have a dog at home .
and he didn't seem to .
gravitate towards any of those so particularly no .
okay .
so would you say he likes books or toys right now ?
i'm thinking he's more of a toy person at this stage .
right .
i read to him but he's you know .
but th i think he see that as i'm about to go to bed .
so i i probably needta to f adjust that a little bit so .
like someone's trying to give me to go to sleep .
do you have dolls at home or anything ?
we've got like stuffed things like this like there's a pooh his his vibrates .
you know that kind of thing .
we have stuffed animals but he doesn't really play with them they're more of decoration for the for the room .
it's not really he'll grab at it an but he doesn't necessarily .
play with them ?
play with them per se .
he plays with .
okay !
he plays with little helicopters or .
or or little like happy meal food .
those ki of happy meal food toys .
those kinds of those kinds of toys .
sweet pea .
shh .
we're almost done .
he's i don't want to keep him here .
he'll be alright .
well he does usually play .
and he plays with his niece .
and as long as she's on the floor with him .
he tends to play a little bit longer than he does .
when he's alone or when he's you know when he doesn't when he doesn't have her .
okay .
so s .
sweetie pie .
so not really .
he's starting to get sleepy .
not really a si not really a sibling .
but since they spend so much time together .
she's she'll be two in august .
okay .
august seventeenth .
so that's the one thing about them play about playing .
and i mean it's just you know it's like helicopters and .
i call them happy happy meal toys .
but not really so much .
he doesn't really seem to gravitate much to dolls .
they don't they don't do anything really .
right .
they just sit there .
but he's got .
like a little s .
a push truck that plays music .
and he he seems to like those .
so so jingle balls and and those you know those those things that make a noise so any .
right .
i think he gets in direct keys .
okay .
so .
and he likes things that aren't toys .
anything that's not a toy it's th that's where we want to go .
like mommy's makeup counter and c .
facial cleanser and .
wires .
wires the wires .
those are always fun .
but that's you know .
that's it ?
okay i think we are finished .
this is colin powell ?
right ?
today is july twenty fourth and this is visit one .
woah !
okay .
i just have a few questions for you .
i just need a tissue real quick .
sure !
okay .
thanks .
you like those keys baby ?
thanks !
you want this key don't you ?
okay !
so which of these toys seemed to interest him the most ?
he likes .
the cup .
and the plate .
and the keys the most .
okay .
and why why do you think that is ?
cause .
we've been practicing drinking from a cup .
when i'm cooking or something at home .
trying to keep him busy .
i give him like a spoon or .
some kitchen .
plastic utensil to play with .
something different to keep him .
you know engaged .
and then keys .
i think just because they make a noise and he .
he's into like shaking right now .
okay .
which of the toys seem to interest him the least ?
i think .
the books .
it's okay .
and why you think that is ?
maybe cause they're hard and he likes .
like textures .
like grabbing and being able to .
pick up stuff easily right now .
okay .
and .
so i tried to show him a book .
but he didn't .
he liked the other stuff that he can hold .
ha .
woah !
do you look at book at home ?
at all or ?
yes we do .
is there any .
like it does he have a favorite book or ?
not really .
he doesn't really .
pay too much attention .
i know he's listening when i'm reading .
cause .
i read to him and his sister together .
so i know he's listening .
but he's not really .
in into like looking at it or .
touching the book yet .
okay .
so it could also be maybe .
he sees enough at home like .
you know he wants a new toy .
i do not know .
do you think he recognizes the names of any of these ?
i think so .
like .
spoons and the cup and plate .
and the dog .
we have a dog .
okay .
what about some of the food ?
the food .
probably not he just started eating .
okay .
and there's nothing that he's eaten .
okay .
in here so .
i don't think so ha .
okay .
do you have any of these toys at home ?
we do we have books .
we have stuffed animals .
dogs .
cups .
spoons .
so .
and does does do you ever play with pretend food ?
does his sister have any pretend food that ?
you guys play with ?
what's ?
we play with .
not pretend food .
really it's more like we pretend we have it in our hand like .
but it's not any of this play stuff .
okay .
so we like .
you want to strawberry ?
and i give him one .
and just like that .
okay .
but not anything to actually hold .
okay .
he seemed interested in the icecream and the .
he he did .
cause he's never .
he's never had it haha .
okay .
that i don't think he's seen .
us or his sister .
eat icecream .
so .
okay .
maybe just the shape .
i guess these two .
the peas .
okay .
does he play with dolls ?
dolls at home ?
his sister has lots of dolls so .
he has .
he gets to play with dolls .
okay .
i think .
that's all we have .
for you today .
you did really good !
you did .
you're hungry ?
haha .
you need some real food ?
right ?
haha .
okay .
what first ?
man .
i guess some of the food .
the spoons we played with first .
and then i guess we read a little bit of the goodnight moon book .
and the she picked some more of the food .
mostly she seemed to like the icecream cone .
what did you play with after that ?
after the icecream cone .
i guess we started playing i gave her some other things .
you liked that too .
she had the spoon then she came over here .
and she was playing a little bit like the plate and the spoon over here .
i read her that book earlier too .
and then .
what like reading ?
or .
this ?
which thing .
the book .
we have like there's it's * d not this one .
but she has like three other ones that are kinda similar so i read those to her .
i just do peek a boo and stuff like that .
and then .
what else did we do lexie ?
then she was rolling around a little bit .
did you eat any other food over there ?
she played with the measuring spoons .
and played with the clock a little bit .
and i guess that's about it .
she looked at mister brown can can you .
which is something we read with her brother but .
you eating your fingers silly girl ?
there was one other food i saw that she was interested in .
the breakfast food .
the waffle ?
i forgot that .
so do you have pretend food at home ?
you know what ?
we have a little bit but she doesn't have it .
she doesn't have it its in the basement .
and she normally doesn't go down there .
just because we only have like one chicken drumstick and that's it .
so .
maybe we should get you some fake food .
what was she not interested in ?
she didn't really seem very interested in the stuffed animals .
except for the frog .
but she didn't really go for that and she didn't seem interested in the doll .
does she have a doll at home ?
she actually does but her doll is more a stuffed animal than a doll .
it's a stuffed animal that looks like a doll .
so .
it's soft and everything .
what other books that were here did you own ?
we have the foot book .
we have versions of this .
we have good night moon .
not the one two three but we've got the .
we have books that are sort of like this that are you know tactile .
or whatever you would call it .
we don't have that one .
but we have lots of books i mean i read to her everyday .
so .
you okay ?
are you okay ?
we're all done thank you so much .
okay great !
thank you .
alright lexie .
enjoy your day .
say bye bye toys we'll see you .
alright .
so basically i wanted to ask what you thought she enjoyed the most out of the toys here .
i was looking at that because i figured you were going to ask me that and the t som the the toys that resemble food .
she kept migrating towards the cookie .
and the pizza .
and the icecream cone .
and those things she kept .
like this one she she wouldn't want to didn't want to put this down .
until she picked up something else and then she kept going back to that one .
and so she i think she really .
but we like coldstone creamery .
so we go and take her sister to get icecream and she likes icecream so maybe that is why she's migrating towards the icecream cone .
but i noticed the pizza and the cookie .
and but anything else i was trying to force it on her and the spaghetti too .
she was messing with the spaghetti .
the one that .
she had one over here that looked a little bit more like spaghetti .
but the ones that have the food .
here we go .
she wouldn't put these down .
this one because of the the weird texture of this .
which she loves keys .
i think all babies do .
but this one it moved on its own and it caught her eye .
and she was like ".
i don't think i like that .
and so then i moved it over here and she kept staring at it .
and then she was like ".
okay i want to touch it but i don't want to touch it .
so it was unknown to her and then like i would i would push it towards her and she showed fear .
by moving away from it so i thought that was funny .
and it was funny .
because we have a kooshball .
i do not know if you know what those are they're but they're they're not as as .
right and so they move a little bit more freely too because they don't stick .
and .
her sister is terrified of it .
she won't touch it she won't pick up and i played an awful trick and threw it at her .
and she laughed and picked it up .
and she wasn't afraid of the kooshball .
but this i think because of the texture .
not so much the color but the texture .
she's drawn to it .
well that's what i was going to ask you next is why you thought she liked the certain things that she did like .
some mothers think it's color or texture .
and it's interesting that you observed what happened when she saw that move by itself .
because even still now they're like letting go of the the tentacles are letting go of each other .
and you can't control that so when it's sitting there and it does it it's like ".
wait a minute why did that move i want to touch that .
how about these other stuffed animals ?
i just trying to get her to touch the stuffed animals and she'd look at it but okay .
p pooh her nanna loves pooh so she's she looked at it a little bit but .
so maybe because it was more familiar to her but the other stuffed animals no .
she liked this one .
she she put this one in her mouth i think it was because of the stripes .
the striped hat .
and the duck you know i go to give her a kiss and .
nothing .
but the baby .
she did like the baby .
and she was looked like she was trying to hug the baby .
and i don't know if it was coincidence or not but she had the bottle in her hand .
and .
so when i gave her the baby she put the baby down picked up the bottle .
put the bottle down .
it looked like she was trying to coordinate her hands to to do whatever she wanted to do with the baby and the bottle .
i don't think it was to feed it but i think she might associate the bottle with .
now she's mainly breastfed and it's i stay at home with her now i'm not i'm you know i took a year off from teaching to be with her .
and so it's very rare that she hasta be bottle-fed unless i have you know something i have to do when she's with my mother .
or her her n my mother in law .
so they'll occasionally use a bottle but she's skipping straight to the bottle and going to the cup .
but she didn't want to play with this one .
do you think she would recognize that as something familiar ?
well she should've because but maybe n maybe not with the top because she's she's busy she doesn't want the top she wants .
like you pick up a cup and she goes .
i don't want the bottle .
i don't want anything .
i want your cup .
i want what you have in your cup .
so she's not but she put this in her mouth .
she did definitely knew what this was so .
that looked familiar .
and some of the food you think may look familiar too ?
well w ca h her dad and sister had pizza the other night .
i do cook spaghetti .
so i'm not sure if .
it's because it's familiar .
but she definitely keeps putting the food .
nothing else really she was putting in her mouth .
she didn't put the stuffed animals in her mouth .
well she puts the keys in her mouth because that's what she does for everything all her play keys but .
like nothing else you know most of the time when she's trying to figure something out she puts it in her mouth .
but mainly if it was a food toy she put the food and the toy in her mouth .
she didn't put the .
well she tried to eat the baby .
and she keeps going to .
and i think because the baby looks like her .
you know ?
i'm trying to get to know the baby .
and was she interested in the books at all ?
no .
no books .
no even though we i read with her sister everyday you kn .
mommy can you read this to me ?
i want to read to .
and we you know doing word recognition with her her sister .
but she's not showing interest yet .
i i picked this one up and .
nothing .
she wasn't really interested in it .
i think she looked at it i think because of the colors .
maybe the face on it but .
but nothing else .
she did i was when i said i i recognized i'd answered incorrectly .
i'm not sure if i did or not but she actually picked the two up and was able to tap she tapped them together .
and i'm not sure if i answered that correctly on the que on the .
als i'll look for it .
if she's able to tap them together .
and .
and then as far as the names of some of these things like the food .
would do you think she would recognize names ?
maybe maybe not .
but i do you a you know whatever i do i always verbalize what i'm doing ".
i'm getting you a cup now .
you know i want her to develop lang her sis sister developed speaking very early and .
has none stop despite i think shh i think she has a stutter .
i'm not sure .
it's because all kids do it at this age .
trying their brain is working trying to figure out what they want to say .
but with her i'm probably more sensitive to it because her father has a stutter .
and so i .
you know i'm just probably more on edge about it because .
just give her some time .
when we have a very good friend who's a speech therapist .
and he said don't worry about it until she's four .
if she's still doing that and getting hung up on her like her and her her then address it .
but for now don't even worry about it and she has a lisp .
but it's just with you know like snake .
she's young .
and she is young and when i say micah say and she'll do it .
she can do it .
it's just a matter of her being in such a hurry .
right and she's probably used to do doing it the other way .
so i'm not g i'm not worried about it .
but if qwynn does the same thing you can't .
i think stuttering hasta be hereditary .
well they know now that's at least a component of it .
it hasta be .
because what are the odds .
i just read in the paper about they identified some genes that are related to stuttering .
really ?
still looking for some more but but there are some genes that contribute to stuttering .
so we know that at least that's one factor .
and maybe it takes more than that to to really cause a person to stutter .
i don't know my husband had a blood clot when he was a a baby .
and they actually sent him home to .
told his mom to make his arrangements .
for burial because he wasn't going to make it .
and one of the most intellectual people i know today .
you can't tell me that he was supposed to die .
you know ?
but that's just .
and he and she says that that's where they say that's where the stuttering came from .
and i don't think so .
i think if you're tw .
because it happened to him when he was eighteen months or two years old something like that .
but if you're that young you haven't even developed the speech yet .
so how do you know ?
you know ?
you you can say and .
which you know ?
but how do you know that you weren't going to stutter before the blood clot ?
you don't know and so i'm just i just listen .
i file it away .
it's one one battle i'm not going to fight .
but i know as a mother you know and and as a teacher .
because i teach sixth sixth grade and i taught fifth for several years and i've come across my fair share of stuttering students .
and it does not have to hinder their cognitive abilities or their learning or you know their even their participation in class .
i just you know it doesn't have to be that way .
as long as they feel they don't feel ashamed .
it shouldn't be any .
but i think that if if it comes down to it she's definitely in the right place you know with you all i think .
she is .
and i put that on there so if you all come across any studies for micah's age group that would be great too .
you know just give us a call .
we'll gladly bring her in .
and if you do become concerned about like when she's four .
you you have your friend so that's a resource .
and if you ever wanted to get her evaluated here at the clinic they do that here too .
so you can just make an appointment and have her evaluated .
we actually have on the faculty here one of the i mean most well known people who work with stutterers .
okay .
and so she would be part of that evaluation .
that would be good to know .
that's good to know .
she's great they have two fluency groups that meet here that are adults stutterers .
so there's a pretty strong .
actually our department chair too is her background is in fluency too .
so so that's a very strong piece of the department here .
so but she your daughter's young and but if you ever did want to have her evaluated that you could come here .
i will i'll keep that in mind .
use your friend .
well charles is excellent .
he he works with howard at howard university too so he's .
so there they probably have .
they're not as extensive as maryland i would imagine but .
so you have you know what to do .
definitely .
now as far as qwynn we have a lot of .
hi !
we have a lot of information that you provided and we're going to ask you ea at each visit to fill out .
and i know that a lot of it is going to be the same but she will change over time so you'll see that .
she'll grow and develop .
each time we have a play session it's going to be these toys so we'll see if .
if her interests change .
if her interests change if the way she explains the toys change .
anything like that so it'll be just like this .
okay .
and .
and it's over the course of four visits so that means she'll be .
she'll be .
this is the seven month visit then we'll do around ten months around eleven months and then at two years .
and the two year visit is a little different .
there will be a play session but they'll be some some evaluations and assessments and then we'll be able to give you some information on her that way when she's two .
that'll be fun .
it is and to see the the change and the progression .
alright well we are all done and i can take your microphone .
okay .
seemed to interest him the most ?
do you think ?
i think he was a fan of the peas .
and the keys .
haha the peas and the keys !
and why do you think .
and actually the the plush toys too .
i'm surprised that he wasn't interested in the books .
because at home he loves his books .
really ?
why .
but he has he has specific .
i'm sorry what were you going to ask ?
no i was just going to ask like why do you think he was more like interested in those .
i don't know .
i mean clearly the keys he's interested in because he can chew on them .
and he's teething .
so anything he can chew on right now .
and they make noise .
when he shakes them .
not really sure about the peas .
that's my guess .
and he also was going after the plush things more than he does at home .
because he has lots of stuffed animals that he generally ignores and goes more for the books at home .
so who knows .
do you think probably because these stuffed animals are like new to him maybe ?
they might be .
and those are the ones that he always that we read over and over .
because the none of these were .
i actually thought he'd love this one because we have where is baby's belly button .
but maybe since these were different they weren't he wasn't as drawn to them ?
okay .
but these being different were apparently interesting to him so .
out of all the stuffed animals which one do you think he .
had most interest with ?
what was the first one ?
that chicken .
where is it ?
here .
haha is this a funny chicken ?
don't gag yourself mister .
so out of all the toys which one would you say he liked the least ?
the least ?
all the toys that are here ?
or all the toys that he played with ?
all the toys that are here ?
because i mean some of them he didn't even look at .
he was re he seemed really indifferent to the baby doll .
haha .
what did you like the least jack ?
do you feel like he played with a lot of the foods ?
i was going to say the food stuff he wasn't that interested in .
i mean with the exception of the peas .
the food probably the food stuff in general he was least interested in .
do you think if you said any of the names of the items would he recognize them ?
not at this point .
i don't think so no .
i mean .
if you said like peas would he know that's peas ?
cookies is cookies ?
the only thing he would probably know is if there was .
well i actually just noticed this .
like he might recognize this because he does he has a cup .
that he drinks water from .
but i would be .
no i don't think he would recognize the names of the other foods .
okay and do you have any toys like this at home other than like just the stuffed animals and books ?
stuffed animals and books .
we don't have any of this kind of food stuff no .
okay and you were reading that book to him .
wh do you see if there were any items that really interest him in that one ?
in this one ?
i mean it's the flaps .
the flaps ?
like which flaps did he like ?
i think he liked the ones that were .
like he liked the umbrella .
and he liked the he had trouble with .
the curtains .
he liked this one the ball .
he's a big fan of balls .
that's why i was trying to make this into a .
ball type object .
because he seems to really .
be a fan of balls lately .
i would say the ball in here and the umbrella .
okay .
were the two that he were the two flaps he liked .
okay would you overall say that he's interested in books or toys ?
i'd say that he has a runny nose .
here or at home ?
here .
here .
toys .
toys .
and at home you would say books ?
well .
it's hard to tell ?
i would say it's probably much more equal at home .
okay okay .
and have you ever played pretend food at home ?
we haven't .
you haven't ?
you like to watch mommy and daddy cook .
with real food .
and we explain real food to you .
but we don't have plastic food .
so do you think he'll recognize any of the foods at home ?
outside of dog food ?
haha .
probably not yet at this point .
i mean he he watches us .
and he's very interested in what we're doing .
but i don't know that there's recognition yet between you know .
milk .
and .
flour .
and .
chicken and that kind of stuff .
okay and i'm assuming he probably doesn't play with any dolls at home ?
well i'm not gender i mean we don't we don't have any just because he's the first .
but i will say that we were at friend's house a few weeks ago .
and she has a son and a daughter .
and they got lots of trucks and lots of dolls .
and we don't have either .
we don't t we don't have trucks for him yet or dolls .
and he was very interested in the trucks so .
haha .
okay well that's good .
we have st lots of stuffed animals .
but we don't have baby dolls yet do we ?
no we don't .
okay and that is it .
you love .
you love these keys !
reach them ?
you can stop now .
he can keep playing if he wants .
okay .
while we we chat .
sure .
he got kinda ang he gets really angry when i take things away from him .
that's okay .
that we really wants like paper and .
the remote control .
okay .
so which toys do you think he was most interested in ?
toys that make sounds .
and toys that he could put in his mouth .
okay why do you think that he likes those ?
because he's pretty active and he likes to clang things around .
so shake his arm and throw things .
so that's just been my observation that's what he gravitates to normally .
an that and things that he isn't allowed to have .
okay which ones do you think he was least interested in ?
he wasn't really interested in what i was doing with the food .
did you look at any of the books we had ?
which ones ?
we were reading mister brown can can you .
and do you have any of these at home ?
we have that one at home .
we haven't looked at it in a few months though .
i think i don't actually know where it is right now .
do you think in general he prefers books or toys ?
i think it depends .
he likes to play with the books .
like when we try to we try to read him books every night as part of our going to bed routine .
and he always is trying to grab them and play with them instead of reading for the most part .
so i guess it just .
he kind of alternates between playing with the toys .
like if we were at home and he had the option he would kind of take one and then the other .
it's not like i think he exclusively prefers one or the other .
do you have a babydoll at home or ?
no not we have more stuffed animals .
we don't have a babydoll like that .
so that's kind of the first time i think he's seen a doll like that .
and do you think he would recognize the names of any of these items ?
books .
book definitely .
i don't know .
probably not anything else actually .
sippycup maybe .
we've just started using that .
recently .
so maybe book and sippycup .
and any of the animals ?
maybe bumblebee .
maybe winnie the pooh .
maybe the rooster .
okay .
do you have similar toys at home or do you have ?
we don't really have .
i don't the stuffed animals that we have he doesn't play like i don't generally give to him to play with .
we don't have any of the food .
we have little rattles and things .
we have the books .
that's about it .
are there other toys at home that he likes to play with that we don't have here ?
he likes he likes things that have crinkly cellophane in them .
he has some like teething toys that are like stuffed with plastic parts and things .
and he has little trucks that he like fisher price dump truck kinda thing that he likes .
and there's a toy called a whoozit .
which has like it's black and white on one side and the other side has a little face on it .
you're just into it aren't you ?
is there anything else you think we should know about his play skills things we didn't see here or is this typical of how he plays ?
it typi like he likes to he likes shaking things that make noise he likes .
doing that when he's really excited .
okay .
is there anything else that you think we should know ?
i don't think so .
alright .
well we're all done then .
you sure ?
okay .
but i do want to talk to you a few minutes about it .
sure sure .
you want to come out for that ?
she's .
okay okay you're out .
don't worry .
i think .
there we go okay .
okay hold on .
there there you're okay .
isabel .
my goodness .
there shh shh .
want to crawl around ?
you're okay .
there .
there .
there .
okay .
there .
that was a pretty quick turn around .
get a distraction in there .
so are any of these toys ones that you actually have at home ?
that she's particulary familiar with already or ?
the food .
you want in particular ?
in general .
like the peas .
we have these the same exact peas at home .
some of the plates .
i do not know if she'll go after those .
i take it they're for her sister .
the spoons .
she has an older sister .
and then she has some stuffed animals .
although she has lots of stuffed animals .
i don't think she's ever played with a baby doll before .
and then .
you know we read her books .
but nothing .
isabel not in your mouth .
but not .
we clean them after each baby so .
okay well that's not too bad then .
i don't think we have these exact books .
but .
you commented that good night moon was the new one so i was thinking .
the numbers .
i haven't seen the number good night moon before .
we have the original .
does she actually play with the food items ?
or is it mostly just that her sister does and they're in the house ?
no she'll play with them .
but she just kind of handles them .
and looks at them and .
goes on to the next .
are there particular toys that you think match her personality better ?
that she tends to go for or tends to be more interested in as a general class ?
ones that light up and play music .
seem to be those seem to get her attention the most .
or anything she can put in her mouth .
that's pretty typical .
but .
why did you pick the particular stuffed animals that you did out of all of them ?
cause you di you were choosing among them .
the brighter colored ones .
i just thought they would you know especially with the hair .
here with the different material .
that would get her attention a little more .
but definitely the brighter colors .
but you picked the chicken .
the chicken .
well then i started going with the animal sounds .
thinking that she might enjoy or .
it's harder to really teach her anything at this point but .
get them started early .
with the animal sounds .
are there particular games you tend to play with her ?
peekaboo .
this is one of them .
that's pretty much i think that's the only game i can think of that we play with her .
and we tickle her .
but i think probably peekaboo is the only that she can really .
identify with .
okay .
or no the clock actually .
she didn't have any interest in the clock .
you mentioned frio is frio a ?
it's my parent's poodle .
she sees frio probably a few times a week .
but .
it's a black poodle .
does it have the the french ?
yes yes .
but i don i she probably couldn't identify with that .
in general does she tend to prefer books or toys ?
toys .
i'd say toys for sure .
i mean with books she'll just eat she wants to put them in her mouth .
so .
and what's is there a favorite book that you actually tend to read her a lot of the ones at home ?
or is it just whatever ?
no it's probably whatever we're reading to her sister .
is what she's going to to be listening to .
maybe a little more advanced .
if only that was real .
yes .
if only .
anything in particular that you think i should be asking and i'm not ?
about what things she likes and what things she doesn't .
or anything else you can tell me .
about like .
playing habits ?
yes just playing habits .
i think you know having an older sister really gears her .
you know her sister gears her more towards what they're going to be playing with .
you know she'll pick up isabel and put her in front of the kitchen .
or put her in front of her stuffed animals .
and just start showing her things .
so i think that's .
that's probably that probably gears her more .
for her playing habits .
and .
i don't know we ha we haven't done i mean this is this is pretty .
typical just like kinda putting her in front of a bunch of toys and kinda letting her have at it .
and everything goes in her mouth .
at this age that is very difficult .
everything goes in .
she has a piano at home .
like a little kid little baby piano that she loves to bang on .
and then her seems the other toys that she likes are the bouncy seat .
she can jump up and down in that .
and anything that lights up and plays music .
and she also likes to stand .
like we have a little play table .
that she can .
that she can stand on .
or stand and hold on to .
to keep her balance .
she really likes to do that .
but .
she doesn't there's nothing else .
other than that .
that's pretty much all of her her playing habits .
okay .
well that's all i have for you .
okay .
when she gets a little older we're going to come back and do this again .
right .
at which point one of the questions will be things like what has changed .
okay .
like if she suddenly got some more interests or if she started liking different toys .
right .
hopefully .
but .
at some point she'll be moving around a little more .
there's not necessarily any right answer like some kids tend to be more into st like some kids are just really into stuffed animals .
and some kids are like well all i care about is things i can put in my mouth and some kids are .
right .
yes .
yep .
so .
here's .
let me take that from you .
here you go .
let'let us go back here , cranky girl who didn't have a nap .

what've we got here ?
some orange .

it'it would be nice if the egg was a little bit runny .
is that good ?
mmm .
i think you'll like the orange .
what's he having, bread ?
he's got .
a nibbly finger .
which he seems to really like, but he doesn't want to eat the orange .
packaged food is better ?
at least he's eating .
num ?
this is too .
this is really nice, but it would be too hot for him .
i don't think it's too hot for him but it's like .
he'll get it on his hands and rub it in his eyes and that would be a disaster .
it's slightly over cooked but .
it's a nice idea .
it'it would be good with yoghurt .
you've got that whole bit in your mouth .
the whole bit's in his mouth .
that's a lot .

did you mean to do that ?
he's trying it .

they'll all go to waste .
don't put it in .

and gran's sure you've got another tooth coming through .
i know she said she could she thought she could feel a corner but then she couldn't get her hand in enough but she thought she felt it to check but .
when he's sort of rolling around on the floor it's quite easy to look into his mouth and i couldn't see anything but .
he spat it out .

just because you've got a shoe madam .
jennifer ?
come on then .
peekaboo !
come to auntie isabelle .
ooh .
are you coming ?

every key seems to do something different to facetime, it's quite impressive .
okay .
way to make a computer complicated .
well done apple .
not the best .
are you fascinated by your shoe, are you ?
well she's grown out of them this week .
i'm really quite gutted .
has she ?
is that why your mum couldn't get her back on to ?
her foot doesn't fit in it .
funny enough the other foot fit in it .
bit of an issue .
because the other one, the other foot still had it on .
well i think maybe she's got maybe she's got odd sizes feet, i don't know .
but i took her to, i took her .
i don't know .
we were in john lewis and they had like little booties for twelve to eighteen months and i couldn't get her foot into them .
right .
i was like that's not .
that's a bit of an issue .
not useful .
jennifer's got a long body and massive feet .

she gets quite confused at the erh, the little, the man reading the news doesn't like smile back at her when she smiles and waves at him .
gran and grandad smile and wave back .
auntie isabelle smiles and waves back .
auntie isabelle does the same .
what are you doing ?
but hugh edwards on news doesn't .
appalling .
appalling behavior .
maybe next time .
maybe john mckay from s t v will be a bit more, erh, you know .
useful .
is that your laces ?
that's the laces on your shoes jennifer .
that's your laces .
mummy really was a big fan of these booties .
they are lovely .
have to see if we can find something similar .
can you say ?
jennifer jennifer ?
what size are they ?
she's just not interested, is she ?
in anything but the shoe, no .
sorry ?
in anything but the shoe, no .
the shoe she's massively interested .
mine mummy, stop playing with it .
you're not allowed to play with it .
jennifer's, .
arr how long till it goes in your mouth ?
quite a while apparently .
today's the first day she's ever pulled a a toy off a shelf .
okay .
in a shop .
she passed it straight to me .
it was a .
what was the top ?
it was like a stacking tower of little .
rings .
rings that are all different shapes and textures .
okay .
but it's she was just like she was i was holding her and she just went ooh, grabbed out for it grabbed it and then passed it to me .
but she held it for a bit and then passed it to me .
which is quite interesting .
well she was trying to play with it which obviously she was struggling with .
because it was all wrapped up .
it was wrapped up wasn't it jennifer ?
ooh, that's a shoe, thanks for that .
that's the lace you've gotta worry about .
ow i know, ow .
what you doing ?
i don't .
the lace is acting like a whip .
we don't want that .
jennifer ?
what you doing ?
now she facing !
she's getting bored of us .
don't pretend you don't know !
you're just a wee monkey aren't you ?
pick on someone your own size .
please .
little gorgeous .
are you going to say hello to auntie isabelle ?
hung .
there you go .
bye .
shoe in the mouth .
be beh .
beh beh .
heh heh .
heh heh .
is that so ?
can we try and swap it for a toy ?
can we try and swap it for a toy ?
i can see the rice rattle or even the other rattle, it's just there .
what's that ?
ga .
is that better ?
are you making noises ?
best present ever that she's got .
a bottle with some rice in it .
who put that together for her ?
i did but .
it was it she was playing with erh one of my friend's baby's version of this and erh she nearly she tried to steal it so i came home and made her one .
she a fan, it's the fact the other hand goes with it .
when she's shaking it with one hand the other hand goes too .
isn't it madam ?
so lots of boxes and noisy things like that for christmas then is it ?
not sure about that .
auntie isabelle was saying that she was going to buy a xylophone and a drum and a tambourine .
then she .
it's because she hates us .
well obviously .
or you you obviously did terrible things as a child .
jennifer ?
can you say hello to auntie isabelle ?
can you say hello ?
hello .
hello .
bubleh .
no .
not even close .
it's much more close to bye bye .
jennifer ?
can yo say bye bye .
what you doing ?
can you say ?
are you going to give me a tune ?
can you say bye bye jennifer ?
what are you going to say ?
you going to sing ?
bye bye .
what can you you can sing to auntie isabelle can't you ?
what can you sing ?
say row .
thank you never mind that i'm just trying not to hit myself in the face with this .
pretty much but also simultaneously hit my dad in the face with it .
rattle .
what're you doing ?
you really do like that rattle don't you ?
you going to say ?
so what are you thinking about getting her for christmas then ?
a large cardboard box, told you .
erh, she's got a, erh, she's got the the toot toot airport which we bought when we were in america, erm, from costco, erm, and she's got like a .
what kind of size was that ?
is it not huge ?
no .
it's it's actually it's the smallest of the toot toot ranges .
erh, and it it was really cheap .
erh, it was an absolute pain getting it back to the hotel but it fit really well in our suitcase so that was fine .
did it, jennifer ?
is that so ?
that's a grumble grumble isn't it jennifer ?
so she's so she's got that and she's got a few other bits and pieces .
i've gotta decide which ones are going to go from father christmas and which ones are going to go from .
mummy and dad .
mummy and daddy .
but i didn't want to buy her too much because it's not like she's going to remember or particularly care .
i imagine .
well she's not going to really remember and you've also got a lot of other people who are going to buy her stuff as well .
and the only other thing i've bought her that i'm really quite excited about is this scuttlebug .
okay .
it's like a little fold up scooter thing which is quite cool .
well not scooter, it's, she sits on it so .
well you kind of scoot along on it though .
but .
okay .
but now that her legs are beginning to go then i thought that that would be quite good .
but i got that from costco here when it because it was on offer the other week so it was like thirteen or fourteen pounds .
it was great, it was like awesome .
well that's not bad .
the other problem is that all children's toys cost at least ten pounds apparently .
heh heh .
ow .
not where i've seen them from, they don't .
on no no jenn, not the laptop .
there goes auntie isabelle !
hello .
she's gone .
down the bottom .
there we go, up again !
that's better .
don't try and minimize her .
that's daddy's job .
nice .
jenn .
hello ?
hang on .
what you doing ?
jennifer are you pausing me ?
don't .
cheeky face .
don't swipe her off to the right and open the whatever that was .
dashboard .
it looked like a calculator .
dashboard i think it was .
what are you doing jenn ?
so has jennifer got a wish list yet ?
she's got a wish list on mine but, erh, there's only one item in it .
it well it start .
well you could set you could set up another wish list under yours and call it jennifer's .
that what it that's what it is but, erh, it's only got one item in it just now .
okay .
erh because i just haven't been very proactive .
stops you playing with it .
i know, well i figured she'd come forward again .
whereas matthew's got a boeing seven four seven, an international space station, an one car, a tornado .
and mad men .
manuals .
yep .
well .
and some knives .
i'd quite like the mad men to be honest but .
it's quite expensive, isn't it ?
it is .
sixty quid .
battlestar galactica's still on there too .
is it ?
well .
the box set .
we should probably try and get the still game box set at some point .
we've got some of the, like the single .
erh, we need to, i need, i do need to update it .

does archie like lettuce ?
he likes playing with lettuce .
why does he not like eating it ?

uhhuh, really, is that is that are you going to have a a name ?
that's that's quite a name .
i'm not sure everybody will be able to pronounce that though .
yep .
the thing is if you have a name that nobody can pronounce it doesn't make you much of a superhero .
you know and it'it would be quite difficult for them to write about you in all the newspapers .
because i don't know how you'd write that .
you've gotta think about the spelling as well as how you'd say it .
which is why when we say to you .
but that's why when we say to you the squealing .
the squealing doesn't work !
because you can't write it down and nobody else speaks in squeal !
i know, i don't squeal .
no .
daddy doesn't squeal .
well he does sometimes but .
you going to s ?
why don't you sing me a song instead of squealing ?

i do find you funny .
i do find you funny .
you're a funny bunny .
num .
num .
while you have your sandwich shall i read you a story ?
we've got a lovely story called “the super sandwich” .
let us see if i can find it .
dear .
here it is .
here's “the super sandwich” .
going to read this to you while you have your lunch .
it's illustrated by catherine vaser .
with a funny little thing above the .
i think that's what that means .
it's got four felt fillings wo .
let's make a sandwich with fantastic fillings .
i'm putting in something from my pot .
my favorite spaghetti, nice and hot .
look, here's some spaghetti .
sandwich with spaghetti in .
that's a bit strange .
what do you want to put in the sandwich, lion ?
ooh lion's having a little think .
fresh from my garden small and neat, a handful of peas so fresh and sweet .
ooh, they do look sweet .
what do you want to put in the sandwich, monkey ?
what's monkey got here ?
sticky jam thickly spread, that's what i like on my bread .
look, he's got lots of jars of jam .
these ones have cherries on so i guess they're cherry jam .
these ones have got strawberries on .
he's got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen jars of jam !
and here's the jam here to put on .
it's all got little seeds all over it .
what do you want to put in the sandwich, mouse ?
ooh, mouse has got a .
little clue here .
he's holding a knife that's got a little .
bit of a dent at the end .
it looks like a cheese knife to me .
although it might be quite a squeeze, there must be room for a slice of cheese .
this sandwich has spaghetti on the bottom and then a slice of bread and then there are peas and another slice of bread and then jam and another slice of bread and then a slice of cheese and another slice of bread !
five slices of bread, crikey .
we've cut it in four, it's time to eat it .
we think it's delicious and nothing can beat it .
what a funny sandwich containing spaghetti, peas, jam and cheese !
your sandwich has just got plain old cream cheese .
yes .
no spaghetti .
no peas, no jam, just cream cheese .
really ?
you like it just the same ?
is that what you just told me ?
yes ?
you're a hungry horse .
you're a hungry horse .
now we've got some very exciting news hannah, daddy has got the weekend off .
yes !
so we can do lots of lovely things can't we ?
yes we can .
what could we do this weekend ?
maybe we could go to gorgie farm ?
really ?
is that what you'd like to do ?
go and see some pigs .
perhaps we could go and visit grandma ?
do you want to go visit grandma ?
and gran gran ?
no, not so keen on that idea ?
well i think we might anyway .
really ?
we could go for a nice walk up the hill if the weather stays like this .
it's a beautiful bright day isn't it ?
lovely and cold and blustery, but sunny .
yes .
we could take maisy out to practise riding her bike .
getting very good .
the next size up for you both .
it's a bit of a boring job though .
hu what else could we do what else could we do ?
we could .
do you know i can't think .
i can't think what we could do .
i'm sure there must be lots of things .
maybe they'll be a nice bonfire display on this weekend .
go and see some fireworks .
maybe you're a bit little for that .
think maisy would like them .
what could we do for you ?
that you would like to do ?
uhu .
g g .
gaga .
you would just like to roll around though wouldn't you, and practise standing up ?
yes .
i think so .

they because she hits him because she wants to talk ?
he .
he wants to talk ?
he to rapunzel .
i think that i think that .
fl erh rapunzel was a little bit scared to begin with because she didn't know flinn rider and he climbed up the tower to find somewhere to hide and he thought it was empty .
and rapunzel had never seen him before and she thought he might have been a bad person .
but i i think .
so that's why i think she maybe was a bit scared and help and thought she was protecting herself .
c careful please .

daddy said don't touch that .
i did .

boo !
boo !
aa .
and the this friend, .
he makes a squishy scrunchy noise .
pull, !

it's a laugh isn't it ?
it's a laugh !
eir .
yes .
now do you know what ?
if we're going to get anything done today .
and mummy is slightly paralyzed by the list of things that we have to do today .
but if we're going to get any of it done, i think you maybe need to get dressed .
what do you reckon ?
is it time to put on clothes ?
where's you nappy ?
that feels like a busy nappy .
i know i know it's not going to be popular changing it but you'll feel so much better afterwards .
you will .
be all nice and clean .
haha, how about i choose your clothes while we have a little chat ?
what kind of mood are you in ?
are you in a dungaree mood ?
or a trousers mood ?
you care far more than i ever do .
i just want to be comfy .
comfy .
is that what you want to be, a comfy boy ?
can't say i blame you .
who wouldn't ?
right .
hello peekaboo .
right let's see what lurks within .
got your indoor kind of dungarees .
they're really cosy .
actually we've not had those out for a while .
little size check i think daniel .
waa .
because you just seem to grow so quickly .
i know .
waa .
woohoo it's a nine to twelve situation daniel, it's a result .
do you fancy giving those a go ?
i think they'd be lovely and soft if we get down to soft play .
i do .
need to reorganize your drawers daniel because there's stuff here that we just never get round to looking at .
the terrible waste .
ooh .
baa .
i know .
hello .
are you just a smiley boy ?
boa .
well indeed .
eer .
the only problem with those daniel is that they might not be very warm if we walk .
shall we have a look and see what this weather's doing ?
shall we open the blind ?
are you ready ?
are you steady ?
up it goes .
ooh, now, looking promising for a little walk .
looking promising daniel .
now the good news about a walk .
is it's nice fresh air and they'll be lots to see !
the bad news is i think we want super cosy trousers because it's probably not that warm out there really .
super cosy breeches !
what do you think ?
right .
let's have a change of heart then and find some super cosy ones .
sound good ?
nne .
eer .
right .
so but we must not forget about those for another day .
you remind me okay ?
now, these look pretty cosy daniel .
mummy, whatever .

i am at best ambivalent .
however .
r .

ehah .
those toes are in the air !
what're they doing up there ?
are they ?
are they looking up at the sky ?
you're quite happy in there aren't you ?
do you know while you're quite happy i might do a little bit of tidying up in here .
would that be good ?
say mummy i care about as much about that as i do about what i'm wearing .
panic not young daniel i was not leaving .
just popping outside to get some of the things we need to tidy up .
eer .
i know !

i think it's a .
bit of a hit .
is it a winner sweetheart ?
how good is that ?
honeybun .
see soup's a bit tricky to eat because it's .
it's easier if mummy puts it in your mouth with a spoon .
because .
if you have a go at feeding yourself .
i know you like to do that now .
but if you do that it'll be everywhere !
and then the mice will have more to eat .
yes ?

one two .
three four .
and you threw the red one too didn't you ?
well done .
can you get them out ?
you going to stand up with it ?
that's a clever idea mister .
but there isn't a lot of resistance is there ?
so do you want me to hold it still ?
do you want me to hold it still ?
are you going to stand up or you going to do it on your knees ?
are you going to stand up or are you going to do it on your knees ?
what do you think ?
and the ribbon is going everywhere is it ?
go on then, why don't you stand up ?
mum'll provide the resistance .
that's it .

go on then .
show me how it's done .
show me how it's done .

a !
well done you !
and you're going to walk with it are you ?
so remember, it goes quickly .
it goes quickly .
shall i help ?
look at you !
well done you little man .
i can't get across the floor quick enough .
you're going so fast i think there's going to be a crash in a minute .
you just using it as your transporter ?
just using it as your transport ?
are you just going to get to the cardboard box ?
alright, well done .
up we go again .
well done .

do you want to do a bit more ?

haha !
you're going to use me are you ?
you're going to use me as your leverage to stand up .
i see .
no, you're going to keep going are you ?
free and easy aye ?
i i think i think emptying that box is probably a really good idea .
yep, a really good idea to empty that box .
i don't know what nursey's doing it in it anyway .
because that's a fruit and veg box isn't it ?
carrots and apples and onions and a nurse !
she doesn't belong there !
she doesn't belong there !
that's it, you pull her out .
a .
you're going to try that on her head are you ?
those boxes, i say, they make a great sound don't they ?
nurse is back in, yep .
shall we put the ribbon in ?
shall we put the ribbon into the box ?
into the box .
and some bricks .
into the box .
there we are .
not the yellow one .
and not the ribbon either you say .
is it stuck on your fingers ?
can i help ?
there we are .
what about the bricks ?
one out .
are you going to eat that one ?
two out .
and momma only put four in didn't she .
are they all coming out ?
three .
one left .
four !
shall we do it again ?
momma put them in again ?
one two three four .
one out, good job .
two out .
do you have to have a little taste of all of them ?
three out .
no tasting that one didn't didn't fancy it ?
that is quite a lot of banging, ooh !
quite a lot of banging .
shall i do it again ?
one two three .
where's the other one quick quick ?
four !
taste the red one .
what do you think ?
and then throw it .
what do you think ?
what do you think, yellow one or a red one next ?
ooh !
that's a clever idea, that empties them all out doesn't it ?
because you turned the whole thing upside down .
well done, you're putting them in then .
that's a super idea .
that's a great idea zach .
can you put them into the box ?
can you put them into the box ?
banana flavored or brick flavored ?
i see i see what you're trying to do .
that's nursey's bed is it ?
not for the bricks at all .
good throwing .
so later on we'll talk about the fact that actually throwing hard things isn't such a good idea .
but right now i'm not sure you're going to get that .
is that one for me ?
thank you !
thank you !
ta !
zach have it ?

or you're thinking about that red brick .
are you going to climb over me ?

is mummy hiding it somewhere ?
you are smart as two smart things mister .
you are .
it's disappeared hasn't it ?
what a funny thing .
what a funny thing .
are you looking for it in the box ?
it's a good idea because momma did keep on putting things in that box didn't she ?
it's a good idea but it's not there is it ?
no .
momma is perfecting her innocent look .
i have no idea zach .
well done, got the brick !
what a lot of banging .

what about ?
what about this one ?
this is a long book .
long ago .
in a faraway land .
lived a poor orphan named aladin .
one day in the market aladin took some bread .
the sultan's guard chased him but aladin and his pet monkey abu escaped .
then .
aladin saw two hungry children and gave the bread to them .
things will change .
he told abu ".
someday .
we'll live in a palace .
that afternoon the sultan told princess jasmine she was to marry a prince in three days .
i will marry only for love .
she cried ".
jasmine disguised herself and ran away .
in the market she took an apple .
but couldn't pay the angry fruit seller .
aladin rescued her .
the merchant called the guard .
they released the princess .
but took aladin to the palace dungeon .
meanwhile jafar , the sultans's evil counselor , disguised himself as a prisoner .
help me find a very special lamp !
he said to aladin ".
and i'll set you free .
god bless you .
jafar took aladin and abu to the cave of wonders .
touch nothing but the lamp !
he said ".
a magic carpet appeared and led aladin to the lamp .
aladin reached for it .
abu grabbed a ruby .
the cave began to collapse .
the magic carpet saved aladin and abu .
but all three were trapped .
what's so special about this old lamp ?
aladin wondered aloud ".
as aladin rubbed the dust off .
an enormous genie appeared .
he said .
i can grant you three wishes .
now let's get out of here !
aladin's first wish was to become a prince .
so jasmine would marry him .
he promised to use his third wish to set the genie free .
later that day aladin arrived at the palace in grand style .
i'm prince ali .
he told .
the sultan .
that evening prince ali took jasmine for a ride on his wonderful carpet .
soon she became suspicious .
aren't you the boy from the market ?
she asked ".
no .
i really am prince ali .
he said .
then the magic carpet took them back to the palace .
that was wonderful .
she said ".
sighed jasmine .
she had fallen in love .
things are finally going right .
aladin happily told abu ".
but again jafar had ordered the guards to get rid of aladin .
after the guards tossed aladin into the sea .
he summoned the genie and used his second wish to save his own life .
aladin returned to the palace with the lamp .
but iago , jafar's parrot , stole it .
so jafar became the genie's master .
make me sultan !
jafar commanded ".
make jasmine and her father my slave !
the genie was forced to obey .
jafar used his second wish to become a powerful sorcerer .
changed aladin back into a beggar and sent him far away .
the magic carpet .
helped aladin return to the palace .
jafar was furious that aladin found a way to trick him .
the genie still has more power than you'll ever have .
he said .
it worked .
jafar used his third wish to become a genie .
but he forgot one thing .
every genie must live in a lamp and so .
jafar disappeared .
the sultan decided to let jasmine choose her own husband .
i choose you .
she told aladin ".
aladin's dream had come true .
but he didn't forget his third wish .
he said ".
genie , you're free forever .
the end .
you say ".
no not another “the end” .
see !
books have a “the end” .
and when it's .
the end .
there is no more .
you can only just start them over again .

maybe it's time for a diapie change too .
on top of everything else .
let's see !
open the window on the world !
the window on the world is open and it's icy out there .
don't want to fall down .
we wouldn't want to fall down out there .
that might not be so good ?
why you have to get diapie changed .
alex .

it's just a diapie change .
well , honey , you just gotta get the diapie changed .

so why you fussing ?
why you fussing ?
there you go .
you're all fixed up .
and what does it say ?
it says ".
it's time to read .
there's dog .
and a bird .
the elephant .
the alligator .
and a cat .
the octopus .
all that stuff was up there .
that was very neat stuff .
very neat .
very interesting .
and very neat .
we'll move this out of your way .
alright .
now you have all the toys .
let me take this stuff out of here !
put it up here .
god bless you .
you going to try it ?
what's that ?
my very first winnie the pooh .
pooh's neighborhood .
let's see !
i say .
it's a splendid day in the neighborhood .
said owl ".
it's a nice day here too .
said winnie the pooh ".
exactly what i'm saying .
said owl ".
a perfectly splendid day in the neighborhood .
which neighborhood .
are we talking about ?
asked pooh ".
neighborhood .
said owl .
our neighborhood .
the place where we live and our neighbors live and are neighborly .
said pooh ".
isn't it ?
quite .
said owl ".
now i'm off for an owl's eye view .
he flew up and circled once around pooh's house .
what does it look like from up there ?
called pooh ".
i can see the hundred acre woods spread out below me .
said owl ".
and it's a fine place indeed .
as owl flew off .
pooh began to think about what it means to live in a neighborhood .
he thought perhaps he would take a neighborly present to his closest neighbor , .
piglet .
he took a honey pot .
out of his cupboard and tied a nice blue ribbon around it .
then he tucked it comfortably under his arm .
and stomped down the path towards piglet's .
house .
but when he reached his thoughtful spot .
which is halfway between his house and piglet's .
pooh suddenly had a thought .
i .
could .
take this path straight to piglet's house .
or .
i could go up the path .
and around the whole neighborhood .
and sooner or later .
the path would take me to piglet's house anyway .
and that is what he did .
after he had walked for a time .
he came to the house where kanga and roo lived .
hello , kanga .
said pooh ".
i'm just on my way to deliver this neighborly present .
to piglet .
but , pooh dear .
piglet lives that way .
said kanga pointing down the very path by which pooh had come ".
said pooh .
but today .
i'm going .
the long way .
i see .
said kanga ".
in that case .
perhaps you should join us for a snack .
come on , pooh !
cried roo ".
we're going to the picnic spot .
pooh said he was feeling a bit eleven o'clock .
so they all went together past the sandy pit where roo plays .
up to the picnic spot to share a little something .
half an hour and one picnic basket later .
pooh thanked kanga .
tucked piglet's honey pot back under his arm .
and stomped down the path towards rabbit's house .
come back !
okay i guess this book was just a little bit too long .

no .
we're not going to go play at the window .

eve took some fruit and ate it .
she also gave some to adam .

then they realized they were .
they were naked .
so they sewed fig leaves together and covered themselves .
and they hid from god .
in the cool of the day .
god called adam .
where are you” ?
where are you” ?
adam answered .
“i heard you and i was afraid because i was naked .
so i hid” .
god said .
“who told you that you were naked” ?
have you eaten from the tree that i told you not to eat from” ?
adam said .
that's right .
they're in big trouble .

adam said .
“eve gave me some fruit and i ate it” .
then god said to eve .

once i watched a turtle who wasn't watching me .
bumbling in his turtle shell clumsily bobbing his turtle head to and fro .
going on his turtle legs .
going slow .
snapping at a buzzing fly .
snap swallow wink .
turning toward a shallow pool .
wants a drink .
bumbling bobbling stop and go .
once i watched a turtle .
and now i know there are lots more things to see when you go slow .
that's pretty cool .
although daddy probably wouldn't like it that .
there's a turtle poem on his birthday .
because he's not a turtle .
