you know that .
polka dot .
dress kind of thing that she's she's making them ?
was there something i was supposed to get for your costume for the musical ?
you didn't bring home any notices yet .
no .
just black tights .
i have the black leotard .
and i can wear black shorts under them .
give me ?
because .
you know why because .
we need !
shorts under them because .
the dancing .
we're going to be .
on the stage on the ground .
you know what i mean .
on the .
ground of the stage .
because that's the way it starts .
you mean you'll be going to be sitting !
on the floor ?
i'm going to be lying !
on the floor like this !
so .
do you .
have some black shorts ?
or .
dark !
colored shorts .
i could wear the .
but she's making the costumes .
did you say i hadta pass in some money though .
for the costumes ?
yes !
five dollars .
five dollars .
so ?
you should pass that in .
it's due tuesday .
when you go back .
really ?
i need it .
june seventeenth you said ?
well that's a ways away .
i know .
i can't believe .
that we're not doing a ballet dance !
yep .
we're doing that next year .
ballet dances .
so you're just doing .
tap and jazz ?
i know .
it stinks that we didn't do !
a ballet dance .
clyde .
down .
maybe they couldn't fit in three dances .
clyde .
come on clyde .
move it .
i know you want to be a part of the family ?
come here .
tap song is seven minutes long and we have to tape it to three minutes .
we have three minutes .
you mean you have to .
cut it down ?
right .
because .
a seven !
minute .
we can't !
do a seven minute dance .
you're pretty well tapped out by the time you finish that „ ?
tapped out already and we haven't even finished the !
dance !
but our costumes are really pretty for that one .
so i guess this musical's going to be after i mean the .
recital's going to be after .
school's !
over that week ?
yep .
so that's good .
i remember last year katie's recital was on one of the dates of the musical .
and she couldn't be there .
she had !
to be in the recital .
and kate was too .
did sister have to work ?
did did she just did she .
have school this week ?
she did .
when did she get her easter break ?
she .
didn't get it .
she got a spring break the last week in march .
she didn't get an easter break .
why didn't .
she get an easter break ?
well .
i don't think .
they celebrate it .
because .
you know .
they easter's on a sunday and .
she had already had her spring break so .
it's a holiday .
maybe what we could do is .
she didn't have any extra time off .
i guess .
then the monday holiday was only a monday .
holiday in massachusetts .
why ?
because it was patriot's !
day .
and patriot's day is a .
massachusetts holiday not a .
rhode island .
nationwide .
holiday .
you know it's about .
paul revere and the .
right .
one if by land two if by sea and .
riding .
through concord and lexington and all that business .
concord in massachusetts ?
yep .
you know the british are coming the british are coming !
i know .
i've heard that story every morning .
isn't that what the .
patriot's day .
commemorates ?
i guess .
bunker hill and all that .
wasn't that part of what the marathon was about ?
you know because .
approximately the distance between .
hopkinton and boston that the .
people did ?
i thought that was .
boston .
i .
i don't know about that .
paul revere's ride or whatever it w .
i don't know .
boston tea party .
no that was something different .
no ?
okay i remember that .
that was .
probably .
it's called patriot's day because it's the day the football players start their spring training .
right ?
yes .
right .
i don't think so .
could i have this ?
do you want more milk chi ?
sure .
you want .
half milk half chocolate ?
please .
you can turn this around so you can reach it if you want .
it's pinkish because it got mixed in .

thousand islands dressing .

but i thought they went off together in a taxi .
if he doesn't .
no .
he's somewhere around here .

now bro's gone again .
well we'll just eat breakfast .
so because they switched the practice back to six clock it doesn't give you as much time before practice ?
i know .
so .
i thought we'd get that done right away ?
now today .
is the twenty third .
your puzzle project's due tomorrow ?
well the book is read so .
this afternoon what do we do cut out the pieces of the puzzle and you just write the different clues ?

do you need a piece of posterboard to put it on ?
well i needta run out today so is there anything that you need for it ?
just more pencils .
more pencils ?
do we need a new pencil sharpener again ?
because mummy lost that one at church .
thank you .
you know i wasn't even thinking when i was working on that card last night .
because i was using one of the marking pens for the laundry ?
to do the black border for the stained glass ?
right here !
hi honey .
stop !
talk .
what ?
it went through to the middle of the card .
now say there he is !
mummy say there he is .
so now i have to do it all !
over again the front .
mom !
there he is .
not you !
chi and you .
chi look .
there he is !
there he is !
shut up !
what ?
i knew you were going to hit .
i'm going to hit you i can that i want .
good thing it's only a balloon .
your brother would've been bruised all over the way you've been beating him with it bro .
say there he is .
let chi .
i'll show you .
there he is .
he .
bro !
mommy's not here right now she's coming back .
joey !
daddy's a little bit mad at bro .
joey .
joey .
sorry about this taperecorder but .
we're having trouble because of bro .
see ?
okay .
see now ?
doesn't that come out nice ?
and then what i do is when i cut .
the arch into like a stained glass window ?
this s piece here and this piece here and then s around the edge is going to have to be black .
that's the lead in the stained glass window you see ?
so the this is for the older children in sunday school .
i shouldn't call them children they're young adults .
then i have to design one for the younger children .
but see what happened when i was coloring in to do my leaded stained glass with the black marker ?
so i can't draw my wheat and my grapes on the inside because it came right through .
you know what you should have done ?
i should've put a piece of cardboard !
in there .
you should've did it like this !
with a k piece of cardboard under it .
but i can't do it like that without making i have to make sure that it it matches .
look at that .
well the one good thing is is that i can i can quickly trace over this .
because my drawing is so dark .
but i needta remember to put something in the middle here so it will not bleed through .
well so that's nice ?
but i haven't decided what to do for the .
children .
you know like bro's age ?
i still like my original though .
on on the .
tissue paper .
i like that one .
so here's my what do you think ?
i was thinking of writing that down the bottom .
or maybe across the front .
no no i think i'll call pastor or stephanie and run it by them .
no i think i know .
alleluia across and then alleluia down in there .
no only in one spot .
why ?
i don't know .
i still have to come up .
with what .
stephanie and i have to figure out what we're going to put inside for a prayer .
do you have homework this week for first communion class ?
no .
you don't have any homework this week ?
except for that crossword puzzle .
not in the book .
should we stop right here and then see how we .
no .
no reason to stop right here .
well this is in january where .
what should we do ?
i mean is it about ?
how are we what are we doing ?
well i had taperecorder going .
before but you didn't know it .
not today .
a while ago .
sometimes i think that .
it's not a bad idea to start it up without anybody knowing it .
on side or ?
it said .
i think i have some taperecords on side .
i'm sorry ?
i think i have some taperecords on side .
i don't know .
no .
well bro has school today .
and i have to pick him up so i needta come get you at school .
instead i have him get on the bus .
chi .
honey .
pick me up instead of me going on the bus .
no .
no which means we will not get here until like almost three thirty .
so that takes out some time of your homework too so .
do you want some more apple jacks ?
i had a big bowl .
i know .
they're almost gone .
i had a coupon for them .
they're almost gone .
well i'll ask melissa if she's going to use her coupon .

mom .
can i have some more milk ?
more milk ?
that bowl's full of milk first and middle name .

yes it is .
i couldn't put more milk in it if you wanted me to .
you'd be floating down the hallway .
i wish i had a thousand b boxes of apple jacks and put them out the room and dump milk in .
i'd eat my way out .
i'd probably make it in three days .
dad .
what ?
his basketball practice has been switched back to six instead of seven .
which kind of cuts across for me you know what i mean time wise with dinner on tuesdays with picking bro up at school ?
but that's the story .
so .
you know i don't .
okay .
i'm on your side .
whatever makes it easier .
is this your math homework for tomorrow today i mean ?
no .
no .
honey .
i really want you to start using the graph paper i got you so you can make some better organizational skills in terms of keeping your numbers .
square .
you keeping them ov over and b up above and below .
the right way you're doing better with that and your decimal points .
but in terms of the size and you're going up hill when you do your problems or down hill .
with the the graph paper will help you get into a better habit .
this is garbage though .
well still .
you know what i'm saying .
you're going up hill .
you gotta keep all your numbers the same size .
but he needs to use the same amount of space for a problem .
and i that's why i got him the graph paper .
that will help .
so how come he's using that paper ?
habits .
you know that's what they give you at school for math .
and of course they're not going to spend money on graph paper .
mommy .

because i wanted !
something else .

keep angel company when .
you know how sometimes you leave her home alone ?
well she'd have a little puppy to play with her .
or get in trouble with her .
but .
but .
it would keep me and chi both !
entertained as well as the puppy .
and angel .
we could toss the puppy and then she tosses angel and then i toss her angel and she tosses the puppy .
and this time we can train it to jump through a hula hoop .
because angel didn't like it .
but maybe he'll be .
the puppy can be on that's my dog !
if we train it good enough ?
or well enough .
we could make it jump over the picnic table !
and jump over water fountains ?
this one looked as timid as angel .
well .

we hadta do this project .
my god !
who's that bobby'mot's brother playing with ?
that was so long ago .
i don't know .
with red hair ?
but .
we hadta .
we hadta do this project for science !
where .
we had this big yellow sheet of paper ?
and she told miss mccullough ?
told us .
to try to find some like .
pollution .
or endangered animals ?
or pictures ?
or we can draw it .
so did you find any ?
i found .
some kind of monkey .
because they said .
on one of the the things that they sent grandmother?
in the mail ?
i cut cut it out of there .
a panda .
a panda .
some kind of monkeys .
and .
i forget the other one .
and then i had an extinct animal ?
and i had a picture of a woolly mammoth ?
then i had pollution .
where did you get the woolly mammoth ?
on one of the things .
one of the cards .
that they send ma in the mail .
i want to see that .
and then .
i had .
pollution .
there was this guy like .
wearing gloves like .
near a river .
on a river bank almost ?
and he picked up this rock and it was covered in this yellow green slime ?
where did you get that .
national geographic .
national geographic .
and i put i wrote above it .
and then .
and if i didn't save those books .
you wouldn't of had them „ would you ?
and then i put wo .
i have to add that though .
one thing .
to my .
do you have to glue them on ?
i i taped them .
because i'd like you to tell miss .
your teacher .
i forget her name .
but .
your science teacher please t .
what ?
i just did wh what brian did .
sucked the whole thing down ?
the whole thing .
you're not supposed to do that .
that's rude !
he ate the whole .
one whole yolk .
like brian does ?
he eats all around the light ?
i didn't i couldn't .
you didn't you didn't eat the any ham yet did you .
the ham's delicious .
it is ?
better than it usually is ?
great .
i !
like it .
and .
i have to add the word .
well especially .
because i b i got a picture of a whole bunch of cars ?
like in a big car lot ?
the ham is !
good .
and i put .
pollution causers ?
i have to put one kind .
well i would like you to get the pictures back .
especially where they were ma's .
from your .
science teacher .
okay .
plus you'll probably need it again somewhere along the line .
the woolly mammoth is a very unusual picture to find now .
and then i had .
but we could certainly have gotten more sets of them .
i showed like a for a big fire going along the ground .
somewhere ?
and then i showed and then i showed like .
this big open area ?
but it's full of cut down trees ?
and you see there's one man sawing a tree .
like cu it's already cut down .
but he's cutting it into pieces .
and those are my categories .
good ?
tell her the rainfall .
i hope we do .
do again what we did last week in .
it was fun .
last weekend ?
last week !
at science .
what ?
miss mccullough bought this .
energy .
generator ?
right ?
and like .
like .
she's not .
immune but she can't really feel it ?
electricity ?
right ?
so she put her hand on the electricity on the electric generator ?
right ?
and she just kept it there .
and then she called each table up .
and if .
you wanted to do it .
you could like form a chain with her ?
and each time you grabbed onto her hand .
you get a shock ?
and you hadta hold on .
because if you went like this .
and let go you would have to do it again .
and then would somebody else have to touch you ?
would they get a shock ?
you would too !
god !
so did you do it ?
how many times ?
we only gotta go up once .
but sometimes .
since people wouldn't go up she let other people go up from the same tables that she'd already picked .
and then .
after that .
she'd have kids come up and roll up their sleeves ?
and put their arm !
near the generator ?
to feel the shock on their arm ?
and then she had kids .
if they wanted to touch the generator ?
that's the only thing i wouldn't do .
i'll not touch the generator .
i mean everything but !
touch the generator .
why didn't you touch the generator ?
did she touch it ?
would would it have been a worse shock ?
would it have been a worse shock than the one you got from each other ?
well how come she didn't get shocked ?
how come she didn't get shocked ?
it probably doesn't bother her .
because she's so used to it .
she probably does it for every class .
getting shocked doesn't bother her .
she's .
her major !
was science .
but .
but it was a way .
way !
better .
it would've been a way way !
better shock .
when the .
electricity conducts !
through each of you ?
it gets sometimes it gets weaker and sometimes it gets stronger ?
and i was like next to miss mccullough ?
and .
it was .
kind of big .
but not really .
and then when i put my arm close ?
i looked this way ?
i put it closer ?
the static ?
it was weird .
did you ever shake your .
blanket out ?
at night ?
isn't it cool ?
lorraine used to love to go in the room .
when me and lorraine shared a room ?
she used to like to go into her room and shake her blanket .
when it came out .
do that with your hair .
when i was little ?
and we had the room downstairs ?
get static electricity .
when when you went to sleep „ right ?
i used to s creep up in the corner of my bed „ right ?

no it doesn't work on the scrambler ?
she can't tape on it ?

and we'll be in florida .
i know we're leaving for florida in like a week in a half .
tomorrow we go to the christmas carol .
a week and two .
at the north shore ?
we've gotta dress up fancy for that !
not fancy but like not .
well you always dress nice so it should be fine .
but not like gym clothes .
well they're sh they're talking about the kids that show up at school every day in sweatpants and t shirts .
like kevin .
like kevin doesn't have any jeans .
what do you mean kevin doesn't have any jeans ?
how can he not have jeans ?
he doesn't have jeans .

he only has he only has two sweaters .
in the winter ?
my god !
you mean .
he's a warm !
kid .
sheesh !
does he have a good winter jacket ?
nope .
well that's not very good .
i think this needs a little more sugar .
okay .
our dog the real beggar .
and my friend kevin never gets cold .
are you sure about that ?
because he really should have some winter clothes on .
that's enough sugar .
what ?
one teaspoon ?
no i put about eighty teaspoons in before that one .
do you want some more waffles ?
well you you have more time now since you're leaving later for school since it's cold .
so you have like half an hour more .
i mean thirty five minutes .
do you know when your grades come out for your next quarter ?
in january .
either january or february .
so you needta be concentrating very hard on bringing those grades up and working hard on your effort and .
then we have one in april i think .
and one in june .
maybe march or maybe june .
so i want you to really think when you're doing your homework .
and i'm at school and you're and you're trying to get your homework done i want you to really concentrate on the things we talked about at school yesterday like putting a little more effort into it .
and proof reading your papers and double checking your math okay ?
and the computer for the vehicle called the amazon trail .
at school ?
yep .
and it's cool because what you do if you hunt for food you have to you look over the side and you have a a spear and you have to try to catch a fish .
my god .
here it's really hard .
i've like three logs .
what does the game teach you ?
well there are symbols at the bottom where you can like check up on your supply ?
there's this really cool one where your boat goes like this .
and you turn into the forest .
and you can take pictures of pe of things .
and and .
i and there's a photo album .
and i think you needta fill it up .
i ha i barely have it all filled up .
is it like the oregon trail ?
a little .
you have to you have to keep up on your supplies .
but you have just have supplies and it's taking place now .
it's in a w a different part of the country .
the amazon ?
amazon .
that's not in our country .
m but it sounds a lot like the amazon trail .
i mean the oregon trail .
you gotta keep albums and figure things out .
well actually in the .
you just keep paddling .
you know watch out for other boats .
once i passed through fog .
so you needta be careful .
and with that you with oregon you don't have to keep an album .
it helps take care of your supply and .
didn't you have a diary or something you gotta keep ?
a journal or something like that ?
no .
i thought you did .
they keep one for you .
those that .
star wars compact disc rom that you asked for ?
dark forces .
well .
see the thing is i already told the stores that you wanted it but i ne i didn't check it out .
is it nasty ?
is it like those dungeons and dragons ?
no rebel .
no rebel assault is like that .
rebel assault ?
is that a star wars one ?
i'm surprised because it doesn't seem like star wars would be too violent .
no .
and the third one .
there's three ?
three star wars movies .
movies .
and princess leah was trapped in jabba's jabba the hut .
palace and she strangled him .
and she what ?
she pulled the chain so far .
ha hard .
it was connected to him .
and she yanked him off his catapult that he died .
that's gross .
but dark forces isn't anything like that .
well it can't be as bad as what i was reading about on the back of those dungeons and dragons games .
my god that one called hacksand have you heard of that ?
i didn't mean that i just wanted to .
this guy almost convinced me to buy it at the computer store .
i want .
hacksand !
my god i read the back of it and it was like your friends's dead corpses are everywhere .
blood and gore spew .
it was like !
i i've never even heard of that .
what i wanted is just dungeons and dragons advanced .
it's nasty .
well you ca .
that doesn't have as much gruesome .
well i asked whether it any of the dungeons and dragons games were not so violent and they said they're all !
violent .
because i know jamie had looked for games for you too that's about adventuring but not you know with all the nasty blood and guts and all that so we haven't been able to find one .
but dark forces isn't like that .
can't you just stick to math blaster or something like like that ?
math blaster .
save spot from the evil slug .
evil what ?
slug ?
slug .
that would be an adventure .
you're sarcastic !
you're back again aren't you toby lee ?
pet me mommy pet me !
look at the way like when you pet her she like totally almost sits on you .
you're a good dog .
yes you are !
isn't she ?
no she's so tired this morning .
that's how come she looks so cute .
yes .
and small .
you know we're having our big christmas dinner this saturday and jen and martin are going to come ?
are they going to stay for christmas ?
for christmas dinner .
they're not going to stay ?
not until the morning no .
then are we ca open christmas .
are are we all going to open like one christmas present that we get .
well here's .
they have presents under the tree .
okay here's the thing .
here's the thing .
alright i'm going to give them their present okay and if they bring any presents you can open them but you can't open any of the ones i'm giving you you know why ?
because we're just having a miniature christmas here at our house .
i'm not getting you the five thousand presents i usually get you for christmas okay ?
i know .
that santa brings .
because we're going down to florida .
okay ?
florida .
santa's coming to florida .
and it's called your grandparents okay ?
thank god !
see they can pay the bills in january .
you know what me and my friends joke about ?
we say that santa buys all the toys .
i know remember that one year when you went mommy why did santa leave the price tag on ?
my god !
and i was wondering how can you make plastic .
you were always too smart for that santa thing .
that santa gig .
but i always liked it .
i know .
well so anyway listen .
hold on .
we'll have .
so what game do you think is appropriate ?
wait .
hold on i want to talk about .
sim iowa .
well you know its going to be on our computer .
so you can play sim iowa with him okay ?
sim city two thousand .
no we already got regular sim city .
but that's way better .
no listen to me for a minute .
do you have a present for jen and martin ?
well maybe you could either buy something or make something before .
you could make jen an ear ring .
you know she loves your ear rings .
i think she only has one hole in her ear .
and that would be sort of strange if .
like she had two holes and i gave her .
one ear ring .
you could make her a pair .
and then she'll have two but i think that you should make them both something okay ?
but what should i make martin ?
maybe you can make him like a drawing ?
how about that ?
i have ten dollars ?
i needta buy toby we needta buy toby something .
i know we'll go out to the pet store .
okay ?
i didn't even know jen and martin were coming over .
well they are coming over .
is virginia going to come over ?
i doubt it .
i called her invited her and i doubt it .
it but she would love a pair of ear rings also .
you know what the other thing is is we ought to check in with the gallery and see how your ear rings are selling .
i was wondering whether you had thought about that when you went downtown the other day .
about popping in to see kathy and see how many of your ear rings have sold .
i think it'd be very good to check in before the end of the month .
well you know we're leaving .
i think that .
the gallery closes the day after we leave .
so you need you do needta check in with her and just pop in and say this week .
and then at the end of the next week you'll be picking up whatever you haven't sold which if you ask me i bet you sold all your ear rings .
hopefully .
so i think that you should just pop in and say okay ?
yep .
sometime this week .
maybe today maybe tomorrow after .
okay .
after school or something you could take your ten bucks and go up to to casa de modo and look for something for martin and jen .
you could just buy .
them one thing to share if you want to or you could make jen something and draw martin something .
i know .
i think i'll .
maybe walk up town on monday .
excuse me !
and .
i didn't call you go on i sneezed i didn't s say dear come here doggie .
mommy my name's achoo too mommy .
my name's toby .
my name's food .
my name's achoo .
my name's everything mommy so if you do anything i can jiggle my neck i'll i'll hello come .
i will i will i will .
if you pet me i'll come i'll come i'll come .

what laundry basket ?
the laundry basket .
which one ?
in the back hall .
you're kidding me !
are you making that up ?
she got in ?
okay .
now let me tell you .
why ?
what did she do once she got in ?
what was i going to say ?
when yesterday when pee wee barbara's cat ?
just to inform you guys .
she growled at toby and cats usually hiss so this one sounded like a dog .
it went .
what'd she whack toby ?
did you hear she's like .
i know because she has got a really mean growl .
bet she used to be a fighter cat .
well why what did toby do in the laundry basket ?
well she just got in looked around and got out .
she's bigger than the laundry basket though .
no she isn't !
a big german shepherd can't fit in the little laundry basket .
she hopped in .

toby !
one year .
toby .
come .
and she's still as goofy as she ever was .
sit down and finish your tea .
maybe on her birthday we can go down to the pound and say she doing good .
i know i thought about that maybe we could just take her back and and say .
you know let's show them how good she's doing .
we st i'm still going to write a letter to them you know .
but actually it might be better if we both wrote it or you wrote it .
you know it'd be nice .
how about we both wrote it ?
or i can type it on the computer and you could draw a picture .
or write it and like .
have toby step in ink .
and then go on the paper .
that's a good idea .
i'm loving it here at at mot and chi's house because i get to eat a lot of cookies .
and i'm getting very fat .
no no .
and when i go over to to brother's grandmother's i she gives me two whole cookies .
god barbara .
she gave her two whole cookies .
and then a half a cookie and then we gave her a half a cookie .
well no wonder we were all stuffed .
i know .
we all came home and threw up because of that .
and toby just was i'm enjoying that .
do do we have anymore ?
cookies ?
i kind of got rid of them .
kind of ?
kind of .
why you no take some fruit to school today .
but i wa i've been taking fruit for the last four days !
that's because we've got like five more pounds of pears in the fridge .
we have to eat them all .
come on .
i want to take like a junk snack for once .
no .
a junk snack's no good for you .
but mom all the other kids do it .
all the other kids ?
that's why they're all unhealthy and .
but they .
but once .
i i've been taking pears for the last four days and then apples .
well do you have any popcorn ?
do you have another ?
no .
junk food is no good for you .
if i had if i did i would have taken it by now .
it doesn't give you the good calories you need to get through school .
come on !
what are those other i thought isn't was it only is miss lee's class that she said no junk food for a snack ?
the other teachers let the kids bring junk food ?
no .
miss lee let us bring it on friday and miss aufrey let us just all bring it on friday .
excuse me !
miss melia doesn't really care .
miss melia doesn't care if you bring crap to school ?
no .
no .
she she doesn't allow like candy bars .
well that's good of her .
that stuff .
she allows like cookies .
do some kids bring that everyday ?
they a lot of kids bring that .
cookies everyday ?
carla when she wasn't sick she's been gone for like four days she she just .
like brought .
three cookies a day .
not just one day .
do they bring home lunch or school lunch ?
school .
and they bring chips for home room .
well so they eat a lot of junk food that's not healthy .
i just want one !
cookie .
listen to me .
are you still trading your school lunches ?
some of them .
have they been any better lately or are they still nasty ?
i practically threw up the other day .
no you would have gotten the flu anyway .
if the school lunch i know you don't like the school lunches but they didn't actually physically make you sick .
you were getting the flu .
mom .
they put meat !
in everything !
they put meat in everything ?
they put they put chicken and they they put like beef in their chicken mc nuggets .
they put every single thing but !
the hash browns .
they have meat !
if you look on the calendar .
it'll say .
chicken fillet .
then taco .
meat .
lettuce and all that stuff .
and then it'll keep doing that and doing that and doing that .
and another school lunch that doesn't have meat is is pizza .
i don't like meat because i'm a vegetarian and i don't eat meat any kind of meat including pepperoni because i know that's still pig but it's dried pig .
well .
chicken's the only animal that i eat .
well then we have to go back to making more home lunches .
home lunches .
but that's why i asked you if you were still trading .
but we need it .
are you trading your school lunches for for peanut butters and jellies and stuff ?
i try .
no one likes to trade when with me anymore because they get diarrhea .
everyone gets diarrhea or they throw up .
from the school lunch ?
one of the kindergarteners i mean one of the first graders they have lunch early and they went home about half an hour later .
alright .
well then we needta making home lunches again .
okay .
the problem is we can't afford to do that every single day because we don't enough money to buy that much food but .
we can certainly take a break you know from school lunches for a while .
and send you with .
not just peanut butter and jelly but will you think about taking like rice and stuff like that to school ?
because if you're going to be a vegetarian you know you have to learn to eat a lot more rice and other foods .
maybe rice .
maybe salad .
you have to .
they have some kids what they do is they go to mc donalds .
i ca the mcdon did you have a cookie hidden in your keys ?
what ?
no that's her food .
she's not eating .
well .
i the the when i went to bee one of the mothers brought big macs for everybody and i wanted a salad over it .
and then they all bugged me about what's a vegetarian what's a vegetarian ?
so i told them and so i really liked the mc donalds salads .
salads .
they put like cheddar cheese in it .
right .
so we could make a salad like that and put cheese in it .
that would be a very good idea .
you would take a salad to school ?
good .
as long as it's like not in this huge tupperware .
okay .
we'd better get the dog walked so you can get to school .
you ca you can make me a lunch right now .
okay .

more books .
well the caterpillar turned into a butterfly so i r i really think his caterpillar days are over .
not necessarily they can be sequels and .
you mean like about a different caterpillar .
no about the same caterpillar who's a butterfly .
so like the young butterfly chronicles or something ?
just like they did the young indiana jones chronicles .
i think they pretty much covered you know all the caterpillar's activities already .
okay .
no really it's fine .
no no .
i have another d idea to use the caterpillar involving a ca caterpillar .
okay .
maybe other caterpillars .
sure .
put =?
could a caterpillar tha that crawled up the tree .
think this might help ?
like the bottom of the tree .
no =?

zero two one four eight .
period .
and just write .
let's see .
you can write sincerely .
how do you spell it ?
that's what he needs to do .
okay .
comma .
well do i put it over here ?
you c it doesn't matter really where you where you sign it's just .
always under the .
closing .
that's how i do it .
first name .
you know what i mean ?
you didn't tell him full name so you better write .
last name over there or they won't know who you are .
first and last name .
alright ?
you want to read it out loud ?
alright .
dear eric carle .
how are you doing ?
i like your caterpillar book .
and i want to know if you are .
going to make any more children books .
i like your art work .
you're a good artist .
sincerely first name .
great .
i'm very impressed that you got the whole thing done in cursive .
that's cool .
good job .
i think your book is fabulous because you describe it well .
and i love caterpillars .
i like how you wrote it .
and i like your other books too .
my name is chi .
i have brown eyes .
i am nine and a half and my shoe size is two and a half .
my favorite thing is ballet .
my favorite color is blue .
i like climbing trees , fishing , swimming , and school .
i have one cat one dog and a bird .
ps i think you should write about a dog and ballet .
you guys can do it together .
just whatever she thinks of .
what we think about his book ?
write about it .
how many books does he have out ?
he has a lot .
does he ?
he really does actually .
a lot more than you'd think .
i don't needta read it because i read that five times .
you want her to read ?
she can if she wants but it's really up to her .
some children just look at the pictures it's really up to you .
you want to read it ?
show how good you read ?
she can read me the letter afterwards though .
okay ?
want her to do a letter today ?
yes .
okay .
just right here .
i'm going to do a couple other things while you guys do that so .
that would be .
great .
you can read it and then turn the pages .
why don't you do that ?
because if you gotta write about the book you should refresh your me .
i know you read it a lot though .
you don't remember .
the whole book do you ?
you do ?
what does that say ?
in the light light of there's standing a little caterpillar leaf .
close .
a little egg !
on a leaf .
you need to .
read !
it so you .
she does !
know .
want to read it ?
no .
why ?
i already know it mom .
okay .
now you're going to write him a letter tell him what you think about his book .
okay ?
do i have to write in cursive ?
whatever you like .
the teacher wants them to do cursive .
the teacher has a good thing .
i !
think it's very nice .
it's called the the learning log .
each kid has a note their own notebook .
want me to get it and see if she can see what my teacher wrote ?
and part of their homework every week is to turn in their learning log .
i don't know where .
it's in there on the couch .
your bag .
and they have to like refresh what they did for the week or .
it could be about anything .
outside activity or school something that they like do whatever and .
little comments about the holidays and then the teacher answers .
she retakes them all home i guess over the weekend and she answers them .
it's kind of nice .
it's like a one to one .
and i think sometimes the kids can write stuff that they probably wouldn't say to her ?
so it's a kind of nice idea .
i don't know if the other teachers do this .
a lot of teachers do but they call it something different .
i mean you might just have a journal and you'll take it home .
some people have a focus .
this is the first time she's ever .
and i thought it was nice .
some people don't .
great .
nice writing .
but she she says to them on their homework assignments the learning log cursive please .
i guess a lot of kids like to print .
how do you spell ?
crybaby stop .
stop being a crybaby .
stop being a crybaby .
yes .
how do you spell ?
it's nice though and i like reading it .
every couple of weeks i'll pick it up to read it to see what she wrote and what the teacher wrote .
she always has such nice things to say .
she writes a lot .
see what teachers do .
you know what i mean ?
i mean i'm sure she takes all that home and reads each kids's book and answers them and sometimes she writes really long and that's time-consuming .
there's twenty something kids .
you know ?
it's tough you know like they say teachers bring in their own stuff ?
i'm sure chi's teacher brings a lot of her own stuff in you know ?
for different crafts and stuff ?
parties whatever .
yep .
she'kitten all full of electricity when i touch her i get shocked .
good girl if you'd stop crying !
so much .
stop crying .
mom .
that's .
just erase that part .
see it's right here .
we should name kitten name mischief .
i know .
she gets into everything .
get .
down .
if you weren't here kitten probably wouldn't even be out here .
of course not .
she'd be sl this is usually when she's sleeping .
nosy .
look at kitten .
she's adorable .
you getting shocks ?
now i am .
you're a baby aren't you ?
it was funny when we had the other cat in the cellar and that one's full grown .
it looks so big .
and i said well i'll open the door a crack and let them look at each other ?
but i said to her don't let that big one in .
she'll kill her !
this was the one that didn't like the big cat .
and i said my god .
invading her territory ?
what should i say right there ?
how .
and then put a in front of that .
write to the side of .
they do a lot with story stuff in school .
they'll have to do a story about something and sometimes the teacher she said at conference some of the kids will write like a few paragraphs but chi's .
it just .
there'd be like three or four pages .
real descriptive and she said she's good in that area and she'll read them out loud she'll read hers out loud in front of the class which is nice .
maybe you could even write in a book someday ?
in between ballet classes ?
look caterpillar's on there .
it's cute .
what's down there a caterpillar ?
that's nice .
skipped this .
this is so it looks like i wrote a lot .
maybe you can mention that you write books .
is this the taperecorder that you're going to leave me ?
it's all set ?
yep .
i know one time i made mealtime tape and i waited forever .
and i says to chi i don't think they're ever coming back to get this .
i think it was ellen .
well that was there for a long !
time .
if you still have them you can always give them to me .
if you ever find it .
no she did come back eventually for it .
eventually ?
it was long time it seemed like a long time .
i think she forgot about us .
we're giving you this certificate also for the tapes .
one certificate to friendly's .
that's nice .
for doing that for us .
because i know it's a little bit of a hassle .
no .
sometimes usually when we're eating though i always say to her don't talk with food in your mouth just eat quietly .
then when we do these it's like and she'll go .
a little bit it's a little much .
stop it .
isn't it awful about that crazy guy down in brookline with the clinic ?
and he wants to now he wants to get out of jail and be a priest they say .
i know .
i don't think cardinal moll would like to have him as a priest though ?
sad though ?
very .
you just wonder what made us all like that .
and now this morning i i was watching the news in new york because they went in this morning to open up their clinics as usual and there were signs plastered all over the place if you come near near the premises or go inside you're going to be hurt or murdered like in boston .
it's awful .
and they were ripping down the signs .
so there's threats everywhere .
i wouldn't even want to work in one of those !
places .
i would've thought that he would have went past !
the receptionist and went right out to the source the doctors .
i mean i mean not that would have been any better but i saw these poor one girl was only twenty seven and she had a fiancé and .
it's very sad .
there's just no excuse for that .
what are they going to do ?
okay i'm done .
great !
nice one .
could you read that out loud for me please ?
i think your book is fabulous because you described it well .
and i love your caterpi i love caterpillars .

that night he had a stomachache .
it's about time .
the next day was sunday again .
the caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf .
and after that he lef felt much better .
now he wasn't hungry anymore .
and he wasn't a little caterpillar anymore .
he was a big .
fat !
caterpillar .
he built a small house called a cocoon around himself .
he stayed inside for more than two weeks .
then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon .
pushed his way out and .
he was a beautiful butterfly !
the end .
looks like he tried to eat through this book too .
thanks chi for doing that .
that's great .
here's the do you remember this the very hungry caterpillar ?
dear eric carle .
your story was very interesting a lot of kids like your story .
chi .
yes .
well we're not going to make you read it this time but we thought .
but you could .
it's like .
whew !
a sigh of relief .
but what we are having all the kids do is write a letter to eric carle who is the author .
of the book !
and we're going to send him the letters .
and he lives in massachusetts .
so we're wondering if you could try to a write a quick letter to him .
don't have to take that long like ten minutes .
okay .
so here's some paper .
that we made .
and here's a pencil .
and we brought the book if you need some .
needta you know refresh your memory .
on how the story goes .
some kids just know it .
you know they have it memorized .
what is his name ?
eric carle .
eric carle .
it's right here .
it's a weird name .
so do you get a little bit did you get a lot of snow ?
no .
just a little .
it's actually it's pretty out .
pretty sick of it .
i'm sick of this stuff .
it's only january .
fifteenth .
i know it .
that's the feeling like my god .
getting sick of the stuff .
dear eric carle .
great .
wait i forgot where i was supposed to put the period .
the comma !
goes after his name .
right .
doesn't look right .
for some reason .
ac tell him if you like the story .
tell him if you didn't like it .
what you did like about it .
okay .
did you guys have a reason for choosing this book ?
i don't kn they chose it a long time ago .
i think they liked it because .
well i don't necessarily know .
i mean i think it's just it's a nice story and there's a lot of things little things you can talk about with it .
it's fun !
you know with the little pages and stuff so .
is this the one where it has all the spots in it ?
i forgot how to spell .
all the all the easy words are hard .
all .
i thought so .
mommy i'm sure you know all the hard words are easy .
chi we can take ten years to do this or we can get it over with .
i don't know .
so let's go .
let me think .
come on now !
no i forgot how to spell .
look at all the easy words .
well i got it right here then .
and right here .
okay .
i'm going to write this letter for you aren't i ?
not .
i hate this coffee pot .
it spills no matter what you do to it .
that's what we have .
the braun ?
i bought it because it was supposed to be one of the best .
but it doesn't even keep the coffee hot .
it definitely keeps it smells like now .
it smells .
and it doesn't keep it that warm .
is that too much for you ?
no it's nice .
i like it in the light .
now you don't remind me .
because when you were in the light .
but you still remind me the way .
jake's mother hair is .
jake's mother's !
hair is .
okay .
well this is the .
that's a pretty common style chi .
it's also the slept on hair .
hat head .
imagine what you must have thought when you saw my fingernails .
chi's mother is a head banger .
the thought did cross my head .
no .
i think it was like .
bride of frankenstein .
i was stenciling it .
it takes it's a lot of time involved in it so .
it's right there .
it's nice .
see up top .
it's pretty .
how did you get up there on a ladder ?
i have a ladder up there so .
it still is .
it's really simple to do but it's just time consuming .
okay .
we may do airplanes in chi's room right ?
yep .
i'm doing it .
still .
i know .
well that's all i have to write because i really don't know much about .
eric carle .
and really if i know about children's authors i would keep on writing and writing him .
do you get to do you do that a lot in school ?
well we actually only give people two pages in the event that they have !
tons to write but you don't have to fill the two pages .
well there's something you should add ?
my name .
how that i hope .
it might be a good idea .
he keeps getting anonymous letters from somebody .
who's writing me and not signing their name ?
so you wouldn't like tea or anything ?
no i'm fine .
me done .
what'd you say ?
dear eric carle your story was very interesting a lot of my kids like your story .

dear mister carl .
my name is chi and i am nine and a half years old .
i was wondering why there is only one character instead of two in the very hungry caterpillar ?
how do you draw and write all of this by your self ?
sincerely , chi .
i do .
the very hungry caterpillar .
mem we've seen some other books like this .
by him too in the store ?
remember ?
i always point them out .
okay .
for my sister christa .
you want me to read it to you really quick ?
can you just look at it ?
so that we .
have something to .
we just want to so we have something intelligent to say .
why d why don't i just read it real qu through quickly okay ?
and you can just look .
or do you want to read it ?
what ?
can you .
remember what it's about ?
tell me .
tell me like as if i never read it before .
it's about a big it's about an egg .
that had it's about an egg .
that grew into a very hungry caterpillar .
egg laid ?
on a leaf .
and then .
and then so the caterpillar .
had ad .
grew and it was very hungry so it ate tons lots of fruits and .
stuff .
you do remember this .
and .
you're telling it in your own words .
but ?
it got even more hungry .
and so it ate real ?
lot of things .
and then it felt sick .
you didn't even read !
it and you know .
so .
then .
so then it had a tummy ache .
so it ate .
and then the next morning he ate some leaves .
what happened when he ate the leaf ?
made him feel better .
he felt much better .
that's terrific !
and he felt .
he was very very fat .
so he cocoon made himself a cocoon and he turned into a butterfly .
i'm impressed !
that's wonderful chi .
beautiful .
beautiful butterfly .
that was a beautiful retelling too .
terrific .
well thank you .
that helped me .
i thought i'd do it quick for you and you did it quick for me .
terrific .
that was the whole thing .
okay .
so let's see .
so the first thing we're going to do is is write .
the date .
right ?
and .
who are you writing to ?
right ?
do you want to write that down ?
it's august twenty third .
what number is august ?
eight .
and ninety five .
i know .
okay .
and .
what's his name ?
i don't know !
dear mr carle ?
or dear eric carle .
mr .
carle .
mr carl winzog .
no .
come on .
put it down .
now is this where you can .
you're you're writing wrong .
salutation ?
you're opening the letter and you're saying you're addressing it .
who are you going to address it to ?
you're writing to the author of the book right ?
so you write .
that's right .
i know .
very good .
don't make that all the way down .
so that .
like that .
comma .
i don't know .
comma .
and then okay so w d what would you like to write to him ?
have you written to an author before in school ?
you have ?
remember the kinds of things .
only in one school .
actually .
and that was just recently .
what d what kind of things did you did you .
find interesting when you did that ?
anything that .
you can think of there that maybe you want to .
that you might want to do here ?
or you want to try something different ?
ask him some different questions ?
i don't know !
okay what did you what would you like to ask him about or talk to him about .
would you like to tell him about the book ?
if you liked it .
if if .
well you don't want to write to him telling him you don't like it if you didn't .
but .
i think you liked it anyway so .
you know what you liked about it or what was interesting or .
how it reminded you of .
you !
eating through those things or anything about it ?
i eat a lot of things except i never get fat .
i get more skinny .
so it reminds you of you except for at the end you don't you don't get fat you just keep growing right ?
and i don't !
turn into a butterfly .
right .
that's true .
and w so you want to tell him about that ?
if i did it would be a pretty big butterfly .
do you want to tell him about that ?
or would you like to .
ask him questions ?
it says by !
eric carle .
and i don't see .
an illustrated by .
so do you think he wrote wrote it all i mean .
drew it also ?
well .
if he made !
it .
that if it was by eric carle .
then .
he must of .
you could ask him .
if it was by eric carle .
then he must of done everything in the book .
especially since there's no other name .
it's by .
that's true .
okay .
well .
that's something you could .
you want to ask him about it ?
any questions ?
because it doesn't look like regular .
crayons or markers does it ?
he drew his face in this one ?
and in this one .
does it you want to ask him about how he did the art work ?
because it almost looks like .
it's painted .
somehow that's .
it's painted here you can tell .
right all of this looks like finger painting .
it's all painted .
but right here .
see how it's like a sharper cut almost looks like something was put on top of it doesn't it ?
it was .
would you be interested in .
it was overlapped .
this is was one paper this is the other paper .
so he he cut out the paintings .
what did he do ?
very good .
see it looks it looks like he's coming out of it .
so what does it do ?
and over this .
so what do you think ?
would you like to ask him about it ?
and how he did that or .
any questions you might have ?
or maybe when he was a kid ?
what gave him ideas ?
do you think when he was a kid he was like you and me and threw everything like that .
or that he was more like you to eat the junk food ?
or more like you to eat the fruits ?
i don't know .
i know .
it's hard to think ?
what do you think you'd like most to know ?
he might of had a caterpillar that ate .
everything .
w that gave him the idea ?
that's a good good point .
you want to ask him .
how he got the idea ?
was it from when he was a kid .
or anything like that ?
he might've had a pet caterpillar that ate everything .
you want to ask him ?
i don't know .
i think that's a good question .
why don't you why don't you start off saying that .
you read his book and .
b for quite a few !
years now .
and .
i only read it ten times .
tell him that then .
say you read the book ten times .
and you you were wondering if .
when he was a kid if he got the idea for the book .
from when he was a child or .
or .
or do you have any c caterpillars when he was a kid ?
or something like that .
why don't you do that ?
he must !
of had a pet caterpillar !
why don't you write the first lines .
opening it saying that you you've enjoyed his book .
or you've read it ten times and you really like it ?
or something like that .
what ideas ?
how could you say something .
in your own !
words ?
just to kind of let him know that you're a a reader of his book .
and that's why you're writing him .
instead of his friend who he he hasn't heard from since third grade .
why don't you say some things out loud what you're thinking in your head .
maybe i can help you .
why did the caterpillar have to eat through everything and then .
and then .
get really fat and then .
make a cocoon and turn into a skinny little butterfly ?
why did it have to ?
why did it have to be a skinny little butterfly ?
because it if if it was so fat .
then how can he how can he s turn into a s little skinny little butterfly ?
he was so fat .
that sounds like a scientific .
you can ask him do that one next .
he built a small house called a cocoon around himself and stayed inside for more than two weeks !
there's a clue .
this caterpillar stayed the cocoon .
for more than two weeks .
for .
a month .
then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon and pushed his way out .
but before .
see what happened .
on monday !
he ate through one apple but he was still hungry .
on tuesday !
he ate two pairs .
on wednesday !
that's everyday isn't it ?
he slept inside these .
well .
on each day he did that so he was eating every single day .
right ?
the fruit .
and then on saturday he ate all !
this .
right ?
and then what happened ?
what did he okay then sunday .
so he was eating every single day of the week .
and then all of a sudden he just grew up fat .
but then what happened ?
did he eat ?
no .
no ?
what happened ?
to his eating s schedule ?
he .
he suddenly .
he didn't eat for two weeks .
that's right .
so maybe that's why he hadta get fat .
so he could store up all the energy because now he was using that his body was using that for two weeks .
to feed itself .
you know ?
as storage food .
so that's probably why .
i thought caterpillars were like .
humans .
that they could eat one like breakfast and then nothing and then they wouldn't be hungry for the rest of the day .
well we we don't hibernate so .
just once a day .
see they do it for two weeks so that's why he needed all that storage .
so that when he came out he was going to be s he didn't eat for two weeks you'd be skinny wouldn't you ?
so at least he's still alive !
you thought i !
didn't eat enough .
so why don't you write that for a sentence .
something about you know who you are and why you're writing to him .
or just like tell him who you are .
introduce yourself .
we we have a hard time writing .
organizing .
so if you want us to s stop let me know because .
no .
go right ahead .
you're doing a good job .
you're doing just fine .
okay .
actually .
intra probably introducing yourself in the first line .
say who you are or .
and .
why you're writing .
dear mr carle .
how about my name .
a good beginning .
i got an idea !
what ?
write my name !
okay .
no .
my name is .
you could say how old you are or what grade you're in .
should i start with a capital or a lower case ?
can you remember ?
it's been awhile .
had a bad last year in school .
try to remember .
how do you begin all sentences ?
but this is .
one .
sentence .
well .
that's .
except it doesn't have a period .
so this would be a lower case .
no .
because it's different because it's a it's a letter .
but no you're this is actually the beginning of a sentence .
okay because this is u like addressing the whole thing and at the end you say .
you know sincerely comma .
chi .
just like that's not a complete sentence .
the same with this .
it's the opening and closing of the letter .
why do i write my name up here ?
well because you're introducing yourself .
it's kind of like saying instead of waiting until the end .
okay .
okay .
and .
that's what the eraser's for .
i haven't wrote something in a long time .
i know .
summer's on .
i know how to spell it .
i know how to spell except i don't know how to write it .
but .
okay .
write write your full first name .
jeez .
draw a line here .
i w wrote my first name since i was my whole entire name since i was .
three .
that's when i got !
my nickname .
okay .
and .
your last name .
remember to make the capitals bigger than the .
the lower cases .
physically bigger ?
so that you can tell the difference .
the only thing that makes it upper or lower case is .
the size .
right .
good .
okay so so what you did so far .
my name is chi .
how about your age ?
and =?
end on .
then we can get it all in one sentence .
n .
i'm sorry to tell you .
i know .
no .
i was going to say that after your name put a comma .
and that would separate it .
that's fine though .
you're doing it good .
are you trying to fit it all on one line .
because you can go on .
how do you spell ?
good .
help .
good .
i'm nine and a half years .
now does that sound like it would be a good place for the period ?
w why don't you read it first .
just to make sure .
dear mr carle .
my name is chi .
and i am nine .
years nine and a half years old .
did that sound like a good place for a period ?
no .
to end it ?
no .
no ?
what did it sound like ?
does it sound like a complete statement a complete sentence ?
no .
let me read it to you .
see how it sounds to you .
or if it sounds like it's it's not finished .
dear mr carle .
my name is chi .
and i am nine and a half years old .
i think that's good .
okay .
and what now .
you've introduced yourself .
and he has an idea who who you are .
what do you want to say to him .
or ask him ?
something about .
more introducing why you're writing to him .
like .
i've read your book since he wrote all these other books too ?
it says in here .
see he wrote .
these other books .
so it might be helpful to him to know what book you're writing about .
you can say i've i've read you book the very hungry caterpillar ?
i c i never learned this !
way .
i never had no .
no ideas .
this is just about publishing .
these are the books you have .
i thought this was about him .
about him ?
no .
it's not .
it is !
about him ?
that would be a good .
let me see .
no .
wait a minute .
no .
but that actually it doesn't have it on this book .
but .
that's a very good idea .
where's the part about him ?
in the future .
if you want to .
write to somebody is read about him .
because that'll be .
very interesting as well as if you're .
interested in writing to him .
you're right that would help .
a lot .
but it doesn't tell about him .
maybe !
that's what you're going to have to write .
ask about him .
say i looked for the paragraph that tells about you but i couldn't find it .
so that ?
you can ask him the questions .
what did he look like ?
i don't know .
good question .
do you think he he played with caterpillars?
when he was little or he liked them ?
does he like scaring people who are afraid of snakes and bugs and stuff ?
is he the type of kid who liked to play with these and .
and then .
and then their mothers came .
and then when the mothers came .
he was holding the snake or caterpillar?
and he said and he put it right in front of her face ?
why don't you ask him ?
how could how could you say that a little bit .
more succinctly ?
w with fewer words like .
that's a .
good question .
try to think of a way that we could say it without it being .
so many words .
but the same question ?
c could try writing that .
and put it on .
that's impossible !
well well think about w what were you getting at ?
what was the point of what you just said .
you wanted to know when .
what ?
did you scare people who were afraid .
of .
s bugs u snakes and bugs ?
or animals .
as an adult !
or as a kid ?
as a kid .
okay .
so make sure you get that in there .
or an adult .
you want to tell him about that you you read this book ?
because i re the other the other books he wrote in here .
they're not all about animals .
so .
or insects .
so .
maybe you want to tell him it's that this is the book that you read ?
and .
after you read it you were wondering .
whether .
how come there's no other characters ?
go ahead .
write it down chi .
get it write it down .
get it put it down .
why is there only one character .
in what ?
he's got all these books .
why is there only one character in the hungry .
caterpillar ?
okay .
do you think you should start a new .
like a new .
paragraph ?
okay how about saying i was wondering or something like that .
instead of just like how come .
kind of kind of abrupt .
you want to kind of .
no .
you don't you don't want him to to like think that you're going what's wrong !
with that book right ?
because that's not what you're doing no how come there isn't .
but you want to say it a little bit .
you want to be make sure that he knows you're being polite and you're not kind of being .
critical right ?
practice with me .
okay go ahead .
no .
i forgot what i would say .
the character one character ?
i was wondering one ?
character .
how about i was wondering why there is only one .
is that okay ?
yup .
course the way you said it was more succinct .
defeats the whole point of what i was saying .
how do you spell ?
what do you think ?
i'll help you if you really need it but try it first because you've been a little bit .
rusty .
from the summer .
excellent .
see that !
excellent !
terrific .
i was wondering .
why is or why .
wait a minute .
i was wondering why .
i was wondering .
why .
why is there .
or .
i was wondering .
why is .
there only one character .
what about i was wondering why there .
is !
only .
switch the ther and ?
what you know you're right because it's why is there but .
alright .
put if you put put a comma .
or a semicolon after .
a what ?
i was wondering .
and then is more if there's more of a pause .
it's it's sort of like .
you're not beginning a new sentence but .
it separates the two ?
it's like you're saying i was wondering .
why is there only .
like that .
what are you going to do ?
i was wondering why .
there why there is only one character .
d do you like the sound of that though ?
because that my my head's doing flips right now .
i can't decide .
so like what you want to do is listen to the sound of it and see how it sounds if it sounds right to you .
or .
i was wondering why .
there .
is .
now do it the other way .
and see .
i was wondering .
i was wondering .
why is .
there .
which one sounds better to you ?
which one .
feels right ?
th first one .
what ?
first one .
okay then .
do it that way .
i was wondering .
why .
there .
is character italian too ?
no .
neither is chi .
he's german .
it's a german .
so it's probably a german .
lo .
a grammar ?
sound .
it's a good point though .
i don't know if originally was from .
a german word or not .
but .
we'll have to learn that another time .
how do you spell ?
okay we have char and then what does it sound like ?
if you're not sure you can ask .
k .
k .
i think the .
and then .
it doesn't always sound the way it looks .
it does sound more .
talk about rusty my .
sorry .
that doesn't mean anything .
okay .
okay .
instead of two !
instead .
of .
two .
instead of two .
wait what did we .
is .
instead of two !
characters .
so an between .
u opposite .
there's not much room you have to erase the .
instead of two .
okay .
okay .
good .
i just want to .
point something out to you .
i obviously he's going to get the letter and it's going to show a picture of his butterfly and caterpillar ?
but .
listen to it .
and what do you think is kind of .
missing .
a little bit .
dear mr carle .
my name is chi .
and i am nine and a half years old .
i was wondering why there is only one character instead of two .
except the caterpillar's the same thing .
he's the same thing .
as the butterfly .
i know but he sees that he'll probably figure out .
but .
what what sounds does something sound funny like something's missing ?
if you would just .
if you were him and you got a letter from somebody that said my name is chi i'm nine and a half years old .
i was wondering why there's only one character instead of two .
would you know what .
chi was talking about ?
which book ?
because remember he wrote all these books .
which book are which book is he talking about i wonder .
do i have to say the ?
name ?
because he wrote all these .
see the honey bee and the robber ?
well obviously that has two characters .
because it's right in the title .
right ?
so he might say well gee .
i have two i have two characters .
i wonder what he means .
so you want to tell him what book you read .
right ?
what your book you're referring to ?
where do i write it though ?
so .
i was wondering why there is only one character instead of two .
in !
your book the very hungry caterpillar ?
in .
the book .
the very the hungry caterpillar .
in your book .
did you say his book ?
in your book .
the hungry caterpillar .
the very .
very hungry caterpillar .
comma .
caterpillar .
instead .
of .
two .
well .
i don't know .
let me see .
i was wondering why .
there's only one character instead of two .
you put .
if you want to leave it you can .
what you d do is read the sentence when you're done and then decide if it sounds like .
you need a .
comma there or not .
in your book .
you're writing the .
you could do it either way .
you could say in the hungry very hungry caterpillar or in your book the very hungry caterpillar .
which ever way you want to do it .
very hungry caterpillar .
okay .
make sure that is big enough right there .
very .
very .
and i think .
i think you underline the title .
is that right .
that is !
underlined .
it is but usually what you i want to do is separate it because it's it's the title of something ?
so it's it's more important .
in in some ways than the rest of the .
the words in the sentence it .
it makes it stand out as something separate .
okay .
now the only question here is that you want a c a period or a .
question mark .
because the way you wrote it you could do it .
either way .
why don't you read it .
and see what it sounds like .
okay .
i was wondering .
why .
there .
is only .
one .
character .
instead of two .
in .
the very .
hungry .
caterpillar .
question .
you want that one .
okay .
okay .
what else do you want .
you know .
you can put a i think you can put a semicolon there ?
and th that would make more sense with the question mark .
what ?
semicolon ?
a dot .
and then .
a comma .
i don't know if it's exactly correct but .
dot and a comma .
because what you want to do is like you kind of separate it .
i was wondering .
and .
then it's almost like you're starting you're starting over again .
why !
is there only and that's a real .
obvious question .
why is there only one .
character is a question .
whereas i was wondering why there is only one character you could you could just put a period there ?
so okay .
then what else do you want to .
write ?
dear mister carle .
my name is chi and i'm nine and a half years old .
i was wondering ?
i was wondering .
why is there only one character instead of two in the very hungry caterpillar ?
i don't know .
do you want to ask him about what when he was a kid ?
that what we were looking for to find out about him when you were looking for the the part that he read wrote about him and stuff .
because like doesn't that look like the this is the paper .
glued together ?
it looks like .
different color cheese .
okay what what do you want to write ?
what do you want to know ?
how did the caterpillar find all the food ?
how did the caterpillar find .
the .
peach and plum .
strawberry and orange and .
well .
do you think that it's really something that .
he needed to .
if you think about it .
obviously he was just looking for it and he probably just found it somewhere .
right ?
i mean if you got into it's really it's a book for .
for younger kids not older kids .
so do you think the younger .
kids are going to be really interested in exactly where he found each food ?
or they just kind of skip that and they're .
interested in you know .
in going through it ?
how about how d how does he decide to what to leave out and what to put in the stories ?
do you want to ask him that ?
like .
like how does he decide to leave out .
the part about where exactly they found the peach and what about these other fruits orange ?
and the fruits .
compared to just you know how did he decide it wasn't important to find out exactly where .
you know what to leave out and what to put in the story ?
is that a question you have ?
because he just started to look for food and then he ate through it .
i'd like to bet that a lot of trees have fruits on them .
well .
is there something you're wondering like what w w how did he make that decision ?
i don't know .
why did .
why h how can .
he find .
the fruits or some .
and stuff .
with .
and .
without like planting them on a tree or something like that ?
the caterpillar ?
that .
that fell from a tree or from a tree or something ?
well .
do you think that it it would he was really the author was really thinking about what .
where he was going to find the food or do you think he was just trying to make it a little bit interesting ?
i mean maybe .
one caterpillar might never find anything but apples .
you know another caterpillar might not find any of these but find something different and that's all they ever eat but .
where he's writing a book .
don't don't you think that he probably wasn't concerned about that part ?
he just skipped that ?
just like in cartoons animals talk .
but they don't in real life ?
but the .
the animator doesn't really think about how did they learn to talk .
they just jump over that .
so that's probably what happened here .
why don't you ask him about when he was little .
if he liked caterpillars or .
what ?
something like that ?
okay ?
how did you make up the story ?
good question .
how about starting with like a new paragraph ?
and indent ?
well .
and you can if you want you can .
try you know erase that indent a little .
you can indent here .
okay ?
i don't want to indent .
how did you get the idea for your stories or .
how did you .
make up the story ?
did you did you like caterpillars when you were little ?
or did your did your mother say you eat too much junk food like my mother says or something like that .
how would you like to say it ?
how could he make up this ?
how could he make !
up this ?
make up a story ?
without and him do it all by himself ?
how can he how could he make up a story by himself ?
you mean where did he get the ideas ?
how could how did how did he make .
the story up .
by himself and do everything in the story by himself .
without help ?
so how did he know what to do once he had the idea .
that what you mean ?
like you have ideas too .
and how did he know to put it into a book and make a .
nice book out of it ?
it's a good question .
how can you say that ?
what would be the way to a ask that in a sentence ?
i don't know .
okay we wrote you want to know about ideas .
what .
how did he make up the story without .
help ?
how did he write out all this stuff and draw .
with all this stuff by himself ?
why don't you write that ?
how did i say it again ?
how did how did .
how did you .
how did he .
how did he write .
and draw all this stuff by himself .
how did you .
write and draw do !
all this .
n indent it a little .
okay good .
is that a statement or a question ?
question .
good .
and you want to ask him about when he was little ?
if he played with .
insects ?
and scared little kids with them or anything ?
no .
or if he ate too much junk food when like you ?
you know what ?
we're going to needta kind of .
go ahead with the the other stuff ?
this is really great .
but maybe .
you can kind of wrap it up .
okay ?
how do you want to end it ?
what do you want to say .
chi ?
do you want to ask one more question ?
no ?
what am i supposed to end it with ?
well .
just like you began it .
you want to end it .
in a similar .
way .
how do you write ?
how about .
let me see .
the very hungry why don't re let me read it to you .
so you'll .
see that it's the whole thing .
okay ?
or you want to read it to me ?
when ?
you finish it ?
dear mr carle .

in the very hungry caterpillar ?
how did you draw and write .
all of this by yourself ?

it works best for you guys .

how about the harvard university .

okay .
chi put the caterpillar must be full of all that junk .
it's true .
it's very true .
he built a small house called a cocoon around himself .
he stayed inside for more than two weeks .
then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon and pushed his way out and .
he was a beautiful butterfly .
he is !
beautiful .
you have to .
put a couple more thoughts down and then finish it off .
so it's a a complete story that you wrote ?
like a complete letter ?
that's what the teachers tell my kids .
that they should elaborate more in their writing ?
it's hard though .
i mean i think it's hard .
kind of .
now put what you what you think or what you like about it or what you don't like .
and this is eric carle .
that's what he looks like ?
this book ?

i look like the book .
because he eats all that stuff .
he was a pretty butterfly .
that's nice .
that's nice .
but there's two -s in .
that was nice .

you did that really quickly !
thanks .
thanks .
well we'll we're going to send that to him .
and .
there's a pencil or a pen .
dear mister carle .
i liked your book the very hungry caterpillar .
i really enjoyed how he ate all the food on saturday because it's all stuff that i like , except swiss cheese .
i also liked how he was small than very big .
next will you write a book called the very hungry butterfly ?
sincerely chi .
you can use whichever one you want .
alright and take about ten minutes maybe .
or however long it takes you while i kind of look through this stuff .
well would you like to .
take a quick look look through the book so it sort of refreshes your memory ?
okay .
you can read it to me and then you can refresh my memory too .
in the light of the moon a l little egg lay .
on a leaf .
on sunday morning the warm sun came up and pop out of the egg came a .
tiny and very hungry caterpillar .
he started to l .
to look for some food .
on monday he ate through one apple but he was still hungry .
on tuesday he ate through two pears but he was still hungry .
on wednesday he ate through three plums but he was still hungry .
on thursday he ate through four strawberries but he was still hungry .
on friday he ate through five oranges but he was still hungry .
on saturday he ate through a piece of chocolate cake .
one icecream cone one pickle one slice of swiss cheese one slice of salami one lollipop .
one piece of cherry pie one sausage one cup cake s a and one slice of watermelon .
that night he .
had a stomachache .
he liked variety ?
the next day was sunday again .
the caterpillar ate through a nice green .
leaf and after that .
he felt much better .
now he wasn't hungry anymore .
and he wasn't a little caterpillar anymore .
he was a big fat caterpillar .
he built a small house called a cocoon around himself .
and stayed inside for more than two weeks .
then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon .
pushed his way out and .
he was a beautiful butterfly .
so what do you really like about that story ?
i liked how he ate through all the stuff like the sausage and the swiss cheese .
isn't it funny it didn't occur to him that if he didn't just eat through it if he ate around and around maybe he wouldn't have been so hungry ?
okay so if you going to write .
a letter to eric carle what would you say about his book ?
i'd say that i really !
liked the part when he ate like the variety of stuff .
is that all stuff that you like ?
what would have been your favorite day ?
i think .
i don't know .
i gotta see what .
day it's in .
apple a pear .
i think maybe .
thursday .
strawberry ?
you don't like strawberries i thought .
well i don't really like them but .
i just like them .
and i also like these pages .
that's saturday .
like sunday !
was thursday .
because on sunday he ate through a leaf .
and on thurs .
no he tay .
or four nibbles out of the .
on thursday he took four .
he made four holes in the .
strawberries .
he kind of did what i tell you to do all the time .
you don't eat you don't grow ?
except that time he grew .
he ate .
i know .
i ate .
so how would you start this letter ?
dear eric .
carle .
or dear mr carle you think ?
okay .
should i write it ?
should i write i really like .
your book the very hungry caterpillar ?
that's a good start .
move in a little for your paragraph ?
remember ?
through ?
have enough light ?
and what do you think you like about it the best ?
i don't know .
i liked saturday the best .
how he ate through all the .
like the swiss cheese .
how he ate through .
how he ate through the .
chocolate cake .
icecream cone .
pickle .
slice of swiss cheese .
salami .
lollipop .
cherry pie .
sausage .
cup cake .
and the slice of watermelon .
i like the way all of a sudden he was very big .
and he wasn't a little caterpillar anymore .
so would you like to do .
would you like to write .
was that your favorite part ?
that you really liked .
the way .
he ate through everything on saturday ?
you liked all !
the things he ate through on saturday ?
okay .
try to think of a way to form it in a sentence .
i liked .
the page where he ate everything on saturday .
okay .
or you can .
alright .
how do you spell ?
think close your eyes visualize .
nope .
almost .
nope .
how do you spell that ?
okay =?
that's it .
how do you spell ?
close your eyes .
that's right .
what do you say are you going to tell me what you're writing ?
i really enjoyed how .
he ate through all the things on saturday .
okay .
what were those things ?
ate through all of the .
like the .
foods .
different food .
well like more ?
junk food .
i guess so .
well sausage isn't a junk food .
sausage .
it's your basic processed meat .
food .
it's not a health food .
if you take a look i would say saturday was a junk food kind of day with the exception of the watermelon .
swiss cheese .
well it's okay .
not good .
but it's okay .
do you think that would give you a stomachache too ?
i don't think so .
not if i poked a little hole through a watermelon .
poked a little hole through a cup cake .
poked a little hole through a sausage , a cherry pie , a lollipop , salami , swiss cheese , pickle .
ice cream cone and chocolate cake .
but you know that you have to remember .
but look at his size !
right ?
well maybe if i was that big .
if i was that big .
you know you have to .
think of things proportionately .
if you were that .
if you were that little !
that's a whole bunch .
well actually if i ate swiss cheese i would get a tummy ache .
why ?
i don't like swiss cheese .
but you like cheese .
cheese doesn't give you a tummy ache .
well we =?
wait .
well did he go to sleep ?
because whenever i eat something and go to sleep i don't feel good .
that's usually only when you go to sleep in the car though .
no .
when i go to .
no ?
well .
only when i go to sleep in the car .
and then you say pull over right now mom !
and he isn't kidding .
so on saturday !
on sunday he ate the green leaf and it made him feel better .
so that was good ?
and he wasn't hungry anymore .
so .
you really enjoyed how he ate all the food on saturday .
because it was such a big variety ?
and it was all stuff that you liked ?
almost all the stuff that i like .
okay well you can you can add that .
that you you enjoyed how he ate all the food on saturday .
because it was all stuff that you like to eat .
except for the swiss cheese .
alright .

that's weird .
in the word .
archeology .
no archeological there are seven vowels and seven consonants .
really ?
it goes consonant .
vowel .
it's a very long word .
it's one of those words that twists my tongue .
consonant vowel consonant vowel .
so .
all stuff that i like except swiss cheese .

punctuation missing here anywhere ?
that's one .
because it's all stuff i like except swiss cheese .

and then they like .

i guess .
so what do you think you would write a book about next ?

well why don't you ask him that ?
or maybe the very full !

you must have studied pretty hard for that .
i studied in one day .
that's all .
well good !

that's good .
hard work pays off ?
sounds like your chest .
a lot of people have upper respiratory difficulties .
chi got over it .
you don't have a .
some books have a cover on it and it will tell you some other books he has written but i don't know if that one does .
well not it would be there it would be on the first pae i before the book starts .
there's a little page .

the honey bee and the .
robber .

watch out .
a giant .
catch the ball .
let'us paint a rainbow .
what's for lunch .
mar m make sure you put periods and commas in there when you needta .
i did .
i did .
okay .
see mom ?
look .
what .
see that ?
make sure your sentences aren't like really long .
do you have a cat ?
no .
really ?
i'm not really good at handwriting .
that's okay .
actually .
you know what sometimes you get a little nervous of the pen because you think i can't make mistakes and you can't erase .
so i should have brought a pencil sorry .
he .
he was evaluated last year .
it tells you where i live too .
and he and and has he like been exercising his quarters .
or he just he'll just come along and .
he exercises and he works with an ot .
that's true .
mine is .
sound meaning her hand writing is bad .
mine's terrible too .
i'm glad .
especially when i take notes in school i try to read them over and i .
say .
should i should i say my favorite part in the book or .
it's your letter .
okay .
okay ?
why d why don't tell him .
i forget .
how do you spell .
how do spell ?
okay .
fav .
or .
it .
sound it out .
ma !
chi i'm not going to be behind you all day when you go back to school .
well the teacher tells us how to spell .
you gotta sound things out .
you want more what ?
got you gotcha .
because this is like .
it's just not him .
there's a lot of kids .
they have a new phonetic way of approaching things .
they don't .
in his school it just seems like they don't address things to kids like in the first or second grade they didn't address long short short ay .
sounds ?
so it's harder to detect .
right .
like a a soft and .
so i think he has a real hard time with that .
when he eats the junk food .
when he eats the junk food .
right !
all the things you're not supposed to eat .
i don't really believe in stigmatizing labels and stuff but .
is that how you spell ?
what ?
is that how you spell ?
but then the whole word goes together .
so what you should do is put a hyphen !
there .
hyphen right here ?
so you know the whole word goes together .
sorry .
i did a core .
for first grade .
it comes back .
everything's normal within normal limits .
and i just didn't see it because i could see he was struggling and having difficulties .
and then i did an evaluation on my own .
it took some time because it takes so long to get an appointment .
and now !
i just had a team meeting with his third grade teachers who said to me .
you know .
he's awfully fidgety .
he can't keep still .
he's having a hard time being focused .
it's like i have to literally talk to him all the time .
well i says excuse me .
but are you aware .
that he has add ?
she wasn't aware of it .
so i told this teacher i i told the teacher in his the team .
i said excuse me but i think this is an administrative issue .
i said i clearly had it diagnosed .
and i said this is obviously .
a miscommunication here .
because she was like saying to me .
how irritated she was with it .
and she obviously doesn't have a kno lot of knowledge to it .
right .
and and if you are more se you'd be more sensitive !
to it .
so let's see what you write chi .
i like your illustrations in your books like the very hungry caterpillar .
catch the ball .
watch out .
a giant .
my favorite part is when he eats the food and gets a stomachache .
good .
how did you sign it ?
from first and last name .
great .
and the first task that i'd like you to do is a letter writing task .
dear eric carle .
i would like to tell you i loved your story the very hungry caterpillar .
it's one of my favorite books .
i have enjoyed it since i was in preschool but now i am in fourth grade .
my favorite part of the story was when the caterpillar turned into a butterfly .
i liked that part because i think that it was the most exciting part .
by chi and mot .
and .
sometimes after reading a book people write to the author .
and i know that you've read the very hungry caterpillar .
by eric carle .
and i'd like you and your mom .
to write a letter to eric carle .
about his book .
and we have his home address .

to .
write a letter .
to h .
you can do it together .
before .
you can start .

you like his books .
don't you ?
don't you ?
write whatever you want on it .
it could be something you know .
i like .
your book or i didn't like your book or i liked your colors or .
something about yourself .
and give us a piece of paper and a pen or pencil .
what would rather to use ?
pencil would be better for him .
okay .
you can look at the book and then decide what you want to write .
or you don't have to do that either .
write him a letter ?
that way he can get the letter and .
maybe you'll hear from him ?
who knows ?
it doesn't we give you two sheets of paper but you don't have to use all the two sheets .
we just give people in case !
they wanted to write a lot but .
just write as much as you feel you need .
the pictures are pretty .
you tell him .
you tell him .
do you want to look at the book first ?
no ?
well it might be easier then if you put the paper on that on the table .
put the book like this .
put the book like this !
can you write about it .
tell them what you'd like about the picture .
the book !
what do you like about the book ?
what do you like about the caterpillar ?
he's long and big and green .
you don't want to do it ?
it's easy chi .
well you know what why don't we do .
something else first ?
how's that ?
we'll make it easier .
so you don't have to do it .
want me to help you ?
chi ?
nickname ?
want m mama to help you ?
it only takes two seconds .

chi .
do you want to write with a pen or a pencil ?

here you go there's a pencil .
it's only if they want to .
come on .
come on .
no .
i mean i don't .
the book is there only if you want to use it .
then .
so this is what i'm saying because usually he writes it and .
i look at it to see if the spelling is right .
that's how we usually do it .
okay .
you should .
write more this way „ ?
looks like he got a good eraser .
you liked the cricket .
every time we used to go over to to the .
library .
we'd go for these books .
he has written a lot !
and we'd always take them home .
and then .
doesn't he have any other ones out ?
he has got the cricket and he has got this one out .
and .
isn't there's another ?
there's three i think .
that ?

go on what else ?
i like the .
what ?
what's that supposed to be ?

sincerely first and last name .
very nice !
i like that !
well the first thing i'd like you and your mom to do is .
dear mister eric carle .
i like your book called a very hungry caterpillar .
it was funny the way the caterpillar ate more and more food as the days went on .
i also liked how the caterpillar got bigger after he ate all the food and when he grew bigger he got sick .
it was sad that the caterpillar got sick but it was on him because he ate so much .
i enjoy reading your book .
sincerely , chi .
you know sometimes after .
actually this may seem a little .
young for you because really we did this we didn't visit you in ninety three .
i think there were like i w there was bad weather and whatever it got canceled .
so this was really things that we had kids do like two years ago ?
but if you could just humor me and do this it would be it would be helpful .
okay ?
but you know sometimes after having read a book people write to the author ?
and i know that you've read this book .
does that look familiar ?
the very hungry caterpillar by eric carle .
and i'd like you and your mom to write .
him to write a letter to eric carle .
and what we're going to do is we have his home address and we're going to send all the letters that the kids have written who are in the study we're going to send them to mr carle and .
here's some paper .
you don't have to use all of it but that's there's just an extra sheet if you n need it .
look at that and you guys can do that together and just take about ten ten minutes .
excuse me .
now you want us to write about the book ?
well .
about how we enjoyed the book ?
you can write whatever you want .
it's just a letter to to him and anything .
anything that you guys want to put in it is is great is fine .
okay .
it's really up to you .
okay .
you want to read it or you want me to read it so you remember ?
you can read it .
okay .
well it starts off with do you remember for my sister christa .
i loved all the pictures all the time .
in the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf .
here's the moon here's the leaf .
okay you see the moon and the leaf ?
this is what i used to do when you were little where's the moon ?
where's the leaf ?
where's the little egg ?
on sunday morning the warm sun came up .
and pop out of the egg come a tiny and very hungry caterpillar .
he started to look for some food .
on monday he ate through an apple but he was still hungry .
on tuesday he ate through two pears but he was still hungry .
on wednesday he ate through three plums but he was still !
hungry .
on thursday he ate through four strawberries but he was still !
hungry .
on friday he ate through five oranges .
but he was still !
hungry .
on saturday he ate through one piece of chocolate cake one ice cream cone one pickle one slice of swiss cheese one slice of salami one lollipop one piece of cherry pie one sausage one cupcake and one slice of watermelon .
that night he had a stomachache .
the next day was sunday again .
the caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf and after that he felt much better .
now he wasn't hungry anymore and he and he wasn't a little caterpillar anymore .
he was a big fat caterpillar .
he built a small house .
called a cocoon around himself .
he stayed inside for more than two weeks .
then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon pushed his way out and .
he was a beautiful butterfly .
so what do you think ?
well did you like the story ?
why ?
i'll write it .
i'll write it .
okay .
i like it because after he ate all that junk food !
that he shouldn't of eaten .
well some of it's good for you but not to eat it all at one time .
then he ate the leaf !
that's .
nutritious for you he felt better .
maybe he'll think about that next time he wants to eat all of those things at once .
i mean .
there's nothing wrong with an icecream cone and cake and watermelon .
but to eat it all at one time ?
i don't think i'd want to try it .
now how far along do you do you study the children ?
well .
we're waiting right now to hear about more funding ?
so if we don't get that this this visit will probably be the last one .
but if we do we you know we'd like to continue as long as we could .
it depends .
so it all depends on a year to year thing .
right .
i see .
exactly .
so we'd love to see how they're doing in middle school .
all set ?
gosh that was .
quick chi .
can you read can you read to me what you wrote ?
thanks .
dear msiter eric carle .
i like your book called a very hungry caterpillar .

i would think his fingers would so sore .
they probably do .
they get sore after an hour .
i told you .
i've been telling you for years you don't have to press so hard .
i read your book .
there should probably be a comma after i read your book .
i think .
what's a good adjective for his book ?

say something nice .
he can say that .
it's his letter .
well maybe i think it's fun to read ?

now talk about the butterfly for a second .
the butterfly was really colorful .
or say something like .
there you go .
i wonder why they call them .
butterflies butterflies because they're not made out of butter .

wishful thinking ?
why do you think it's sticking to everything ?
because it's magnetic .
can you .
join him or .
can you join him please ?
who ?
me ?
we'd like the two of you to play together .

and talk about it whatever .
what ?
how come ?

sorry !
wherever it goes nobody knows .
think you can get it .
to land on a certain spot ?
who has got the power ?
you or the stick ?

why ?
because .
it has lots of magnetic force .
i want to see if it's .
can you break the magnetic force ?
yes .
how ?
watch .
what are they doing ?
i don't know .
do they like each other ?

see if they still stick .
this sticks .
do they stick ?
i didn't think they would .
i don't know how to break the force .
look how loud cousin ?
see ?
i can break the force .
does your hand break it ?
see ?
that's cool .
you're making it move .
mr magico .
can i keep this and give it to you tomorrow ?
right !
get away from me !

if we were magnets .
and if little people were magnets and the big people weren't .
like say black base isn't a magnet and wand is .
wand is the little person .
one .
look .
i made you fall .
haha !
we'd be picking on them .
the world would be a different place ?

it's standing up right now but .
right .
look .

mom .
it if you do it this way yellow wand will not like pushes !
black base down .
if you turn yellow wand the other way yellow wand sticks immediately .
guys !
on that of yellow wand .
ma !
if both of yellow wand are magnetized .
see i don't know anything about attraction and repulsion capabilities of the yellow wand .
take a break !
say .
see i don't know why that what the principle is .
mom !
watch this .
a a vacuum cleaner .
does this small rectangular piece got a magnet on it ?
try that small rectangular piece .

blue ball and yellow wand does push away .
cool .
let's do this .
sticks .

l let's try this of the yellow wand .
this of the yellow wand can't do pick up the nut from the black base .
let's try the other of the yellow wand .
maybe because you tapped black base ?
no .
look watch .
referent unclear .

this of the yellow wand .
watch .
see ?
one of those red ball is under black base .
i'll try the .
i'll .
just go like this .

cool .
nut runs away from me .
so does this black base .
bro .
do you want to .

this is frustrating .
come on !
get off i say .

w what do you mean ?
see nut could still .
even through the penny nut still like .
sticks a little bit .
let's try two pennies .
look at you picking up all that stuff .
my god !
you can feel magnetic force pulling on the nut with two pennies .
feel .
do you think it's it is is magnetic force pulling through the penny or is force just .
get off i say .
do you feel magnetic force just from the other side ?
get off !
strong .
i can't tell .
everything ?
throw bro magnets at bro .
see if magnets sticks .

purple side of the purple magnet .
see .
here's the magnet .
i'm =?

whatever purple star is .
see ?
stick sticks both ways .
that way .
is purple star a magnet ?
this purple star .
two flat triangles a magnet ?

it means like push it back .
that'referent unclear weird .
i can't tell .
if .
chi can i have yellow wand ?
but look th penny will not stick .
pennies pennies don't .
aren't attracted to magnets .
i'm going to scoop i'm going to scoop everything metal n .
then up onto the yellow wand .
except the pennies .
shoot .
so just certain kinds of metal because pennies are made of metal but .

this .
well i remember i remember magnets !
base magnet is strong .
now do you remember thmagnets ?
i m i remember referent unclear kept taking my hand .
i was little then .

magnets is powerful stuff .
this one = flat silver circle lying on the black base is .
very powerful .

yellow wand is yellow wand is a magnet .
too .
i know .
cool .
look at the the .
see he'washer attached to silver man doing a trick .
what are these referent unclear supposed to be ?
look at the paper clip .
when you do move the wand back and forth .
wait .
referent unclear must be referent unclear must be going through the that wire = referent unclear down there .
nope .
referent unclear what ?
ow .
why is base magnet so strong ?
wonder who invented this thing = magnets ?
i'd be surprised if you could get referent unclear off .
say can .
easy to clean up ?
that's true .
he'orange man does she stick ?
say can .
watch this .
watch this mom .
yellow wand moves the ball like .
red ball it went for yellow wand .
it le .
it'referent unclear like striking .
i know what yellow wand is for .
yellow wand is the stack them up .
there goes the washer .
this one'flat silver circle lying on base stronger .
that's why .
let's see silver man do a dance .
and do the dance .
no wait .
they'magnets striking .
and get that easy .
i i know what purple star is mom .
i know what it'purple star for .
what ?
you try to take magnets in the pile all off without dropping pile of magnets .
you mean you put magnets in the pile all on top of each other ?
no you try to take magnets in the pile off without making the s tower fall .
let's try that .
i don't know what you mean .
you know you try to take the silver men and stick .
these silver men ?
the magnets off .
and everything off without making pile of magnets fall .
let's see .
watch .
when you put some of nuts on it makes purple star .
no i guess it'purple star not doing it .
that's why you can't put magnets on with purple star .
and when you .
i .
the power is going out of purple star .
i okay who's going first ?
who's going first ?
this purple star repels .
th nothing will go on that star .
get on here .
do you now can you remember magnets activity mom ?
no .
i don't remember activity .
look .
who's going first ?
you or me mom ?
what do you mean ?
you go ahead .
i don't know what you're talking about so .
we're playing a game .
i'll teach you .
i will teach you .
watch .
paper clip goes flying .
okay i'll stack thmagnets .
okay we'll play the game stack them .
who's going first ?
you'll have to because i don't know what you're talking about .
stack them .
now it's it's your idea .
okay .
stack just the silver men .
no .
i meant with yellow wand .
who goes first ?
what do you mean ?
go .
you go first .
take .
a silver man .
he'silver man not going to go on base without you .
grab ?
silver man mom .
it'base repeling against silver man .
okay get up there .
okay .
whatever way washers hits washers stays that way .
i thought you weren't supposed to use your hands ?
i will not .
you can just move magnets on the yellow wand .
i see .
just on this yellow wand you see ?
rules change as you get it gets more difficult right ?
watch .
see ?
okay .
you stack everything up and i'll show you what i mean .
stack magnets up on base magnet ?
yup .
okay .
everything not just the silver men .
just everything .
nineteen ninety four olympic games .
everything .
stack everything .
now try to take silver men down without knocking them down .
the stack the tower down .
what are silver men holding the olympic circles or something ?
say .
that'nut going to i might i think nut might knock tower of silver men even down .
i know .
well .
let's see which one'yellow wand and base more stronger .
okay i'll help you stack thmagnets up .
first goes .
that is there another silver stick ?
yup right next to me .
second silver stick goes here and first silver stick goes here .
and we gotta try to balance the ball .
like this .
balance the ball .
then you try to put thmagnets in a stack .
a tower mom .
london .
this the this this yellow ball is a magnet .
i know .
i'll get it .
watch this .
you know like he's going towards the referent unclear .
and he hasta hold silver stick .
all the silver men on silver stick .
think ?
silver stick the surface ?
and if silver men fall off they're dead .
how did you know ?
i know everything .
is there any other silver men ?
nope .
okay wait .
okay .
silver man holds an olympic .
now it'tower of magnets .
get get everything off here because when i go to grab referent unclear i know it'tower going to fall down .
i got an even better idea .
like he'silver man a real guy and it'silver stick probably going to break his every bone in his body .
you can put silver man on top .
it's like the circus .
i'm going to make my own circus .
watch .
if configuration of silver men and sticks could happen in real life this would be the most amazing thing in the whole .
world .
time for bed .
just stack thmagnets in a tower and then we'll .
okay .
no .
just don't make the silver men on top of the people .
three people .
you have the right idea chi .
see what you do .
you have to make everything in one tower .
you go like this .
then put one of silver stick .
can't get silver stick off base .
that .
silver man can balance on silver stick .
no silver man can go upside down .
okay silver man can go upside down .
because the head will be holding silver man up .
where's the other silver man ?
no more silver men ?
there silver stick is .
what ?
let's see .
if we can get this silver man off .
wrong way wrong way .
and then ?
the ball in the middle ?
where referent unclear goes ?
know what i was wondering what could happen ?
the ball would just float in the air ?
it'red ball not going to go on there .
if the ball would just froat float in the air like .
balls really are floating .
okay .
what am i trying to do here ?
mom i can't .
that'tower of magnets neat .
tadah .
green triangle will not work .
what the .
yellow ball will not work .
nope .
i was hoping it would .
referent unclear just likes .
referent unclear just likes float around .
well that was pretty cool chi .
now the hard part .
you're doing magnet at a time ?
nice .
so far you got one point .
because now you get my game ?
kind of .
not really .
a little bit .
working .
that'silver stick going to be hard .
yep .
lift up on silver stick .
then silver stick would come .
i'm in .
watch this .
watch this .
there you go .
he'silver man playing tug of war .
it's your turn .
you got two points .
okay .
okay we have to set magnet tower up a completely different way .
well you know what sir i'm running low on .
batteries .

alright .
looks like something you'd see at the science museum .
i don't feel like making this .
feel how strong that is .
want to make silver ball move ?

plastic magnet balls must be magnets inside ?
yep .
a metal detector .
you still have more ?
i don't want to see that nickel going in your pocket now .
we're saving for florida .

the ball moves ?
cool !
maybe glass is a little thick .
what about this silver ball ?
watch .
it will not work .
look at red plastic ball !

watch .
how close does black base have to .
i want to try something .
where you going ?
getting something .
do you know what ?
how come you took the good horseshoe magnet with you ?
because i need it .
simple science ?
they show the magnet thing in here ?
unless you're going to play with it .
what does it say ?
i don't know .
is he .
he'goofy not trying to pick up the sandwich is he ?
yes .
he'goofy trying to pick up the sandwich .
this book does book tell you how magnets work ?
or why magnets work ?
look book characters have a paper clip too .
up here .
hold your magnet several inches away from the paper clip .
slowly move it closer .
until .
snap !
paper clip jumps over to the magnet .
cool .
okay .
i want to try this referent unclear .
it works .
works with the safety pin too .
it's easy ?
watch .
try and pull it away .
i can't pull it away !
almost .
here it goes .
a magnet will pick up something made of iron or steel .
get that .
it ran away from me .
where's the other the little horseshoe one ?
i don't have it ?

thank you .
i want to look at the =?
another picture .
what you going to do with any of this ?
this like you know .
silver men little men .
you can take all that objects in the plastic box of the box .
what type of a it'black base like a big magnet .
right ?
i think that i might have given it to you upside down .
i think black base might be upside down .
then black base might .
not that side of the black base makes a huge difference .
it does make a huge difference .
there you go .
very powerful ?
what is inside of box which contained the silver men .
that'standing silver man kind of cute .
you think you're holding a basketball .
the basketball hoop .
like what ?
here this is .
take that silver men sitting on the black base .
leave that silver men sitting there on our basketball arena .
any ideas ?
no .
this is where you shoot from .
magnets is very powerful .
i don't i don't know what magnet set is all about .
i'm not sure .
you can build things with magnet set .
you could play hockey .
like this .
it's standing up on its head doing entertainment .
okay wait .
let me put a silver man to stand up .
let me fix it .
there's not much to =?
i've had enough of this magnets .
what's yellow wand ?
let me see .
he'a silver man standing .
doing a cartwheel .
i know .
well that can red lego piece does not magnetic .
red lego piece is not magnetic .
now referent unclear is .
look at box .
and it objects belongs together ?
look at probably a picture on the box .
let's try to make the construction pictured on the box .
it all belongs together .
and go like this .
so .
we can make a .
should put some of this .
okay .
so we make silver men stand up .
like this .
here's .
and stand up like that .
very powerful black base here .
wait wait mom .
see .
let me see .
this'silver stick stand up on top of third silver man .
something like another silver stick .
no .
here .
no .
it'nut's too heavy .
too heavy .
too heavy .
that'silver man and stick structure a nice thing that we made right here .
wonder what flat red lego pieces stuck together is for .
i know you could take it out = take it apart .
i can make .
i want another silver man .
on top of the silver man and stick structure .
that'silver man tower cute .
there tower goes !
it'tower too heavy .
the weight .
we can make a weight .
on there .
wait mommy .
flat round checkerboard magnet doesn't do nothing .
what this what referent unclear is for ?
what ?
he'silver man going to fall off .
catch on to yellow wand .
you could see that yellow wand .
can have many effects .
feel magnetic force as the wand nears magnetic objects or the black base .
feel that .
and you'll see the strength of yellow wand .
go slowly and you'll see .
slowly .
then you can put yellow wand on .
then you can put yellow wand on .
see ?
is that enough ?
sure .
that's fine .
let's see .
what do we have here .
there you go .
what is this ?
magnet set !
i love acrobats !
i have magnet set !
like the .
yes i have this exact magnet set .
with the little silver men too .
so like what's our motive ?
just to play with magnet set ?
that's it .
okay .
wrong way .
referent unclear is the way it'magnet set supposed to be .
attachable .
don't tell me where it'referent unclear supposed to be .
no .
i was just showing you which way !
black base was supposed to be .
silver circle on black base , maybe is the magnetic field .
sorry .
it's alright .
we have a yellow wand too .
chi learned a valuable thing about these .
kind of wands when he was young .
you can't put them near anything like taperecorder maybe right ?
right .
and like the .
or the video .
we have .
we still have a permanent a little .
sorry !
stain on our picture screen .
really ?
it was years ago and at least the bright color has faded .
i'm sorry mom .
i'm going to have to put taperecorder way over away from the magnets .
i'll just put taperecorder over away from the magnets .
no i don't think it's it's .
as long as you don't put taperecorder up to yellow wand .
it'yellow wand not strong enough to cause any damage .
great mom .
great mom .
look .
why don't you just put taperecorder right there .
why don't you just lay referent unclear on top !
silver men that fell is presumed dead .
silver man that fell can carry this a nut .
ha !
watch .
look at that !
referent unclear don't have very many wands .
why ?
nice mom .
trying .
no .
you know .
i know what i'm trying to do !
now in california .
major earthquakes are still occurring .
two silver sticks .
you're wondering about the san andreas fault ?
now watch .
here watch .
if you take .
two normal silver men .
normal silver men ?
something without a l lug nut or whatever you call these nuts and washers ?
now go like this .
here .
now you go .
this .
like this .
i'll do this .
that way i can see chi working with the magnets .
because i'm very interested in what you're doing on the table with the magnets .
like this .
this .
want a pillow or something ?
no .
cool ?
now you go .
this .
yes .
very complex .
mind if i take this mot's structure of one silver man and four nuts and washers apart for a second ?
fine .
go ahead .
and now go .
watch out mommy .
tadah !
cool chi !
now .
what if we .
don't do it .
don't do it !
fine mom .
mom .
squiggly !
great mom .
perfect .
that's referent unclear .
we're playing tarklands .
there you go .
how about duke a them mom ?
dad ?
likes to play horseshoes .
i hate magnets .
having troubles ?
i am too !
i guess you're having a bit more fun than i !
am even .
what happens if you take flat silver circle the black base ?
great mom .
you just took the electromagnetic field off .
did i ?
unhunh .
no it'magnetic field in black base .
flat silver circle made a force actually .
i bet you we can still do make things stand , attach , etc.
on black base .
i know !
the greatest thing .
different .
isn't base without the flat circle ?
it is .
sort of need the .
magnetic .
why do you need flat silver circle ?
because .
perhaps the magnetic force of the black base can only relate .
see !
silver man wants to be like standing up maybe .
but on black base , without the flat circle .
but why ?
why ?
why does having flat silver circle !
on black base !
make these silver men stand up ?
because it'flace silver circle relating to black base and flat silver circle makes the magnetic field sort of less .
so now you can go like .
wait .
it'flat silver circle upside down now .
isn't flat silver circle ?
no .
no .
there isn't an upside down .
then we'll have flat circle the the way i picked it .
and !
watch and learn mom .
watch .
okay .
watch .
but why ?
does flat silver circle .
disperse the .
field ?
because i never tried it without that .
metal flat silver circle before .
it's because i didn't detach flat circle .
they'flat silver circle like .
sort of crazy glued onto the base .
now watch this okay ?
great .
what did you make ?
having troubles ?
how about this thin , round , flat magnet ?
what's thin , round , flat magnet ?
it'thin , round magnet a magnet .
it'thin , round magnet a little skinny one .
well good .
now watch .
may i take your .
fine .
watch !
watch !
yes chi .
whatever chi .
that makes referent unclear .
tadah !
much different doesn't referent unclear ?
we just like .
okay mot .
but what are you trying to do ?
very little =?
right in the middle = middle of the silver sticks .
i've got a lot of these silver men .
in my room .
really works .
you're not restricted to what's on the table .
you want to get more silver men ?
and just just .
sure .
i'll count how silver men are on the table so .
you can put videocamera on pause if you want or whatever .
no i'll let your mom play with magnet set .
now she can finally have access to magnet set without you .
right .
he'll keep you amused .
it's true .
we tried to make magnets do all kinds of things too .
they'magnets fun .
i meant to count silver men .
we have two guys three guys four guys five silver men on the table .
great mom .
modern art .
modern art .
i'll give you modern art .
she'll give me modern art .
tadah !
okay .
this omni theatre effect .
i better stop it i better stop my zooming in and zooming out .
they're going to be mad at me when they look at the tape .
they don't like it when i do in and out with the camera .
get creative with .
here mom .
chi !
boy !
you can tell which one'of the black bases yours !
you can .
that'black base exactly the same same as exp's base though .
great mom .
now we can hardly tell two black bases apart except for the smudges .
that's alright .
want to try something mom ?
that's good .
yours have smudges .
well yes that's what we're here for .
okay .
i'm going to have to destroy mot's arrangement of magnets .
fine .
what is it that you're going to do ?
you'll see .
well can i help ?
fine .
you you can help !
just going to have to make a square of silver men on his black base .
no silver sticks because it'll wreck the format i guess .
now !
go like this .
tadah !
very good !
i like chi's structure .
it'chi's structure like a little .
plaza .
but we don't have another another flat silver circle to make another tier .
too bad .
we can use these little .
silver sticks .
fine .
i have three silver sticks of mine .
fine .
i have silver sticks here .
it'referent unclear not going to stand up .
watch .
what is it you want to do ?
well .
it'structure supposed to go like .
well how .
there there's rules about making the structure ?
no .
there isn't .
stop laughing .
sorry .
mom you're supposed to .
supposed to ?
you mean you'd like to do something .
no no .
i mean .
the way it's going to have to make structure .
mom !
gosh .
you just killed the little silver man .
mom !
chi what is your problem ?
what's your problem ?
i don't have a problem .
i'm just putting the magnets on the second level flat silver circle .
yes .
very good .
chi .
okay .
just tell me what you're trying to do and i will not get .
thank you !
in your way .
good !
good .
i am trying !
to make another .

will you allow me ?
yes .
thank you mom .
what ?

i will not do anything .
to get in your way .
watch .
watch .
i had a different thing to do .
do yours first .
thank you .
and then you can wreck mine .
okay .
i see .
that'chi's structure very good .
maybe i should .
he'silver man which fell too close to the of flat silver circle .
no .
it's = silver man which fell close to the of flat silver circle .
no he'silver man .
that why he'silver man flipping down .
he'silver man trying to go toward the black base .
now i can go like this .
take two new silver sticks .
would you like some background music on mom ?
anything .
that's okay .
look at red ball , chi's pyramid structure .
just a second .
on the of the tower .
you're not done yet .
no i'm not .
now !
chi .
but i don't think it'placing the red ball on top going to work now with top silver man .
we'll have to give top silver man something else .
put hsilver man back on top of the tower .
i'm .
what ?
i don't know .
i'm sorry .
tower was very impressive .
now if your wanting to get .
fallen silver man is just a victim !
more silver men for his magnet set .
he'referent unclear really boring .
fallen silver man is the rotting corpse !
silver man was brutally attacked and pushed off a building .
earthquake .
if you say so .
fine .
you made falling of the tower happen .
sure .
boy that was pretty .
you can fool around for a second .
i'm just going to put on some music .
well .
if we put on music that might cause a little problem with the sound .
would putting on the music .
interfere with your .
sound system or whatever ?
well i think we're just about done .
so you can do whatever you'd like .
if you want to add some sound to it .
fine .
any sort of selection you want ?
instrumental .
it's called the planets .
i'm going to turn video camera off .
so you can do whatever you'd like with magnets and say whatever you want .
it yellow wand just will not pick up .
i'll make nut move and nut wants to go onto the base .
come on .
little silver men .
probably will pick up thin magnets .
well they'washers sure attractive .
that's cool .
my .
w we had a accident ?
daddy keep thwashers up .
keep them up .
up .
up .
up .
what are you doing ?
sol no .
sol no .
okay .
daddy can i do hold the yellow wand ?
no you can't .
one .
two .
there's some of like forces there so maybe they don't they don't attract .
thank you .
see the force that can move this thin circle magnet around .
wand can move this red ball too .
we have an act here .
we have a what here ?
an act .
an act .
this is your .
circus act ?
look .
where did referent unclear go ?
daddy daddy we need some attracting here .

daddy put silver man up front right on top of the washer tower .
okay .
i have to get up on a flat surface .
there .
i want tower right a certain place on the black base .
that will keep thmaybe parts of the tower together .
like that .
i can keep tower standing like with a washer leaned against the base .
now you have a try .
you try daddy .
look !
daddy .
right here .
thank you .
sure .
excuse me .
steel will not attract silver man steel .
steel will not attract steel ?
like forces will not attract .
they have the same .
impossible .
take another nut on the base .
my friend let's go boogie .
look chi .
okay .
tadah .
tadah you got silver stick with the nut on top to stay .
you should try and get the purple star magnet on and see .
the star .
you think the star's still coming ?
for referent unclear ?
phooey .
i'm going to try to get both nuts on silver stick .
one .
and don't move on me .
meow .
i wonder if paper clip will magnet .
what what did you ask ?
i was was wondering if paper clip would go on with top of the silver stick and nut .
it paper clip did .
and you add two paper clips .
paper clip maybe wants to stay .
i guess they'paper clips afraid of heights .
there's a force in the magnet .
a like force and unlike forces .
one will attract .
one will repel .
i'll make i'll make you a ballerina now .
let go .
boogie .
a boogie .
there we go .
stay ?
daddy we need that magne that magnetic force field over over the tower of silver men .
see like forces chi .
watch what like forces do .
like forces repel .
like forces don't want to come together .
so its a strong force right between the ball and the wand .
they'd like to run away .
see ?
wand and ball don't want to stay together .
it'force between ball and wand the same force .
if you turn yellow wand on the other side wand and ball attract .
come together .
now you can push red ball away because it's the same force .
that'repulsion cool .
after all that hard work !

on a nut on the black base .
you know what ?
what ?
i'm knocking down everything .
the construction .
okay ?
nut maybe goes .
wait .
here ?
that nut doesn't go on a silver man .
why don't you try this .
and have something on there =?
it ?
i have these .
little yellow magnetic ball .
i don't think they'magnet balls stay up on silver stick but maybe we can do this .
there ?
like that .
yellow magnet ball stayed .
i can't believe that'yellow magnet ball staying up on silver stick .
try the other magnet ball buddy .
isn't there another ball ?
maybe that maroon magnet ball would work better .
of course not .
thought you were knocking down everything else .
can't believe that one'yellow magnet ball staying up there .
that's because it'yellow magnet ball on the side .
a little .
here you go .
now i want to see if we can fix this remainder of construction .
how dare maroon ball maybe fall .
i know .
let's just use washers .

i'm going to turn it to something else .
let's take off magnets on the black base .
going to make something else .
nuts off .

and feel the pressure .
can you feel force ?
you can !
hold silver stick with your hands .
hold it like this and you can .
this mot's washer here doesn't do that = isn't repelled .
but that silver stick does .
try to put silver stick onto the black base .
can you feel repulsion between black base and silver stick ?
can you feel silver stick moving = being repelled by the base ?
penny will not stick .
nope .
here chi .
see .
mom .
it'orange man's too heavy .
look at this one purple star magnet chi .
this one purple star magnet with a silver man on top of it will not .
there's another nut .
see if you can stand washers up like on its side on top of your tower .
like the bigger nuts and bolts .
put them like this one .
see if you can do make a tower of washers .
another nut !
you like .
magnets ?
tower of nuts was your best one .
look at tower of nuts !

we can make hanging washer move .
i'm building a box .
i'm building a box .
neat .
where's my muscles ?
mother dear ain't got no muscles .
about right now chi would be taking a tantrum and throwing them .
let's put washer down on this unfinished side of the cube here .
this unfinished side of the cube .
i'm going to put another one .
we'll put silver man on the unfinished side of the cube .
no ?
will not work .
no ?
okay .
poke my eyes .
let's make a .
bridge .
let us take tower of nuts one down .
don't take objects on black base all down .
and you know what we'll do ?
we'll put one of silver stick through hole in nut .
like this .
like this here .
and so ?
nut .
put nut one on black base .
and nut one over on black base , next to the first nut .
and put nut in the in between the other two nuts so .

yep .
awesome !
pretty nice isn't it ?
i thought bridge was going to go down .
let me see if i can in on bridge .
maybe that one .
maybe those nuts are too heavy .
why don't you try washers ?
or try silver stick .
the top of the bridge .
try that silver stick .
removing objects from the black base will build the muscles .
scarecrow .
scarecrow ?
see how nut went right down ?
put silver man up on the of the tower .
like king of the hill .
these thin refrigerator-type magnet stick ?
these thin refrigerator-type magnets stick too .

that of the base don't work .
look at that !
here you go .
it'silver man at the bottom of the chain of objects which are attached to the silver bowl picking up .
silver stick , a washer , and two balls from the table .
because once object hits the magnet .
object becomes magnetic .
didn't you know that objects become magnetic when they touch magnets ?
crane .
try red ball .
i didn't know there's another silver stick .
probably will not do pick up a washer with two silver sticks at the bottom of the chain instead of just one .
too powerful .
pull one silver stick off the chain dangling from the silver bowl .
that'green triangle too heavy i think .
he'chi's into magnets .
chi wants magnets .
know referent unclear ?
will not thin refrigerator magnet pick up ?
no ?
that'referent unclear a copper penny .
copper pennies should never pick up .
that time it .
did you see silver stick at the bottom of the chain bend ?
hear the n .
noise ?
sounds like .
let's build these silver men .
take everything .
build the silver men up ?
how do you want to build silver men ?
what about trying to do one like ?
one of my .
one of my things .
this referent unclear .
you hear referent unclear ?
you can put a magnet in hturtle .
you can ?
like the red ball .
or something .
maybe see if you can put a ball in under the turtle's shell and then we can move hturtle around the table .
think so ?
i can't .
get a big .
no .
try this yellow wand .
try this yellow wand .
put hturtle down .
see if you can make hturtle move around .
he has already got a ball inside turtle .
what are you trying ?
it'turtle going to be powerful .
think so ?
boy .
it's already dark outside .
no that silver bowl .
smarter than you .
jeez !
i didn't do it .
he'silver man falling flat on his face .
should be silver man more .
nope .
no more .
what i'm going to do is .
put this up here .
put silver man on on top of the silver men .
and move silver man .
look at what i'm doing .
make height of the the two silver sticks a little bit short .
you touched my piece =?
men = silver man .
he silver man mot is tapping will not do rock back and forth without falling over .
try making mot's silver man rock back and forth without falling down .
try it .
mousetrap !
how come mot's silver man don't do rock back and forth ?
how come mot's silver man don't ?
it will not do it chi .
how come my silver man don't do rock back and forth ?
it's not funny !
how come silver man don't ?
silver man don't .
how come silver man will not do rock back and forth ?
how come silver man don't do rock back and forth chi ?
try making mot's silver man rock !
let's try one of another silver man which was lying on the table .
nope .
did made mot's silver man rock back and forth !
mot's second silver man will not do rock back and forth .
how come silver men will do rock and silver men don't ?
it's no fair .
chi's silver man will not go down .
okay .
it'what allows the silver men to rock right over here in that specific area in center of base .
haha .
watch .
the dancing partners .
no dancing no dancing without a partner ?
try putting a third silver man between the two silver men .
then they'three silver men probably be all sticked together .
look at three silver men !
well see you are a professional magnet here .
he likes magnets .
we've always .
i've got magnets all over the place .
there's gotta be a whole bunch of thmagnets upstairs in his room .

now the money in there is on purpose ?
you can't keep the money .
what ?
that'black base a strong magnet .
very strong .
don't hurt yourself .
does plastic turtle open ?
the magnet's inside black base .
watch .
do you think .
is the magnet inserted in black base ?
how can they tell if it'black base?
see how nickel moves around ?
watch .
right .
how can you test magnet in black base?
like maybe put nickel .
here .
versus over here because .
wait .
we just put the magnet on this side ?
to see if there's a difference .
nope .
does the coin .
the coin's not staying with it .
try that on the other side of the .
coin .
try this one .
will the coin stay ?
nope .
let's try one that we know works .
this ?
why don't you make one of your creations ?
here's a stick .
look at yellow wand over the base !
chi .
feel that .
what's happening there ?
what do you think is going on ?
why did it do that ?
because the magnet's on this side .
well the magnet's on .
both sides .
but what you s .
remember what you learned about .
what was it in that that the book we read about .
magnets and electromagnetic energy ?
do you remember what it said about .
positive and negative .
connections ?
do you remember what that said ?
no .
do you remember what that said ?
hello !
what did it say ?
what ?
remember what we read ?
i didn't think you were =?
on .
remember what we read in that in your book for .
the electromagnetic energy ?
the light and electricity and stuff ?
about the positive and negative .
whatever waves ?
how it caused ?
you know .
some attract and some repel ?
do you remember that ?
yes .
positive and negative .
energy ?
so what do you think is going on here ?
because these are magnets just like what we read about .
i know .
do you remember what it said about .
positives and negatives ?
what did it say ?
because that'll help explain why this on this side what is it doing ?
compared to this side ?
okay =?
wait .
it's making it .
i don't know .
wait a minute .
you know what ?
i asked you to make one of these neat figures .
i really want you to .
but i just want you to figure this out for a minute first .
okay ?
can you do that ?
just for a minute ?
and then you can do that ?
wait a second .
just i just want you to answer me this .
because that'll help you figure a lot .
why is it that this one pushes off ?
pushes away from the top of the black base and that it'the yellow wand attracting side of the black base .
because this is a .
positive .
this one's negative .
that part's negative .
and this one's .
negative .
and that one's negative .
what's this called when they when they push away ?
negative .
are they attractive or or repeling ?
repeling .
what does that mean ?
that .
it bounces off .
right ?
it pushes away ?
that .
one's negative .
that .
that one's negative .
this one's positive .
so what happens when .
you're going like that ?
what's that connection ?
when there's =?
this .
positive and positive .
come together .
no .
that's when they attract .
right ?
right .
and i forget .
was it negatives ?
positives ?
negative and .
i forget what it was .
positives .
this one's pogitive positive .
but .
one one connection of them .
attract .
and one combination of them repel right ?
cool .
you can actually .
do you think you could move like .
move a car that way ?
if you put yellow wand?
in the engine .
and you put it on wheels ?
and made it move .
look .
that's not the one !
you think you could though ?
with that kind of energy ?
see how you how see how you make it move ?
without even touching it ?
wouldn't that be neat if you could like .
power a car that way ?
and you wouldn't need any gas ?
chi .
imagine that you had the wheels .
right ?
put the wheels on the side .
imagine you could glue them on and they would turn .
right ?
do you think you could make black base roll ?
with yellow wand just this electric magnetic energy ?
do you think ?
maybe .
i think that's kind of neat .
do you ?
well i forget what combinations of positive and negatives it is but we could look that up .
why don't you make a platform for your for your stage ?
now do this .
because you make these awesome .
really awesome .
designs .
i know .
i'm just .
you have magnet balls at home .
right ?
these magnet balls ?
well actually !
you think you could .
you could make it a wheel with it ?
i don't want to do it like that .
look .
does chi's construction re is chi's construction repeling ?
i think that we needta get some more .
make them .
these silver men .
you know how like the yellow wand?
was pushing like that ?
if you can make one of the guys kind of standing up somehow ?
stand up ?
like .
like .
you know like with the that repeling ?
if you could keep keep silver man suspended .
above .
something .
like being pulled with the magnetic .
energy this way .
right ?
watch .
this it could stand up like that .
but to have that .
no .
to have that yank ?
that that .
you know that pull ?
see that pull ?
but not have yellow wand actually touch .
just .
see that ?
how it's not touching .
but if you can feel the pull down ?
what's the difference in yellow wand ?
does other side of wand do the same thing ?
now try try the difference on on here .
see if see both sides .
if it'yellow wand the same on both sides .
it's not the same .
it's not ?
is one repeling and one attracting ?
what about the sides ?
sides are .
staying .
they're different too .
try and make make one of your figures .
you know ?
some awesome things .
i keep interrupting you .
sorry .
have it ?
he's smart ?
okay .
make something make something neat .
see ?
here's what i did .
i know you did .
make one of your little things .
one of your shapes .
none of the coins are .
magnetic ?
nope .
how do you know ?
you know they're made out of different metals .
don't you ?
right ?
made out of different metals .
so that .
and .
so .
and they will not stick .
none of them will ?
nope .
watch .
no .
what's a penny what's a penny made out of ?
steel ?
no .
i don't know .
copper .
what about if you turn coins over ?
do you think it makes a difference ?
no it doesn't .
how about on the back side of the magnet ?
okay .
we'll stop .
you can make your design now .
imagine how tall how tall you can .
make it .
i can make it .
there you go .
i'll give you the .
pieces and you can do it .
okay ?
mom give me pieces .
are there any silver men ?
now imagine if silver men weren't magnetic .
silver men wouldn't stay up too well would they ?

books we had rocks ?
peace full name and full name .
that's me .
alright .
i love it .
i just love it .
that's so classic .
alright .
before we talk about chess , i'd like to learn something about you .
i'm going to ask you a few general questions .
then you can ask me some questions , too .
okay ?
okay .
do you have any brothers or sisters ?
yes , one brother and two sisters .
what are their names ?
my brother is ic karston .
and then my two sisters are ic athena and francis .
how old are they ?
karsten is ic five .
and athena is ic seven .
and francis is ic ten .
so i guess that puts you kind of in the middle there .
one of the middles but the older one .
what else can you tell me about them ?
well francis , wait i can not think ic of anything except that karsten is nom so cute and athena is nom sort of like one of those boy one of those mixed boy girl .
she is ic a girl .
and that is ic the girl part .
and then she is ic a boy .
well she likes ic sports .
and she is ic rough and stuff .
well not really rough .
she is ic pretty tough .
and then francis is ic pretty fragile .
do you have any pets at home ?
yes , two cats .
can you tell me anything about your pets ?
well they are ic about one year old .
and we go ic and snuggle them and pet them daily .
and we feed ic them daily .
and we get ic the water about once in three days , well a bit more than that because the water freezes avc over night .
so then there is their names are ic midnight and starlight .
those are pretty names .
and you can pretty much tell ic what color midnight is nom .
black .
but starlight is ic sort of brown and black .
mostly brown like a mix .
do you like to read books or magazines ?
i sometimes well my mom and dad want ic me to read books .
but when i do avc read them , i sort of get ic like hypnotized .
and i cannot stop ic reading if it is avc a good book .
but about every night , i read ic magazines to karsten .
and what have you read recently ?
well he really likes ic the ranger ricks because i read avc him like the animal stuff .
and then there is ic a comic .
what book did you read recently ?
well he likes ic hearing them over again .
so i have ic recently done gorilla .
and i have done .
wait , there is ic a raccoon one .
and then i forgot ic the other two .
so you like to read it sounds like .
do you have any questions for me ?
no .
now i would like to ask you about chess .
how long have you played chess ?
for about six years .
how old were you when you first started to play ?
three .
and who taught you how to play chess ?
a mix because my grand dad , mom and dad , computer games , and chess clubs and stuff .
at my school and stuff .
do you have a chess rating ?
who rates ?
it is ic some book .
a book ?
do you have a chess coach or a teacher ?
that is ic a hard question because i go avc to chess club that has rc a teacher and a coach .
but we just got ic the coach like two weeks ago .
so who is your teacher , chess teacher .
one of my friend's mom .
i do ic not really know her name .
and who is your chess coach ?
i know ic he is pretty .
well , you could call ic him chubby .
because i know ic calling is not nice .
and then he has ic sort of whitish gray hair .
so he is ic pretty old .
but that is ic pretty much all i know nom about him .
how often do you play chess say in a typical week ?
about two games a week .
two games a week ?
, because i usually play ic card games .
who do you play with most ?
my mom .
so you play two games a week with your mom .
mostly .
i sometimes play ic with my school friends .
can you name any famous chess players ?
no .
do you ever play chess on a computer ?
a lot .
i have ic like three chess programs .
and can you tell me about that ?
i have never done that .
one is ic majestic chess .
and that is ic my favorite one by far .
and it is ic like advanced chess .
and that is ic about my level .
and then there is ic chessmates which is rc beginning chess .
and there is ic like two things two chess games at my mom's work .
one is ic like space chess .
and then the other is ic like normal chess , just against the computer .
you play a lot of different chess games .
yes .
is that challenging for you ?
some of them like the normal chess one and space and chess in space .
can you adjust how hard they play ?
in a scale in one and ten chess mates is ic probably one .
and majestic chess is ic probably seven .
and then chess in space would probably be ic eight .
and then normal chess is ic probably nine and a half .
so that is the most difficult one .
now tell me why you enjoy chess .
for one thing it is ic fun .
and two you just have ic a good feeling when you have avc won .
and i am ic good at chess .
and well i know ic every game i play rc i pretty much get nom better .
how do you know you get better ?
because like my grand dad says ic stuff like , he says .
and my chess coach says ic stuff like it is nom better when you lose avc because you learn avc their moves and then you are nom able to do those .
so then if you always play avc them and lose and then you play avc other people and stuff and then people who you loose rc before , you might be ic able to beat them .
and then they might then if you play avc them again , they might have ic new moves .
and if you played avc the people you have play rc after them you might beat ic them .
so you learn new moves when you lose .
and sometimes when you win avc because when you win avc , it is ic not always by a long shot .
like sometimes i win ic .
and all i have is ic a queen , two pawns .
and that is ic about all .
so it is pretty evenly matched game .
completely even at starting .
i am not to familiar with the game of chess , you probably know a lot more about it than i do .
so i would like you to explain some things to me .
first of all how many people may play a game of chess at one time ?
with just one chess set ?
yes .
two .
i have heard of simultaneous matches .
do you know what that is ?
no .
please tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move .
first there are ic pawns which like are rc worth like one point .
and they can move ic two forward on their first move and otherwise one .
but you can have ic a choice to move two or one .
then with other pawns you are only allowed ic to attack diagonally .
and then you are able say it is .
you move ic there and then another one .
and then another pawn moves ic two .
because it is ic like they are saying nom you cannot get nom me because i am avc right beside you .
but then there is ic a move for that if you are avc the pawn that did not happen rc to .
you just said ic the thing .
you can move ic diagonal if they had just moved avc one and captured them .
and then there is ic a knight which is rc worth three points .
it moves ic two in one way and then one in another way .
and it does not have it does not really have ic special moves .
it is ic just able to jump over pieces .
but it is ic not what it jumps nom over that it catches rc .
it is ic what it lands nom on .
it is ic the best against queens because queens have avc the power of rook and bishops .
then comes ic the bishop which is rc able to move however it wants avc diagonally .
and it does not really have ic any special moves either .
and then the rook that can move ic straight in any direction .
, it and the king .
if the bishop , rook and queen or bishop and rook on the other side are avc both gone then the king is ic able to castle which means avc that instead of moving one space always her can move nom two .
and then the rook jumps ic over him and goes right beside him .
and then there is ic the queen which has rc the powers of a rook and a bishop .
and the i forgot ic to count points .
the bishop is ic four points .
and the rook is ic five points .
but then the queen , since it has avc both of their powers , it is ic nine points .
but then the king is ic unlimited points because if you lose avc him .
well you cannot really lose ic him because when he cannot move avc anywhere and he is avc in danger then you lose nom the game if you are avc the one who did rc not do that .
and it is ic your king that is rc in danger .
and there is like well no piece can set ic the piece in danger because then on the next move the pawn would be avc able to capture the king .
and the king cannot move ic into danger .
and that is ic about all the basics and stuff .
now tell me about the goals of chess .
in other words , what are the players trying to do .
trying to checkmate ic .
but if they are avc losing by far then it is ic stalemate .
stalemate is ic a tie .
i only know ic like three or four of the ways to stalemate .
but there are ic seven stalemates .
seven ways to stalemate .
, but all of them , , your opponent has to like say ic your opponent does nom not know one .
that is ic a huge advantage because then you are avc able to try to do that one on him .
how many ways are there to checkmate ?
millions like any possibility that you can make ic .
and the king , how he moves ic is nom he has nom exactly the same power as the queen , is they can go nom anywhere around him as much as they want avc .
but then the king can only go ic just one space anywhere around him .
so it is ic pretty easy to get in danger and stuff .
and when you get avc him in danger , you say ic check so your opponent notices avc .
and then there is ic like , or something .
then you show ic them how he is nom in check .
and then say he , anywhere , well if he moves avc into danger or something it is ic an illegal move .
but say ic he cannot move nom anywhere and he is nom in danger , that checkmate can be nom any possibility with any position on the board .
he just has ic to not be able to move anywhere and be in danger .
that is ic why i do nom not like castling much because you are avc trapping your king in the corner .
and what you never want nom to do is ic have nom your king exactly at the corner especially when they are avc smoking you .
and that is ic about all .
now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
in other words tell me everything you can think of about the game of just so that someone who has never played before would know how to play .
well normally , like the basics or something , because normally it would take ic like fifteen minutes for a week everyday .
so then it would be ic about .
you can never put ic your king in check .
and you have ic to move him exactly the right way .
and there are ic tons of rules .
i do not know ic them all .
but i usually play ic completely right .
, you cannot ever touch ic your opponents pieces unless you are avc taking them .
do you mean ic like the person knew nom how to move the pieces or something ?
well , just the rules .
you already talked about how to move the pieces .
okay .
well that is ic about it .
okay now i would like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess .
make check mate ic .
that is ic the goal .
are there some key strategies that every good player should know to win ?
well one is to , i usually play .
i do not try ic to checkmate my opponent unless they are avc really bad and they will let anything slip avc until i catch avc their queen .
and a good strategy is ic catching their queen .
it is ic like trapping , like moving your queen where your bishop usually starts nom at and then moving your bishop in danger of their queen .
and then most of the time they do not see ic your queen .
so then but then my mom usually sees ic it because i have avc tried it on her like three thousand times .
and it has only worked ic like half of the time , the first half .
so then , , it like you and then the queen tries ic to take your bishop .
and then you use ic your queen to catch their queen .
that is ic what my main thing of catching the queen .
and then you try ic to checkmate them because one unless they have avc their queen and their rooks , if they just have avc like one rook and if they lost avc a rook and a queen , they are avc usually on the defense trying to get their pawns to the other side because you get avc any piece you want rc besides a king if you get avc your pawn to the other side .
but pretty much all computer games just give ic you a queen .
that is ic pretty much the best thing you can get rc .
but i sometimes on those that let you rc , i get ic knights because they can move avc where queens cannot nom .
and that is ic about all .
how long does it take to play a game of chess .
if the people are equal ?
sure .
forty five minutes .
what makes a game last a long time ?
it is ic some , well like a ninth of the time .
is i am ic thinking .
but then it is just it is ic going to take a lot of moves to get checkmate because you have got avc to .
it takes ic like five minutes to get that catch their queen thing developed then another move to catch the queen once the queen got avc its set .
it takes ic like six moves to do that in the first place .
and each time it takes ic five seconds to think .
and that and then you imagine ic if you have nom hundreds of plots like that and only half of them work nom .
and then you have ic to do them over .
and then like every time half of them work ic .
it would take ic a long time .
so you said plot , do you mean plan .
a plan .
and when you are planning your attack , how many moves ahead do you think ?
i usually have ic a range of about fifteen .
more like ten .
my mom would know ic because she always fights avc me .
that is amazing .
what makes a game end quickly .
good strategies .
or try playing ic a bad player a beginner .
do you know how to use a chess clock .
not really .
i sometimes use ic it .
like i just do not know ic how to set it up and stuff .
but i use ic it .
well , can you tell me about it a little bit ?
well , there is ic a bunch of different times you can set rc .
like when i play avc chess at my chess club i usually do ic it for ten minutes for each player .
okay .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess .
it is ic very fun .
and it is ic one of those things that , if you lose avc you learn nom more .
and it is not really it is ic one hundred percent skill , well , ninety nine .
who forgets ic a lot of stuff .
and they may forget ic that your queen is nom very dangerous .
and that is ic about all .
well thanks very much .

now tell me about the goals of chess .
in other words , what are the players trying to do ?
they are trying ic to make it so the other player loses nom by getting them in a position where one of your pieces can capture nom theirs .
okay .
well their king .
okay .
now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
in other words , tell me everything you can think of about the game of chess so that someone who has never played before would know how to play .
well how everything moves nom which i already explained ic .
if your king is in check avc which is rc if your , your opponents one of your opponent's pieces can capture avc it , then you have ic to move your king or stop it king from being in check .
and if your king is in check avc and it can not move avc anywhere then it is ic in checkmate .
and the game is ic over .
the person that got rc the check mate not happen to them wins ic .
okay .

five seconds ?
there is ic a four move check mate .
and some masters it takes ic them about three hours sometimes .
it is ic really crazy .
what makes a game of chess last a long time ?
when you do not trade ic pieces like bishops taking bishops and not really making any threats .
what makes a game end quickly ?
when you make ic a mistake that loses rc one of your pieces and puts rc you in a bad position .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
can you tell me about it ?
there is ic two clocks .
kinda like that i guess ic .
and they are connected ic by a wooden thing .
there is ic a button that you press rc .
and it makes ic the other person's timer go nom .
and you can set ic it to like anywhere between an hour and a few seconds .
of course if you set avc it for a few seconds the person who goes rc first is going ic to lose .
i see .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess ?
not really .

i do ic not really .
you don't really , but you still play sometimes ?
sometimes , when i get ic bored .
i am not too familiar with chess actually , so you probably know a lot more about it than i do .
so i would like you to explain some things to me , okay .
well , each .
let me ask the question first .
first of all , how many people play a game of chess at one time ?
two usually .
but if you are avc doing a bug house which is rc with four people , there are ic four people .
and then and then capture like so this person will be ic black .
and his partner will be ic white .
and this person will be ic white .
and his partner will be ic black .
he will be ic white .
he will give ic it to this guy .
and he can put ic it anywhere on the board .
i have never heard of that .
it is ic kind of like a made up game .
i have heard of simultaneous matches , do you know what that is ?
no .
tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move .
first there is ic pawns .
and they just move ic forward .
and to capture they have to move ic diagonally .
so if he is right here avc then the guy i need to capture rc is ic here .
if he is avc here he has ic to move here .
and no one can move ic backwards .
and then there is ic the rook which you move rc like that like that .
you can move ic like this and like this just not diagonally .
, and the pawns can only move ic one space .
and rooks can move ic wherever they want nom .
and bishops can move ic only diagonally .
and then the queen can move ic any way except like this .
knights go ic like this .
they go ic one two three , one .
they move ic like that .
the queens can not move ic like that .
how about the king ?
the king can move ic any direction but only one space .
now tell me about the goals of chess .
in other words , what are the players trying to do ?
the king , you want ic to put it so you can capture nom .
but you can not capture ic it .
and then , if you put avc it so you can capture , nom you say ic check .
and then they try to and then they can move ic away .
but if they can not move away avc because they are surrounded avc then you win ic .
and then there is ic one type of game which is rc capture the king that is nom where you have to capture them and you do not have nom to say check .
so it is ic harder because you can be avc in check .
and you do not know ic it .
and they just capture ic you .
now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
in other words tell me everything you can think about the game of chess so that someone who has never played before would know how to play .
basically , you just kind of move ic around .
whenever i play avc , i put ic two bishops and a pawn and like push it out so it catapults avc the pawn into the other person .
, and then there is ic one type of chess called .
my brother made ic it up .
it is called ic bomb chess .
it is ic like you move nom your pawn somewhere .
and everywhere he can and like everywhere and like somewhere around him they will all get ic captured .
it is ic weird .
that is called bomb chess ?
i think ic it is nom like bomb .
no , it is ic nuclear chess .
nuclear chess .
it is ic weird .
so do you make up chess games too ?
no .
now i'd like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win a game of chess .
in other words , what are some key strategies that good players should know ?
you can basically , you just can capture ic them .
my brother moves ic a two move checkmate .
but the other person has ic to use do use the right move or else it does not work nom .
is that the only strategy ?
is there another strategy ?
well , i do not really know ic any good strategies .
you just kind of move ic around until you capture avc them really .
you mentioned using a bishop and a pawn .
is that a strategy ?
not really .
my strategy is ic just move nom around until you get avc them .
okay , how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
for me , it takes ic about i don't know half an hour .
and then sometimes you can get sometimes you can get ic like two hour games .
that is ic with the really good people who are rc using really good strategies and counter strategies and stuff .
so it takes ic a long time because most of them go avc so they do not let avc themselves win or lose .
what makes a game last a long time ?
if there is avc not many pieces that can move rc around good , like , if it is like avc , i don't know , a bishop , pawn , king and you can not move avc around , then it is ic harder because you can not move avc all the directions .
what makes a game end quickly ?
if you have good pieces and you are just kind of if one person is avc pretty good and the other person is avc not so good , it makes ic it easier .
so .
and then they will not be ic able to move really .
so when you play your brother , is it usually a long game or a short game ?
usually it is ic pretty long because he plays avc easy on me .
he is ic like rated nine hundred some .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
chess clock ?
you just well , that is ic for timed games .
so those are ic usually short because one person will .
that is ic really fast game so if you move avc you click nom it .
if other player moves avc , they will click ic it .
if you want avc to take time and then if time runs out avc when it is avc your turn , you lose ic .
so how long are those games usually ?
pretty short .
i do not know ic .
i do not really know ic .
i just kind of know ic about them .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess ?
not really .
well , thanks again for talking with me today .
tell me about your family ?
well my mom and dad both work ic at intel .
and he sort of wants ic to go to villanova .
that is ic a college .
well my grandma sometimes comes ic to live with us for a few months .
but she usually stays ic back in china if she wants adv to .
so you have brothers and sisters .
i do not have ic a sister .
i only have ic one older brother .

and that is ic well a lot about him .
and he is ic always sort of friendly .
he likes ic to play games .
but he does not play ic as often as usual now because now he usually just goes adv and plays with his friends .
so you are about thirteen ?
i am ic thirteen .
no i am ic twelve .
so he is five years older than you .
do you have any pets at home ?
, i have ic a cat .
can you tell me more about your pet ?
her name is ic tia .
we gave ic her a chinese name , chau chau .
it means ic , she likes nom to jump a lot .
because when we got adv her home in the crate she kept jumping ic all around .
and well she is ic really funny .
she is ic old .
well she is ic really really fat .
she learned ic how to get the food out of the crate .
like she can jump ic up and then open it with her paws .

the movie cut ic out some things .
and sometimes in the book , i pictured ic what the people looked nom like .
and it was ic totally different than the movie .

what is it ?
one thousand four hundred fifty i think ic or somewhere around there .
do you have a chess coach or teacher ?
, carl and chuck .
they are ic both my teachers .
can you tell me about them ?
carl is ic sort of the one that gets rel real mad at you if you do not remember adv things .
but chuck is ic sort of the nice guy .
and like he will always give ic you another chance .
is it here at the school ?
where is it located ?
i can get ic lessons from them .
but it is ic a lot of money .
so usually we just go ic to the chess club .
and they teach ic all of us .
and the chess club is ?
here at school .
do you belong to a chess club ?
yes , the isb dragons .
how often do you play chess say in a typical week ?
maybe four times a week .
like i just play ic a few games against my dad .
and the name was ic dragon knights .
who do you play with the most ?
probably my dad .
can you name any famous chess player ?
there is ic a lot more .
do you ever play chess on a computer ?
yes well , not really because we do not have ic any really good chess programs .
but my dad plans ic to buy me one for christmas if he can adv .
tell me why you enjoy chess .
well , i like well when you win adv it always feels ic good when you get adv to say checkmate and all that stuff .
and it always feels ic nice when your rating goes adv up .
so i like enjoy ic winning .
but i also like ic playing the well like sort of mini games .
like you can play ic those really short games .
or you can play ic games with all different types of rules .
it is ic really fun .
so you like winning and you like learning the different rules .
, i like ic learning the different rules and studying new openings and all that stuff .
have you ever played any female opponents ?
, a lot .
do you find it different playing a girl ?
no .
we just try ic to beat them .
do you think more boys play chess than girls .
i know a lot of the famous ones you mentioned were men .
are there any women ?
susan polgard , there are ic a lot of girls .
like there is ic this chinese woman .
i forgot ic what her name is .
me and my dad always watch ic the games she has rel .
but she was ic really good .
but i forgot ic what her name was nom .
how do you watch the games ?
do you record them on tv ?
you can usually google ic them .
just look ic for chess games .
then it will go ic to chess center dot com .
and you can watch ic live games .
or you can watch ic games that have already been played rel .
you just play ic through them and then talk about them .
do you learn a lot by watching that or is it too complicated ?
i sometimes learn ic a lot .
but sometimes it is ic just moves that do not make sense rel to me or my dad .
so usually i bring ic them in to have my chess coach examine them and see what she was nom doing in that position .
i am not too familiar with the game of chess .
you probably know a lot more than i do .
so i would like you to explain some things to me .
first of all , how many people may play a game of chess at one time ?
two people .
i have heard of simultaneous matches .
do you know what that is ?
simultaneous matches are ic where usually one grand master plays nom a lot of people at the same time .
so he walks ic around the table and makes moves .
and he keeps ic on doing that until he either beats adv everybody or loses .
so , that is ic what a simultaneous match is nom .
tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move .
okay , the king , it , the king , it can move ic forward , diagonally and left and right .
but it can only move ic one square either forward , diagonally or left and right .
and it can also move ic backwards .
and the queen , it can move ic forward , diagonally , left and right .
but it can move ic as many squares as it wants adv to .
but it can not jump ic over pieces .
and then the knight , it moves ic sort of in an l shape .
so it goes ic forward two squares and turns left or right .
and then it can either go ic right two squares and turns left or right .
and then it can turn ic go down two squares and turn left or right .
and then goes ic left two squares .
it can and then go ic up one square or down one square .
and it can jump ic over pieces .
and the rook , it can go ic forward and backwards and left and right as far as it wants adv to .
but it can not jump ic over pieces .
and the pawn , on its first it can move ic two squares .
but on the other moves it can not ic .
and if you get adv it to the last rank which is rel where your opponent usually has nom his king , then you can promote ic it into anything but a king or a pawn .
and the bishop moves ic diagonally as far as it wants adv to .
but it can not jump ic over pieces .
now tell me about the goals of chess .
in other words , what are the players trying to do ?
in the beginning they try ic to gain advantages .
and the advantages are ic to be ahead in development , get more space , to have more force , to have better pawn structure and to have more material which means rel you have nom more pieces than your opponent .
so in the beginning , you usually first try ic to get all your guys out and attack for the center .
and once you get adv all your guys out , you try ic to gain one of the five advantages or more .
in the middle game , you try ic to get all your pieces to the best squares .
and then you evaluate ic your advantages .
and if you have adv the right advantages , you should try ic to attack the other person's king in the middle games .
and if you have adv the other advantages , you can go ic to an end game because if you are adv out of material in an end game , it is nom probably more valuable because there are adv less pieces on the board .
and in the end game , you try ic to get your king to the center .
and if you have adv a rook , get ic it behind the pass pawn or on the seventh ranks .
and you try ic to promote a pawn in the end game .
and that is ic about it .
now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
in other words tell me everything that you can think of the game of chess so that someone who has never played before , would know how to play the game .
do i have ic to explain how the pieces move nom again ?
no , other than that .
so you just have ic to make sure the pieces move nom in the right places .
and when you are adv in check , you have ic to move your king .
either take ic the piece that is rel checking you , move your king , or block the check .
and you cannot castle ic through check .
and your pawn can only move ic two squares on the first move .
and if you touch adv your piece , you have ic to move it .
and you have ic to hit the clock .
you have ic to move and then write your notation before .
you can not write ic your notation and then move which i think nom that is nom just a weird rule .
i think ic that is nom all the rules .
but i am ic not sure .
now i would like you to to tell me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess .
in other words , what are some key strategies that every good player should know .
well did not i sort of explain ic that ?
key strategies .
previous one .
like i explained ic all the good strategies .
were there any others that you left out ?
well there is ic a lot .
so in the opening , you try ic to get all your guys out because you will probably have adv more space .
you attack ic the center in the opening because the center is adv where all the pieces tend nom to point at .
and you have ic to keep your king safe .
and the middle game you have ic to see if your advantages are nom material or pawn structure .
you generally want ic to go to the end game because those are adv more important in the end game .
and if your advantages are adv time and space and force then you really want ic to attack the king because if you go adv to the end game those really do not matter nom any more .
and so in the end game the strategy is ic usually to well get all your pieces on their best squares first , get your rook behind a pass pawn or on the seventh rank , get your king in the center of the board or to a good square .
well , those are ic some key strategies .
what does pass pawn mean ?
it is ic where a pawn , you know how in the beginning all the pawns are lined up .
it is ic a pawn that you can rel , if nobody can stop adv it like if there is adv only pawns on the board and it is adv a pawn that can run rel all the way up and promote without going into the line of fire .
and like a pawn can attack ic diagonally .
so you want your king behind that ?
no you want ic your rook behind that because you can usually push adv it .
so every square it moves rel to your rook will always protect ic it .
and your king can also guard ic it too .
so the king is where ?
behind the pawn or on the side ?
the king can usually go ic to the side .
but it really depends ic .
like the king , depending on the position , your king can either guard ic your pawn and you can keep nom on pushing it .
or the king can try ic to gain some space and sort of eat the other guy's pawns .
so .
it seems like that would make your king vulnerable to being attacked .
, but usually in the end game there are ic not many pieces .
so it is ic hard to checkmate .
there is ic usually just a rook or a bishop or a knight .
and you usually cannot checkmate ic the king that easily unless you get adv a better piece .
and you can only checkmate ic with a rook or a queen .
or in the end game if you only have adv one piece , you can only checkmate ic with a rook or a queen or a pawn because you can promote adv it into a rook or a queen .
that is interesting .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
that really depends ic .
like if you want adv to just play a fast game and have fun then you could play ic in just five or ten minutes .
but if you really want adv to play like a serious game , like at the chess nationals , it takes ic four hours which is rel sometimes really boring because you have adv to just sit there and just wait for my opponent to move .
but it gives ic you a lot of time to think about the position and apply all the rules that our chess coach told rel us to think about and positions where you really do not know rel what to do .
and so if you want adv to play a good game , maybe four hours but generally , it should take ic only about an hour or so .
so when you are playing game do you have to sit there at the table the whole time .
no you do not have ic to .
you can go ic to the bathroom , get a drink or just walk around look at other games .
can you go look at a chess book ?
no they usually keep ic you in a room and make sure you do nom not leave unless you go adv to the bathroom .
so everything you have to remember what the strategies are in your head .
, you do ic .
what makes a game last a long time ?
well , complicated positions where everything is ic locked up .
and well you have ic to maneuver everything into a new position and then hope your opponent just breaks nom and like messes up .
or you can just try ic to break through the position .
and usually in the end game , it takes ic a long time because in the end game , you have adv to calculate the most .
what makes the game end quickly ?
probably when you lose adv control of the center really early in the game , your opponent usually gains ic lots of advantages .
it can checkmate ic you in the middle game .
and it depends ic .
but if they are adv in the middle game , and they have adv time and space and force then they can probably find ic a sequence that can checkmate rel you .
why is it so important to gain advantage in the center .
wouldn't it make your piece more vulnerable if you're always trying to gain the center of the board ?
well the center of the board is ic where a lot of space is nom .
so you try ic to take over the center .
and it kind of cramps ic up your opponent's position .
say you have ic two pawns here .
it takes up ic these four squares in the center because they attack adv diagonally both ways .
and so your opponent can not really get ic its pieces out through the center while your pawns are adv there .
and so it really cramps ic your opponent for space .
and then the last question , what makes ic a chess game shorter ?
well you can also just sack ic a piece .
and that would also make ic it just really quick .
a person makes a mistake .
, like loses ic a queen or something .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
can you describe how to use that .
well , a chess clock , well there are ic like a lot different ones .
but i have ic an analog clock .
and you basically you just hit ic the timer .
and then you can set ic it .
there is ic like a plus and minus button .
and you can hit ic plus .
and you just add ic minutes onto the chess clock .
and you can add ic hours and all that stuff .
so it is ic really easy .
but sometimes you have ic to use an analog clock which is rel basically a normal clock except you can nom set the time back .
and then it just keeps ic on ticking .
and then so if you want adv to set it for an hour you put ic it here .
and there is ic a flag at the very top .
so when it goes adv all the way around and it goes adv back to the hour then the flag will fall ic .
that means ic you ran nom out of time .
there are two clocks in this ?
no no , there is ic one clock that has rel two timers on each side .
okay .
so like you hit ic a button .
and the other person's time is ic ready .
so it automatically starts when you stop yours .
the other person's automatically starts when you stop yours ?
, so you hit ic your button .
and his starts ic .
well basically , the button makes ic his button go nom up .
so that makes ic it .
so that makes ic it so he has nom to make a move and then press it again .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess ?
not really .
no ?
well thanks for talking with me .
you have been very helpful and i have enjoyed working with you .
do you have any brother or sister ?
i have ic two sisters but no brothers .
what are their names ?
adeana and dollia .
how old are they ?
one dollia is ic ten .
and adeana is ic fourteen .
what else can you tell me about them .
i get ic into fights with adeana .
but sometimes she helps ic me .
she is ic in high school .
and dollia is ic in fifth grade .
i can not think ic of anything else .
do you have any pets at home .
i have ic a whole bunch of goats , my sister's gold fish .
we have ic two cats .
and i have ic a tarantula .
can you tell me about your pet ?
my tarantula is ic fun to hold .
it is ic a chilean rose .
you can not hold ic it with your bare hands .
or else you will get ic rashes .
so you just hold ic it with gloves .
and my cats i have ic a black and a white cat .
my black cat is named ic pumpkin .
my white cat is ic named keta .
pumpkin he is ic really fun because you will never know avc what he will do nom next .
he'll just it is ic random .
and so keta , her mom ran away ic when she was avc just like a week old .
and we never found ic her mom .
and then keta is ic really old .
she is ic blind in one eye because the eye is avc all fogged up .
we do not know ic what to do about it .
i can not think ic of anything else .
do you have a favorite tv show or movie ?
my favorite tv show is ic probably probably like fear factor because they do avc really cool things that you can never think rc of .
and i think ic it is nom really cool .
is there a show that you watched recently that is interesting ?
well i watched ic a show called yugio .
it is ic a pretty good show .
i like ic it .
and it is ic cool .
do you like to read books or magazines ?
i ordered ic nintendo power .
and i ordered ic this lego magazine .
and i read ic books .
i am reading ic ink spell .
and that is ic a really good book .
what is ink spell about ?
ink spell is ic about this guy named mo .
he can read ic things in and out of books .
and so he just like reads ic stuff .
but his sister maggie read ic her into a book called ink heart which was rc the book before ink spell .
this guy named finoglio who made rc ink heart is ic now in ink heart , like the word ink heart .
and then and this guy named dust finger , he is ic like a fire eater .
and his apprentice named ferrid is ic trying to be a good fire eater .
and so and there is ic this guy called capricorn .
he got eaten ic by the shadow which was rc supposed to help him .
but the capricorn was ic bad so .
that is ic mostly it .
sounds like there are lots of interesting characters .
yep .
now i would like to ask you about chess .
how long have you played chess ?
for about like three or four years .
and how old were you when you first started to play ?
about like five or four , four or five .
who taught you how to play chess ?
my grandpa , my dad and the guy that teaches chess club at parker .
do you have a chess rating ?
yes , we have ic something called the chess ladder .
it's how people it is ic how we play nom against people .
if they are avc really high on the chess ladder then you are ic really good .
and if you are avc really low on the chess ladder that you can improve ic .
like like they go ic like three people down .
like , say that one person was avc first on the chess ladder and one person was avc third , they would probably play ic against each other .
and people the chess ladder goes ic down to ten people .
do you have a chess coach or a teacher .
yes .
can you tell me about him ?
he is ic cool .
and i like ic him .
he really teaches ic us how to play chess .
and he is ic fun to be around .
how often do you play chess , say in a typical week ?
probably once a week or twice a week .
who do you play with the most ?
i try ic to play against my grandpa .
but he does not have ic that much time to .
and i usually just play ic with the kids in chess club .
can you name any famous chess players .
no .
do you ever play chess on a computer ?
i am looking ic for a web site that is rc like world wide chess thing so you can play avc against people .
but i have not found ic it yet so , no .
i do not ic .
now tell me why you enjoy chess .
it is ic fun .
and it is ic like a strategy game .
and plus you never have you have ic to think at it .
and so .
so you like the strategy ?
, strategy , it is ic cool .
and you do not have ic to physically move your body that much .
all you have ic to do is move three fingers .
i am not familiar with the game of chess .
you probably know a lot more about it than i do .
so i would like you to explain some things to me .
first of all , how many people may play a game of chess at one time ?
two , but if you are playing avc bug house , then it is ic three too .
if you are playing avc bug house , it is ic two to three people .
so you can have two people and up to three people .
but not all on one board .
only two people can play ic on one chess board at a time .
i have heard of simultaneous matches .
do you know what that is ?
no , not really .
can you tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move .
the pawn well the pawn can move ic one place at a time .
but if it is avc the first time you move that pawn , you can move ic it once .
so you can move ic it like up one square or up two squares .
but that is ic the only time that you can move rc it up two squares .
the rook can only move ic in straight so like up left right down .
that is ic the only way .
knights can move ic up two and side three .
and they can ic hop over pieces .
so knights are ic really special .
bishops can only go ic diagonally .
queens are ic the second to best piece .
they can go ic diagonal or straight .
the kings are ic the most important piece .
if you get avc your king in checkmate then it is ic over .
and the king can only move ic one square at a time but in any direction .
so that is ic good .
if you get avc a pawn to the other side , then you get ic to turn it into whatever piece you want rc it to be .
and so like , and there are ic other like moves like the castle .
if you have not moved avc your rook with the king , then you can go ic like that .
like this is ic the king .
and this is ic the rook .
you can go ic like that .
and it is ic really cool .
are those all the pieces ?
you have ic two rooks , eight pawns , two knights , two bishops , one queen and one king .
now tell me the goals of chess .
in other words what are the players trying to do ?
they are trying ic to get the other king in checkmate before your team gets avc in checkmate .
if your king gets avc in checkmate , then you lose ic .
now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
in other words , tell me everything that you can think about the game of chess so that someone who has never played before would know how to play .
okay you can only move ic one piece per turn .
you can only like i already explained ic how you move nom the pawn .
so you can not ic .
the first rule that you have rc to follow is ic that you can not move nom into check .
that means ic you can not move nom your king so it is avc in danger .
so if your king is avc in check , and it is avc your turn to move it , then you have to either block ic that check or capture the piece that is rc checking the king or move your king out of the way .
and you can only , once you take or hand touch move is ic where if you touch nom a piece , then you have to move nom that piece if it is avc legal .
you can only okay if you let go avc of a piece , then if it is avc legal you have to keep ic it there .
it is ic stuck there .
well that is ic like all the positive rules .
okay , now i would like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win .
in other words , what are some key strategies that every good player should know ?
well , first you should know ic like a great opening move .
well , you should try ic to get your pieces in , but not like all of your pieces because you need avc to protect your king .
and , , that is ic like all the rules that you need to know rc .
so do you use some key strategies when you play ?
, sometimes i castle ic .
and some other times i just go ic for it .
and beginners , they they look ic at a place that is rc good .
and so they jump ic right on it .
but what's bad is that like if their so if you have avc like a queen , and you take avc a pawn with your queen , but then like a rook gets avc your queen , that is ic not a really good trade .
a fair trade would be ic like capturing a knight with your pawn but then having it taken by a knight .
that would be ic a good trade for you .
so you are getting the person's knight and they're getting a pawn ?
no wait , no so .
you capture ic a rook with your pawn .
and then they get ic your pawn with a knight .
that is ic a good trade .
if you get avc like a pawn for a pawn , that is ic a fair trade .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess .
about like five or six minutes .
what makes a game last a long time ?
probably getting into checkmate .
like you have ic to plan out your strategy , get your pieces to move , capture other pieces , narrow the king down , but protect your king .
that takes ic a lot of work .
what makes a game end quickly ?
probably , the shortest game ever of chess is ic a two move checkmate .
but you have to be ic on black to do this .
have you ever been in a short game ?
no , not really .
do you know how to use a chess clock .
yes .
can you tell me about it .
chess clocks are ic if you're if you are nom playing speed chess if your game is going nom for too long .
so after your move is played avc , you tap ic your thing sticking out .
and you push ic it down .
and there is ic this flag .
the minute hand is ic tipping the flag up .
but when the flag goes avc down , that means ic that you lose nom , no matter what .
or there are ic these digital clocks , where you don't , digital speed clock where you do not have to write nom it .
all you have rc to do is push ic it .
and you can set ic the game to like five minutes or four minutes for each person , .
have you ever used a chess clock ?
yes i have used ic a chess clock .
it was ic hard .
but i got ic a stale mate .
stalemate is ic where you get nom a draw .
stalemate is ic where your king is nom not in check but your king can not move nom anywhere without moving into check .
so it is ic stalemate .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess .
chess is ic hard .
you should not be ic like , if your opponent starts avc out weak than don't like , do not underestimate nom your opponent because tables could easily turn avc in chess .
it is ic not such an easy game .
nope .
that is ic mostly it .
thank you for talking with me today .
before we talk about chess , i would like to learn something about you .
i'm going to ask you a few questions and then you can ask me some questions back if you want , okay ?

and a lot of the people in the area are ic taught by them , .
when did they start , when were they first your coaches ?

two years .
do you play in chess tournaments and stuff ?
cool .
how often do you play chess , say , in like a typical week ?
well that depends ic .
like if i we have ic chess club every week .
but i really do not have ic that much time .
so i would say ic like once a week .
once a week ?
okay .
who do you play with the most ?
the chess club .
the chess club ?
is there a particular person you play with the most ?
no .
no ?
just with anybody ?
can you name any famous chess players ?
go ahead and tell me .
okay , so like kramnick , a guy named tall and short .
tall and short ?
can you tell me about them ?
well they are ic world champion like players .
not much .
how old are they ?
i do not know ic .
some of them are ic dead but .
really ?
okay , do you ever play chess on a computer ?
, sometimes .
tell me about what it's like to play chess on a computer .
well i have ic a program that i can rel play against .
but i do not play ic it on the internet .
i just play ic it against the computer .
and you can choose ic the rating of the person you want rel to play .
really ?
so are the higher ratings better and the lower ratings ?
okay .
so what ratings do you usually play against ?
well about a thousand i guess ic .
about the same ?
is it , do you think it's harder to play against the computer or harder against a real person ?
i would say ic it is nom harder to play against the computer .
well the problem if the person is adv the same rating as you then it is ic sometimes is easier .
sometimes is ic harder cuz the computer can know adv more things and just has adv to decide how many things it pretends nom not to see .
, okay .
so , .
do you , how often do you play on the computer ?
not often .
not very often ?
like once a week ?
okay .
now tell me why you enjoy chess .
is it challenging ?
, it is ic a challenge .
any other reasons why you like it ?
that is ic pretty much it .
okay , well i'm not too familiar with game chess and you probably know a lot more about it than i do , so i would like you to explain some things to me if that's okay .
first of all how many people may play a game of chess at one time .
two .
two ?
on one board .
on one board ?
i've heard of “simultaneous matches” , do you know what that is ?
, it is ic where there is nom like a round like a table going in a circle .
and some one or more people are ic in the middle .
and they will make ic the moves and go to the next board .
and then other people are ic on the outside but stay at the board .
, so how many people are in the middle at one time ?
up , from one to however many .
okay , and then they go around and they play all the people sitting around the outside ?
, or you could just have ic like two boards and two people at one at each board .
and one person is making ic the moves for both boards at the same time .
, so they're playing like different games all at once .
crazy .
that sounds pretty hard .
have you ever played a simultaneous match ?
where , you were in the inside ?
what was it like ?
freaky .
it sounds hard .
you have to remember a lot of things .
tell me about the different pieces and how they're supposed to move .
okay so the king can move ic any of the squares around it , but only one square .
and the queen can move ic any squares diagonally or across or up and down .
and then a pawn can move ic forward one square .
or if it is adv the first move the pawns made rel , it can move ic forward two squares .
and then it takes ic a piece one square diagonally to the diagonally forward .
and then a rook goes ic front up and down , side to side .
and then a knight can go ic two squares forward and one to the right or two to the right and one square forward or backward .
and and then a bishop can go ic on the diagonal .
and those are all the pieces ?
now tell me about the goals of chess .
in other words , what are the players trying to do ?
well the major goal is ic to make it so the king is nom being attacked by a piece and it has nom nowhere it can move rel .
and it has ic nowhere no pieces that can go rel in front of that piece that is attacking rel it and no pieces that can take rel those pieces that is attacking rel it .
okay , so when you're playing you want to , do you want to get my king if i was playing you ?
but it's it is ic not like you take nom the king .
it is ic just the king is trying nom to capture .
okay , can you capture other pieces too ?
, and those you just land ic on the square they are rel on and take them .
okay .
now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
in other words , tell me everything you can think about the game of chess so that someone who has never played , like me , , would know how to play .
then if you touch adv one of your pieces and you are legally allowed adv to move it then you have ic to move it .
and if you touch adv one of the other pieces and there is adv a piece you can take rel it with , you have ic to take it .
if you take adv your hand hand off of a piece once you moved adv it then you can not move ic it anywhere else .
you have ic to say “i adjust” nom before you can move adv a piece to the center of a square .
it is ic like if you just take adv a piece , but you leave adv your piece kinda almost on two squares you can just use nom it .
okay .
are there any other rules you can think of ?
not really .
now i'd like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess .
in other words , what are some key strategies that every good player should know .
well , you have ic to have a good opening , by getting the pieces on the row behind all your pawns .
you have ic to get those pieces out quickly .
and , you have ic to have a good defense around your king .
so how do you get those pieces out quickly ?
usually you move in the opening or first part of the game you would move ic at least two of your pawns forward two squares .
and then that leaves ic room to put some pieces out .
okay , are there any other strategies ?
what about defense ?
tell me some more about defense .
usually you get ic the pieces in between one rook and your king out .
and then you can castle ic your king , like kinda switching the position but one square in .
that's what castling is ?
, so it is ic basically if your rook is here adv and your king is adv here , your rook comes nom here and your king comes nom here .
and then that king , your that gets ic your king out of the center of the board .
why is it bad to be in the center of the board ?
because that is ic generally where your the other pieces are heading nom kinda .
okay .
so how far do you want your king to be from the middle ?
well also it depends ic .
because the another reason you would switch rel them is ic cuz there's nom still the pawns here and you usually push nom the center pawns .
and then so the main thing is ic to get several pawns in front of your king .
and it does not really matter ic where your king is nom , unless it , there is adv a certain place the other pieces are pointing rel .
okay .
so your pawns protect the king then ?
cool .
can you think of any other strategies ?
not really .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
, that completely varies ic .
like , there is ic clocks .
and i went ic to nationals .
and for nationals the each side can get ic two hours .
so it is ic a maximum of four hour games .
but usually it is ic about forty five minutes that you get rel for each side on a clock .
or if you are adv just playing a normal game it can be ic less , like twenty minutes .
so are all games timed then ?
no not all , like if all the tournament games usually are ic timed unless they are adv a really low section like little kids .
but like games where you just play rel for fun , are ic not usually timed .
no ?
okay .
what makes a game last a long time ?
if you have to think ic about the position a lot .
so if the position is ic something you do not see rel anything close to you usually .
are there any other reasons a game could last a long time ?
well mainly you just have ic to really think about the positions .
and you have to think ic about where you are going nom to move .
or you want to it is ic an important game .
and you want ic to consider all the possibilities that you have rel .
so in each turn there is lots of different possibilities where you can move your pieces ?
what makes a game end quickly ?
well , if you are playing ic someone who is , is , has rel a lot lower rating than you .
and , that is ic something that is rel pretty normal that you see rel a lot .
then it's easy to beat them quickly ?
do other games just end quickly even if you were at the same rating ?
not all the time .
no ?
is there a certain move that makes the game end quickly ?
no .
no ?
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
can you tell me about it .
so basically there's , well there is ic digital and analog clocks .
so digital are ic obviously more recent .
so for those you have ic usually a whole bunch of buttons and stuff you can push rel here .
and then you have ic two screens .
and they will have ic like just an amount of time on them .
and also there is ic some well .
and then there is ic two buttons up here usually .
they you can just push ic those .
and the other guy's time will start ic ticking .
and yours will stop ic .
and once you run out adv of time , then you lose ic the game if the other person has adv enough material to checkmate you with .
and then if , there is ic something called a delay on the clock , where it'll you push nom the clock and no one's time will tick nom for like five second delay .
no one's time will tick ic for five seconds .
and then their time will start ic .
when do you use that delay ?
the tournaments like ic to take five minutes off of the allowed time and put the five second delay .
and it basically means ic that if you have adv like just a few seconds left on the clock you can make nom really fast moves without losing time .
, okay .
so can you tell me about the analog clocks , are they different ?
well , the analog clocks are ic mainly the same .
it is ic just that they do not have nom all the fancy options and stuff like that .
but there is ic still two buttons that you hit rel .
and they just have ic a little clock .
and you can set ic it on the back usually like a normal clock .
do they have any time delay too ?
no .
no ?
just the digital ones have that ?
that's cool .
is there anything else you want to tell me about the chess clocks ?
no that is ic basically it .
what else can you tell me about chess ?
you can tell me anything you can think of .
i can not think ic of anything .
well it is ic good to good to know some strategies and some openings that you have played rel before .
but also it is ic important to be able to assess the positioning of it .
and so , the two chess coaches , one teaches ic more the openings and stuff like that that is rel more “he moves here nom , he moves there nom ” .
and then the other teaches ic more the ideas to it and why would you do nom things certain things .
can you tell me more about the ideas ?
, so , well the ideas would be ic like , the idea of why you move nom something to , .
but it is ic not “you move nom this here to gain this” .
it is ic more of he is nom always putting up on the board that there are nom like these four areas of thinking and four levels of thinking .
and one is ic the , like the basics basic strategies .
and he is ic like .
i do not know ic how to describe the ideas really .
that's okay .
that's kinda hard , especially when i don't play , it's probably hard to explain it .
are there any like books or anything ?
, there is ic books that will have rel like games that people have rel played .
and then you can take ic the books and read through the games .
and you can learn ic stuff from other people's games .
like different strategies ?
and it will analyze ic the games .
so how does it , does it go like move by move ?
, well what it will do nom is ic it will say nom the moves .
but also it will say ic why they moved nom there , which is rel important to understanding .
is there anything else you can tell me about chess ?
not that i can think ic of .
so , before we talk about chess , i'd like to know some things about you .
okay .
so , i am going to ask you a few general questions .
all right .
and if you want , you can ask some questions too .
okay .
so , first question , do you have any brothers or sisters ?
i have ic a younger brother in fifth grade .

and how do the dog and the cat get along ?
pretty well since the cat is ic let me think eighteen now .
and he's still active ?

he is nom getting kind of deaf i think ic .
you guys must treat your animals really well to have them live so long .
tell me about your horse .
let us see ic .

how about movies ?
, let us see ic pirates of the caribbean , star wars , lord of the rings , and that new movie , stardust .
, i want to see that .
it is ic pretty good .
is it ?
, it sounds very interesting .
have you seen all three of the new pirates of the caribbean ?
i actually haven't seen any of them .
okay , so do you like to read books or magazines ?
books , yes .
you do ?
what do you like to read ?
i like ic fantasies , science fiction .
and i usually like ic a bit of mild darkness to them .
so , like the city of emperor stuff and harry potter .
do you read a lot ?
do you read more than you watch tv ?
unless i am ic someplace that has rel cable .
then i watch ic tv all the time .
, but you don't have cable at home i take it ?
no .
that's probably a good thing , ?
we have ic got an old analogue tv .
, really ?
okay , so well , do you want to ask me anything ?
not really .
okay , so now i am going to ask you about chess .
okay .
first of all , how long have you been playing chess ?
since third grade .
third grade okay .
so let's see , that probably about eight years old or so ?
, that was the next question , how old were you when you first started to play ?
who taught you to play chess ?
actually my dad bought ic a chess computer program .
so i took ic the chess tutorial and learned to play .
does your dad play chess as well ?
sometimes .
did you ask him to buy you the tutorial or did he just do that on his own ?
i think ic he just got nom it because he thought adv chess was nom something that i needed rel to know .
, okay .
does your brother play ?
do you have a chess rating ?
i am ic not really sure i know nom what that means nom .
i'm not either actually .
it's obviously it will tell you what level you are at , but we don't have to worry about that because you do not have one it sounds like .
i don't either .
do you have a chess coach or a teacher ?
miss mix who runs ic the chess club sort of .
okay .
she runs is ic in charge of the chess club here at school .
and so , you can ask her questions .
does she instruct you ?
not so much me but some more beginning players .
okay .
cause i know ic pretty much all the stuff .
and so do you belong to a chess club ?
sort of .
it is ic kind of a drop in thing .
how often do you go ?
every wee week and if i do not have ic a ton of homework or it is adv not cancelled or something .
okay , so it's just once one day a week ?
and what is that called ?
just “chess club” .
chess club , ” okay .
and in a typical week , how much would you say you play chess ?
about three we usually play ic about three games at chess club , and one game over the weekend .
okay .
and who do you play with the most ?
people at chess club , people who are ic always there like me .
okay , are there a lot of those regulars ?
a few .
do you have one particular player you like to play with the most ?
i like ic playing with terin because he is adv funny .
keeps it light ?
okay , great .
can you name any famous chess players ?
no .
that is just fine .
you are too busy playing chess rather than watching it and reading about it .
okay , and do you ever play chess on a computer ?
tell me about that .
well it is ic pretty much the same as playing for real except some except you would sometimes eeasier because you can not make adv a mistamistake .
like when you are adv in check it will not let ic you move anything that would .
well you have ic to get out of check .
so it will not let ic you move anything that will do rel something other than that .
okay .
so .
so it kind of keeps you sticking to the rules .
keeps ic you a lot more focused stuff on it .
okay .
sort of .
is it more challenging when you play a computer versus a person ?
well , it can be ic depending on the difficulty level i put rel it on .
okay .
so now tell me why you enjoy chess .
well i just it is ic sort of a social thing .
i li like ic playing .
and i occasionally win ic so .
i just like ic playing .
okay .
okay , so i'm not too familiar with the game of chess really , so i'm sure that you know a lot more than i do .
so i'd like for you to explain a few things to me , okay ?
okay .
first of all , how many people may play a game of chess at one time ?
two , one for each side .
and i've heard of simultaneous matches , do you know what that is ?
no , i do not think ic i have heard nom of that .
okay .
tell me about the different pieces in chess and how they are supposed to move .
the pawns are ic set up in front of all the other pieces .
they can ic only move one space .
and that is ic if it is adv their first move .
then they can move ic two spaces forward .
they can only move ic forward except when capturing .
they can only capture ic diagonally strangely enough .
and those are all the ones in the front row .
and when a pawn reaches adv the king row of the opposite side of the board , there is ic a pawn promotion .
and you can swap ic that pawn for any other piece , a knight , a bishop , a rook , queen .
and when you play adv on the compu computer it will , it will keep giving ic you any piece an even if you already have adv all of them .
so i have ended up ic with five queens .
okay .
so , what about the other pieces behind that row ?
in the corners there are ic the rooks , also called castles .
they can move ic only in a straight line , so along the ranks and files , or rows and columns .
okay .
and they capture ic straight , same way they move rel .
and next one in are ic the knights , the horses .
they move ic in an l fashion two up and one over or two over , one up in an l like that .
and they can pass ic through any pieces standing in in the way of that .
and they capture ic any any opposing piece that happens rel to be on the square that they are moving rel to .
you cannot move ic there if it is adv one of your own pieces .
so those are the knights ?
also the rooks did you call them ?
no that was the other one .
they are ic also called horses .
okay , and then what is after that ?
then the bishops , which are ic the tower things with a slit in them .
and they move ic only diagonally , and capture that way .
and then , next to them .
and then in the middle you have ic the king who can only move rel one space at a time , but he can move any direction , and the queen who can move rel any amount of spaces in any direction , making her the strongest piece on the board .
the queen ?
okay , so now tell me about the goals of chess , in other words , what are the players trying to do .
they are trying ic to put the opposing player's king in checkmate where wherever they move rel they will be nom in check or they are nom at risk of being captured .
so now tell me the rules that players need to follow , in other words , tell me everything you can think about the game of chess so that someone who has never played before would know how to play .
okay .
well i already told ic you how the pieces move nom .
well you can move ic unless you are adv in check .
and if you can move ic any piece you want to as long as there is adv not something hindering them like .
the knight is ic the only one that can move rel through other pieces .
so they can jump ic over the row of pawns first move and get in front .
but for a rook or a bishop you would have ic to move a pawn out of the way before you could move adv it out .
so there is ic one weak spot in the row of pawns which usually serves rel as the defense against kings and such .
there is ic weakness .
there is ic one pawn that is rel not protected by a rook or bishop or queen .
it is ic right in front of the bishop .
so the bishop could only move ic to the side of it .
it is ic right next to the king .
he is ic the only one that can capture rel the piece any piece that goes rel there .
and so that is ic part of a strategy that i use rel a lot .
it is ic a three move win .
so when you maneuver adv your queen , so that she can take adv that piece , before you do adv that , you have ic to have a bishop over here so it is adv on the same diagonal as that pawn so the queen cannot be taken adv .
and if you do adv that quick enough , your opponent will not have ic moved any pa pawns .
so the king will not have ic anywhere to move .
is that a strategy that a lot of kids your age know about ?
anyone who has played rel me knows ic about it .
and you can find ic it in pretty much any chess tutorial .
it is ic actually under advanced moves .
but it is ic a pretty easy thing .
okay .
so do you read up a lot on strategies ?
sometimes i take ic tutorials for refresher course or something .
all right , so let's see .
so now i would like you to tell me about what a player should do in order to win the game of chess , in other words , what are some key strategies that every good player should know .
and we sort of did that a little bit i guess , but are there some other , more basic strategies ?
or not basic .
well , i do not know ic about other players .
but since it is adv easy to block , if i can see adv that it is nom not going to work , then that strategy usually goes ic out the window .
and i just work up ic an idea when i see adv an opening .
and a lot of times in order to get a checkmate you will have ic to sacrifice .
so one piece will have ic to be taken in order for another piece to move in .
so .
well , then let's see moving on .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
my stra if my three move strategy works ic , about ten seconds .
if it does not work ic , anywhere from five minutes to an hour .
okay .
well i know ic that games have lasted nom a lot longer than that .
games that you have played yourself ?
not that i have played rel , but i know ic a lot more professional players .
their game can ic last three hours .
okay , but about an hour is your max ?
and what makes a game last a long time ?
if you are ic able to sense your opponent's strategy .
if you are ic cautious and do not do take reckless risks .
okay .
so what makes a game end quickly ?
if you can get ic your opponent to m move and keep a piece out of the way quick enough .
if you can cause adv an opening then you could begin ic to move the king .
and then your opponent would have ic to move something to block that .
and sometimes that would give ic you an opening to end the game real quick .
so , do you know how to use a chess clock ?
never heard ic of it .
no ?
okay , then i will not ask you to tell me about it .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess ?
i can only think ic of one , two kind of advanced moves i have not talked rel about .
okay , go ahead , tell me .
there is ic the castle where it involves nom the king and the rooks .
either the king or the rook can ic have moved through the whole game .
you can only do ic it once in the game .
each person can only do ic it once .
the pieces in between the rook , the bishop and knight , or if it is adv on the other side , the bishop , knight and queen have ic to be out of the way .
and then essentially the king and the rooks switch ic places .
but they are ic more condensed .
so instead of being over here they are ic right next to each other .
hmm .
but you cannot pull ic that off if you are adv in check .
i am ic not sure why .
it would ic be useful to do an ordinary check .
but you cannot ic .
the rule is ic you are nom not allowed to .
it is ic not that it is nom not possible .
it is ic just the rule .
, it is ic the rule .
okay .
and also , there is ic “en passant” .
it is ic a special move for pawns .
it is ic not all that helpful .
but it looks ic neat and can make you look more advanced than maybe you actually are nom .
if a a pawn has moved adv two spaces in one move , if you have adv a pawn that happens rel to be right next to it , your pawn can move ic behind it .
and it counts ic as a capture .
it captures ic that other pawn .
hmm , okay .
do you use that move very often ?
the chance to use it does not come ic up very often because your pawn has adv to move out a little way .
okay , interesting .
it makes me want to learn how to play chess again .
do you ever play in school at all , is it part of a class that you take ?
no .
no ?
okay .
all right , is there anything else you would like to tell me about chess ?
cannot think ic of anything .
are you and your brother the only ones who play in your family ?
no my cousins most of my cousins play ic chess .
most of them can ic beat me .
right now maybe , but keep at it , you'll get them .
okay , great .
well , thanks for talking with me today .
you have been very helpful .
okay .
and i have some things for you to say thanks .
one is a pen from the university of oregon and a gift certificate to dairy queen .
cool .
to say thanks because you really helped us out today .
all right , well enjoy the rest of your day and good luck with your chess .

it is ic a little story about him and his friend and stuff .
were you going to tell me about a movie too ?
shrek is ic a pretty popular movie .
it is ic about an ogre who gets rc friends with a talking donkey .
and it is ic like an adventure they do rc .

, it is ic a pretty good book .
so can you tell me about it ?
it is ic about a boy .
he get it tells ic you at the beginning of the book .
it kind of like starts ic out pretty interesting .
he tells ic you like what he does nom .
then he explains ic it all out .
like he he is ic just an ordinary boy .
his mom had ic died of cancer .
and his dad had ic left him before he knew avc him .
and he is ic kind of on his own with his uncle .
and i am ic not very far .
i think ic i am nom on page eight .
, that is ic how much i know nom so far .
it sounds like it is an interesting story .
it has grabbed your attention .
do you have any questions for me ?
now i would like to ask you some questions about chess .
okay .
how long have you played chess ?
for about , probably not even for a year .
and how old were you when you first started to play ?
i think ic i was nom ten .
and then my birthday was ic a month after that .
and who taught you to play chess ?
actually my little austin did ic .
my little brother taught ic me how to play chess , .
do you have a chess rating ?
no , not really .
it is nom probably average i think ic .
i am ic not exactly positive .
have you played in a chess tournament ?
no .
do you have a chess coach or a teacher ?
yes i have ic a chess teacher .
and he is ic running a program at our school that i take rc part in .
he gives us we just play ic a game of chess .
and he gives ic us the option of either playing a game of chess or learning a lesson .
i usually do ic the lessons because i like to figure avc out more interesting stuff .
i think ic there is nom only one time that i have rc not done the lesson .
and i think ic i have had nom two different chess teachers .
one was ic moving or going somewhere .
and then the other one came ic .
but , , i have ic a chess teacher .
can you tell me any more about him ?
not really i am ic not exactly sure about his personal life .
do you belong to a chess club ?
which one ?
is there a name ?
no , not really just my teachers and my friends and principal , pretty much everyone at my school calls ic it just chess club .
how often do you play chess in a typical week ?
maybe two times , three times .
who do you play with most ?
usually my friends and my brother .
there is ic only one other friend that i have rc that is rc in chess club right now .
, i have played ic him like four times i think , maybe .
and my brother , he is ic really good .
and i do not think ic i could probably win nom him once .
i think ic i have nom .
but he was ic really really tired .
it was ic kind of not fair .
can you name any famous chess players ?
no .
do you ever play chess on a computer ?
yes , austin has gotten ic two different types of chess p c games .
and i sometimes go ic on there and play .
it is ic kind of for his age not mine .
the knights are ic horses .
and they have ic wings and stuff .
and there is ic like little people , kind of mystical , midevil stuff .
, it is ic pretty fun .
it is ic just kind of hard to get used to the pieces because the pieces look avc different .
but you kind of get ic to pick what your guy looks nom like .
and then you just play ic .
do you like playing on the computer ?
, it is ic fun .
but i would rather play ic not on a computer but with other people because you know avc the computer .
like you choose ic your skill level .
and they never get better ic .
it just stays ic like that .
it tells ic you to pick an age level that you are rc at in like .
in like two years i will still be playing ic chess .
and i will be ic a lot better than that .
i think ic you can create nom more people .
but , pretty good game .
now tell me why you enjoy chess .
i think ic , it is nom a complicated game .
i like ic games that are rc .
you know ic you can easily get used nom to chess .
but it takes ic a while to get used to how much pieces are nom worth and what exactly pieces can do nom .
and it is ic a nice easy right in their game .
and it is ic totally enjoyable .
you know ic most people play nom it .
and it is ic checkers that is rc just a simple easy game .
and it does not take long ic .
but chess , you know , a nice simple game .
please explain a few things about chess to me .
first of all how many people can play a game of chess at one time .
two people can ic .
there's ic some games they have made up rc like bug house in that game at one time .
, i do not know ic any other games that play rc with more people .
i have heard of simultaneous matches .
do you know there that is ?
no .
tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move .
there are ic pawns .
there's ic a rooks .
there's ic two rooks , two bishops , and a queen and two knights .
and the pawns can only attack ic diagonally .
they are ic allowed to move two spaces forward their first turn all of them .
and they can keep on moving ic forward .
if you get avc a pawn to the end of the area , and you lose avc your rook or a queen , you get ic a queen or a rook back .
and then there is the rook ic .
the rook can move ic forward , that way .
and it can get ic around everywhere of the board .
and it is ic the black line eight pawns in one row .
and you can not move ic any other pieces until your pawns go avc .
, and then there is ic the bishop .
the bishop can only move ic diagonally .
each bishop is ic on like a white square .
and one is ic on a black square or whatever squares there are rc .
and the so they can each move ic diagonally .
and then there is ic the knight which can only move rc in an l shape , three squares forward and one square over .
they can move ic area that way .
and they can only attack ic .
the knight is ic actually the only piece that can jump rc over one piece .
and so they can only attack on one square .
so if you were moving avc in an l shape and a pawn was avc right here , you would just jump ic over the pawn .
then there is ic the queen .
the queen can move ic in any direction in any spaces it wants .
so it can move ic forward , diagonally etc .
the king can only move ic one square at a time .
and can not get , you know you kind of can not get ic him lost because if you get avc him lost the game is nom over and the other opponent wins nom .
and , that is ic all the pieces .
and i think ic there is nom a different amount for every pieces .
like the pawn is ic worth one point .
the rook is ic worth five .
the bishop is ic worth five .
and then a knight is ic worth three .
and the king is ic worth however much it wants nom because once you get avc him the game is nom over .
and then the queen is ic worth eleven .
, that is ic pretty much it .
what do you use the points for ?
the points , i am ic not exactly sure .
but in some games , they might want ic to keep track of the points .
sometimes you could get ic your king just like that .
or sometimes you get ic most of the other pieces out before you get avc your king .
so because it is ic just a way of keeping track of how good you are nom and how fast you can nom do it .
now tell me the goals of chess .
in other words what are the players trying to do ?
the players are trying ic to get the king in checkmate .
checkmate is ic when the king cannot move nom any square without being attacked .
and there is ic a stalemate in which you do not want nom to get in .
stalemate means ic it is nom a draw .
and checkmate means ic the game is nom automatically over .
if you get avc in a stalemate , it is ic like the king is being attacked from every square .
i'm ic not exactly sure .
but i think ic that is nom what it nom is .
so you are ic kind of trying to get the king trapped in an area so you can take nom it and it cannot move nom anywhere .
and you one of the good strategies that i found rc that most people do rc is ic that they move nom their knights out first .
and i guess ic that kind of controls nom the middle of the area .
you kind of want ic to get most of the pieces taken out so you can get avc your opponents king .
now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
in other words , tell me everything you can think about the game of chess so that someone who has never played before would know how to play .
okay , well there are simple rules ic .
and there's ic more rules that i'm rc not sure that i know nom all of them .
but the simple rules are ic you know nom .
there is ic something called castling .
it is ic when you trade nom spaces with your rook and your king .
and if you are in check avc you can not do ic that .
and if you move avc your rook , and then go avc back , you can not do ic the castling move .
and you can only move ic your pawns twice .
that is ic kind of a rule .
and if your king is avc in check you have ic to make sure that he cannot if there is avc an open space that he can move nom to because if he is avc your only piece , you have nom to move him .
and that is ic what you want nom to do .
you want ic to get every other piece so that is avc one of the only pieces that he can move rc .
and the bishops you can only move ic diagonally .
and the rooks , there are ic different ways to get queens .
like say you had , , if you got , if you already had avc a queen , and you got avc your pawn all the way to the end of the board , you could turn ic the rooks sideways .
you could put ic the castle upside down .
and it becomes ic a queen .
and i think that was two ways that was ic a little more extreme rule that i did not learn rc until later .
and you kind of have to make sure ic you can move nom in the right direction .
make sure it is legal .
and that is ic pretty much it .
so you turn the rook upside down ?
the rook .
if you replace , get a pawn on the other side of the board ?
the pawn , if you get avc the pawn , you can turn ic it sideways .
so it is ic leaning just like you know staying there and then the rook , upside down .
and it becomes a queen .
now i would like you tell me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess .
in other words what are some key strategies that every good player should know ?
well if you are playing avc against someone easy , it would be ic pretty easy to do .
one of the things i do rc is ic i do not move nom the pieces that are rc in front of the king and queen because that leaves avc them open .
so i move ic the pieces out more , close to the side .
and you kind of want ic one of the first open areas to try to win the game is nom when all the pieces around the king have not been avc moved yet .
so say ic a piece was forced nom to move forward to you know to protect a different one .
you kind of want ic to get into position .
like say ic you moved nom your pawn and then your other pawn like one two and then one one .
that leaves ic an open bishop area for it to attack .
and so you kind of want ic to get that in where though the king can not move nom any direction except forward .
and you want ic to try to get your rook moved out .
and there is ic there .
before you take avc a piece , like if there was avc a bishop rook right here , and you kind of make sure ic because there is avc a strategy that you can do rc to try to get a king in checkmate with two rooks .
and , a rook is ic kind of a piece that you want rc to get out first .
and so say ic that you had nom a pawn next to the rook and you had nom a bishop that could attack rc you .
you would kind of want ic to go with the bishop or if there is avc another piece because if you take avc that rook up the pawn might get nom you .
so you are ic kind of wasting a piece to get it .
so you want ic to take a piece that is rc not worth much more points .
and then the way the strategy to get a king without two rooks you kind of want ic to move it one area .
so it has ic to move back because it is avc taking control of that whole area .
so the king has to move back ic .
then you kind of want ic to move your other rook .
you want ic to keep on doing that until he gets avc back to the last square .
and then move ic him in a certain position .
and he is ic in checkmate .
and there's those are ic the main ones i use rc when i try to win avc the game .
but i do not know ic about any other people's ways to try to win .
like there is ic a way to protect .
it is ic a pretty good strategy that i learned rc from one of the chess player by watching him play .
if you know ic how i am saying ic one of the good strategies is nom to move your knights out first .
the two pawns you might want ic to move that are rc in front of the king and queen forward two because that leaves avc every move .
like i was ic going against him .
every piece i moved rc , he could get ic with either the knights or the pawns .
so , i found ic out that was nom a very good strategy and .
that is ic pretty much all of the ones i know rc .
so you said that moving the king forward is a good strategy .
moving the king away from the back of the board , is that the strategy ?
, with your rooks .
you want ic to try to get him to the back of the board of your opponents king to try to get him in checkmate .
so do you move your king from the back row .
is it good to move the king forward .
not really , if he is avc in checkmate and he is avc in check and there is ic a piece right there .
he might have ic to take that piece to get out of check .
but as soon as you do avc that you want ic to move back because you do not want avc him open and out in the area to be attacked so .
, you kind of want ic to keep him covered back .
and if sometimes your queen is ic one of the best pieces you want rc to move out first or any chance you have rc because she can take avc out of different pieces easily , like that .
and if you have avc the other opponents queen , you want to take out ic the pawns so the pawns cannot get avc the queen back .
and , so you kind of want ic to keep your king back and with your rooks , to force the king back because he can not move avc forward .
he can move ic side .
but if he does avc that , if he moves avc sideways when you have avc it right there , you want ic to move your other piece right there so he has avc to move back and then continue the pattern till he is avc back in the last square .
there is ic a lot to learn about chess .
it sounds complex .
how long does it take to play a game of chess .
maybe twenty to thirty minutes .
what makes a game last a long time ?
when you are ic two equal people .
when you both know ic the strategies .
because you can move avc pieces and you can move avc pieces to attack but they get ic token like that .
and then the same thing happens ic to the other opponents .
that is ic what makes nom a game really long .
and when a game is avc really short , it is ic like when you play avc someone younger than you or had not had much experience in playing chess .
that is ic when the game is avc you know probably ten minutes long .
so , what makes a game end quickly ?
when you are playing ic someone easier .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
no but i have seen ic like in movies they have nom like chess tournaments .
and i think ic every time you move nom one of your pieces , like the other opponent i think , will click nom theirs once they are done moving avc .
and then yours starts ic .
and you have to click ic it when your move avc .
so i think ic you have a certain nom amount of time before .
like if you run out avc of time and i think ic the game might be nom a draw or over .
, i am ic not completely sure about how to use a chess clock .
is there anything else you would like to tell me about chess ?
no , not really .
thank you for talking today .
do you have any brothers or sisters ?

anything more you can tell me about thomas ?
he started playing i knew ic him when i was avc first born because he was playing avc with my older brother , christian .
and that is ic all i know rc .
and he still lives ic with his parents .
anything else .
do you have a chess rating ?
i am ic first in club so far .

he beat ic me just barely .
and that is ic all .
do you belong to a chess club ?
yes .
do you have a chess coach or teacher ?
, i have ic a chess teacher .
but i do not know ic his name though because he is avc new .
our old teacher had ic to move .
, i learned ic a lot from him .
can you tell me any more about him ?
he is ic usually late .
and he has taught ic me a game .
it is ic bughouse .
it is ic when you are nom on a team .
and if you take avc somebody's , if your partner takes avc somebody else's piece , you get it ic .
and if you take avc somebody else's piece you give ic them that piece to them .
and they get ic to set it up anywhere else .
they can set ic anywhere on the board they want rc except it has nom to be on their side and the pawns cannot be nom on the back .
anything else ?
how often do you play chess ?
about everyday .
so , who do you play with the most .
my brother , taylor .
can you name any famous chess players ?
i do not think ic so .
okay do you ever play chess on a computer ?
yes i got ic chess master , the tenth editions .
and it is ic pretty challenging .
and i have ic battle chess iii .
and it is ic three d when you have nom acutally these real , war pieces that you move rc .
and you can actually make ic them fight .
it is ic pretty cool .
so next .
how often do you play on the computer ?
about everyday .
so you play a computer everyday and you also play a person .
so you play everyday .
now tell me why you enjoy chess .
it is ic a pretty challenging sport .
and you have to know ic a bunch of strategies to basically know how to play .
and it is ic really fun to challenge people because you have to use avc a bunch of mathematics .
so you like to use mathematics when you play .
i am not too familiar with the game of chess .
you probably know a lot more about it than i do .
so i would like you to explain some things to me .
first of all , how many people may play a game of chess at one time ?
four is ic the most .
four is the most .
i have heard of simultaneous matches .
do you know what that is ?
no .
tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move .
the pawns on their first move they can move ic twice .
but they can only move ic forward .
or if there is avc a pieces diagonal one square away from them , they can take ic it .
and the knights can only move ic l shape when they are moving avc three squares .
and the queen can move ic anywhere it wants rc in any direction as much as it wants avc .
king is ic the most important piece .
and if you get avc that taken , or if you can not move avc anywhere , it is ic game .
and he can only move ic one time unless he does avc this move with it .
it is ic called castling .
and it is ic when the king moves nom twice sideways and the castle moves nom over it .
and then the castle can move ic only straight sideways as much as it wants avc until something blocks avc it .
the bishop can only move ic diagonal as much as it wants avc until it hits avc the edge of the board or something blocks avc it .
and these are ic all the moves a piece on the board can do rc .
now tell me about the goals of chess .
in other words what are the player trying to do ?
the players are trying ic to defeat get all of your pieces or make it so you can not so the king can't block nom the check or check mate him with a couple different pieces .
and that is ic the goals that you kind of want rc to do for chess .
the goal is to stay out of check .
i would like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess .
in other words , what are some key strategies that every good player should know .
usually the first three moves you want rc to do is ic either open nom a space for your king in case he gets avc in check he can move nom somewhere else .
and you should always get ic your knights out first to control the middle of the board .
and you should get ic your knights and bishop out and the pawns out first .
and those are ic some of the strategies that you usually want rc to do and matters of chess game .
can you say why you put bishops out first ?
you can usually control ic the board and somebody moves .
if somebody move avc somewhere you could take ic them no matter if you have nom to .
and that is why ic .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess .
about fifteen or ten .
or if you are equally matched avc it usually takes ic a half an hour .
so that is ic how long it usually takes nom to a play a game of chess .
what make a game last a long time ?
if you are ic equally matched and there is nom only your rook and your rook and king versus a king .
that takes ic a while or for a king to take a while .
for each for each player to only have their king left and that is ic called stalemate .
and it takes ic a while because one person might have avc two other pieces and you can only take avc it with your king .
so that is ic it .
and what make a game end quickly ?
if you move avc one piece three times in the same directions it is ic a tie .
i found ic out if you move avc your queen right in front of the king and then move a pawn it is nom checkmate because they can't block avc it .
and that is ic a way how i usually end nom the game quickly .
that is ic how you end nom the game quickly .
can you explain that again .
put ic the queen right in front of the king so he can not take avc it and he can't block avc it .
and that is ic a checkmate .
and that ends ic the game quickly .
and a tie , that is ic when you move nom your piece one square then back three times in a row without them getting in check .
and that is ic a tie .
and that is ic how games usually end nom quickly .
thanks for helping us .
before we talk about chess , i would like to learn something about you .
i am going to ask you a few general questions and you can ask me some questions if you want .

, i can not really think ic of one .
do you want to ask me anything ?
no .
now i am going to ask you some questions about chess .
how long have you played chess ?
i am ic not sure , maybe two years , three years .
how old were you when you first started to play ?
around eleven or ten .
who taught you to play chess ?
i think ic my dad , and a little bit at school .
do you have a chess rating ?
what do you mean ic ?
when you go to tournaments you get a ranking or a rating .
no .
do you have a chess coach or teacher ?
no .
do you belong to a chess club ?
, here at school .
what is the name of it ?
i do not know ic .
there is no name ?
just chess club ?
, just the chess club .
so in the chess club there is no one who gives you any kind of instruction ?
, miss mix .
so she is kind of like a coach or teacher .
, i guess ic .
she could be ic .
how often do you play chess , say in a typical week ?
i do not know ic , maybe once , twice , three times .
so one to three times a week .
who do you play with the most ?
normally at school , i do not know ic a lot of names .
there are ic a lot of people in the chess club .
so normally in chess club i play ic , or my dad .
your dad or someone in the chess club .
or sister sometimes .
which sister do you play ?
the little one , carly .
really .
is she pretty good ?
not really .
she is ic getting better though .
she knows ic all the moves and all that but .
you are ic trying to teach her ?
so you don't have a buddy that you play chess with from the chess club ?
i have ic a friend bryan that plays rel .
but i have not played ic him in a while though .
i do not think ic there is nom anybody in the chess club .
so he is in the chess club ?
no he is ic not .
can you name any famous chess player ?
not really , no .
do you ever play chess on a computer ?
yes .
can you tell me how that works ?
it is ic hard .
but i do not know ic really .
what do you mean ic by how it works nom ?
well , i mean i have never played chess on a computer .
, it is ic normal .
but it is ic sometimes harder than usual because the computer is adv pretty good .
i have played ic at school and at my friend's house sometimes .
i do not have ic it on my computer .
but , , it is ic hard .
now tell me why you enjoy chess .
i do not really know ic .
i just think ic it is nom fun to play it , to get better at it .
so you feel that you are getting better with each game ?
what do you think helps you get better ?
i do not know ic .
like learning new moves like learning new ways to trick people .
learning new ways .
to play .
i am not too familiar with the game of chess .
you probably know more about it than i do .
so i would like you to explain some things to me .
okay .
first of all , how many people may play a game of chess at one time ?
two .
i have heard of simultaneous matches .
do you know what that is .
no .
tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move .
okay a horse or a knight can move ic in like an l shape .
i think ic it is nom like two up and one over or one up and two over .
and then a pawn can move ic .
on its first move it can move ic two or one in any other way .
so it can only go ic in one direction .
but it attacks ic diagonal like when it takes adv out another piece .
it has ic a radius of one .
and it can only go ic forward .
and then a queen can go ic in any direction , forward , diagonal , backwards , side to side .
a castle can move ic straight in a any direction except diagonal .
so it can go ic straight forward , side , back to back , all that .
and then bishop can only go ic diagonal .
and then a king can only move ic one in any direction .
and that is ic kind of all .
is that everything ?
now tell me about the goals of chess .
in other words , what are the players trying to do ?
trying ic to get the opponent's king in checkmate where no matter where it moves adv it will die nom by a piece .
you could say ic die .
so like where ever it moves adv , a piece could still get ic it , take it out or whatever .
so that is ic the main point .
some people think ic it is nom to take out all the pieces .
but that is ic not what i try nom to do .
you focus on just getting the king .
yes , that is ic what i try nom and do .
now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
in other words , tell me everything that you can think about the game of chess so that someone who has never played before , would know how to play .
well , how the pieces move ic .
you need to know ic that .
and then there are ic two things like castling where you can move nom your king two to the right and castle one to the left of the king if they have not been moved adv , either piece .
and then there is ic check , where your king gets nom in a spot where it can get knocked nom out .
you have ic to move it or do something where it is nom no longer in check because checkmate is adv where it can not move nom anywhere .
and check is ic where you have nom to move it one .
there , if you get adv a pawn all the way to the end , you can switch ic it out for another piece .
like if you lose adv a piece , you can switch ic it out for another piece .
like if you lose adv your queen , you can switch ic it out for a new queen .
i do not know ic a lot about that .
i do not know ic how many queens you can get nom or if you can only get nom one .
i do not know ic .
i think ic that is nom it .
why would a player not move their king if they were in check ?
they would have ic to .
well no , they would not have ic to because if they can move adv a piece in front of it , in front of the piece that is rel getting them in check , then you could do nom that .
you do not always have ic to move the king .
so .
so you can block .
, you can pretty much block ic .
but the knights you cannot block ic them .
they can jump ic over any piece .
that is ic another thing .
and they are ic the only piece that can rel do that .
so like the pawns start ic out in front .
the knight is ic the only one that can move rel out .
otherwise you are going ic to have to move the pawns out of the way to get any other piece out .
so you can not really block ic a knight .
so they are a dangerous piece .
i do not like ic them that much but .
now i would like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess .
in other words what are some key strategies that every good player should know .
i try ic to do this thing .
when i get adv a king in check , i have ic a piece that is rel guarding that one piece .
so if a piece takes adv out the piece that has rel the king in check , i can take ic out that piece .
so if i had adv like a castle and a bishop up here , which is rel the one that can move rel on a diagonal , i can kind of like protect ic it .
so if a king took adv it out , it could not ic because the castle could take adv the king out .
and you cannot move ic yourself into check .
so that is ic what i try nom and do , protect your pieces that try rel to get your king .
so to make sure i understand you , you have the king and you have some piece blocking it .
you make them pay .
are there other strategies that you use ?
no .
some people think ic .
well it is ic kind of an opinion , a queen for a queen .
some people it is ic like their choice .
like i usually do not do ic a queen for queen .
what do you mean queen for queen ?
like if there is adv a queen and a queen , you can take ic out that queen .
and then you lose ic your queen .
that is ic queen for queen .
i usually do not do ic that .
but some people like ic to do that .
why would they like to do that ?
because the other person loses ic their queen too .
some people , i do not know some people without their queen they are ic worthless really .
like i do not use ic my queen as long as i have adv my two castles .
you save your queen for ?
i usually do not use ic my queen that much until at the end when they do not have adv any pieces left because it has got adv a really far radius .
it is ic the best piece so .
so do you have any other strategies ?
well my personal strategy is ic taking out the rooks which is rel the castles .
that is ic what i do nom .
take out ic their castles because that is adv what i use nom .
and you find that is effective ?
yes .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
i do not know ic .
i have not really kept track ic .
they can go ic on for like ever and ever but maybe thirty minutes to an hour .
i do not know ic .
but normally about thirty minutes and probably like ten at the minimum .
what makes a game last a long time ?
two really good opponents like two really good people playing each other .
what is the longest game you have ever played ?
maybe like an hour and a half maybe longer .
you were pretty evenly matched .
well my dad , so actually i was ic kind of the underdog .
but it lasted ic really long .
what makes a game end quickly ?
when a really good player is ic playing not a very good player or something .
like when you have ic a really easy opponent that does not .
someone that is ic distracted or something .
someone that is ic not really paying attention that much , like if they are not paying adv attention .
and you have got ic someone like way across the board and move it all the way in check .
they can not really see ic that well if they are not paying adv attention .
because you kind of got ic to check the whole board at all times .
or you will lose ic .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
not really .
kind of but i have never used ic one .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess ?
protect ic your queen and castles really .
that is ic all .
that is ic really all .
thank you again for talking with me today .
i can't tell you how much i appreciate your agreeing to talk with me today .

have you read the books , even though you don't like them ?
no .
the first ones i thought they did a better job of getting right to the .
, , i read ic those ones .

not car chases .
what's the last movie you saw that you really liked ?
i do not remember ic the last time i watched rel a movie .
maybe you don't like action movies anymore , maybe you like chess movies .
now , i want you to explain chess .
can you do that ?
can you try ?
i am going to ask you some questions to start you off .
i need ic a chess board to do that .
well , just try to figure it out .
i know what a chess board looks like , with the blacks and the reds .
and it's , what , twelve squares across the top ?
eight .
eight by eight .
how many people play chess , just two ?
, two at a time .
what about simultaneous matches ?
have you ever seen that ?
what happens with that ?
one guy goes ic around and plays all the boards against lots of people .
have you been in any kind of tournament like that ?
not in tournaments but just for fun .
for practice ?
who does that , your coach ?
yup .
which one ?
colin and chuck .
they both do ?
yup .
what is that , what is a simultaneous match ?
just one guy walks ic around and plays on all the boards .
how many boards at once usually ?
matters ic how many you want nom to play .
what happens to the people he comes by and does something on your board and then you're ready , but he's not there .
you have to wait till he comes back ?
do you usually have a move real quick , or do you does it take you some time to figure out ?
well , it always takes ic some time to figure out .
tell me about the different pieces .
now i know there's pawns , right ?
those are lined up on the inside row , right ?
on the outside .
checkers i'd be better at .
you can tell sue all about it , because she really doesn't know how to play .
why don't you tell her all the details , okay , mason ?
okay .
well , on the pawn's first move , before they ever move adv , they can move ic two spaces .
or they can move ic one .
okay .
but once they do adv the first two , if they do adv , then they can only move ic one from now on .
okay , so if they move one , they can still only move one ?
yes , but on the first move , you can move ic two .
okay .
how do you know if you're going to move them one or two ?
you just think ic which one would nom be better .
okay , and then what ?
a pawn can attack ic diagonally one square .
not like in checkers .
okay , what's behind the pawns ?
pieces .
kings , queens , bishops , knights , and rooks .
in that order ?
no .
rooks on the side , then a knight , then a bishop .
and then a king or a queen .
it matters ic what color you are nom .
what's the better color ?
is there a better color ?
white .
they go first ?
who decides who goes first ?
white goes ic first .
that is ic how the rules are nom .
how do you decide who's white ?
the tournament decides ic that .
what if you're just playing with your friend ?
do you hide them behind your back ?
no , i just let ic them be white because i know adv i can beat nom them normally .
when you're playing chess , what would your goals be ?
what are you trying to do ?
checkmate the guy .
how do you do that ?
you make sure ic the king can not move nom anywhere .
you check them ic .
and you can not take ic it or block the piece that has checked rel them .
did you guys talk about all the pieces and how they all move ?
no , we didn't .
go back then .
a knight can move ic two squares forward and then one square to the right or left .
and it can move ic two squares any direction , long as not off the board , and one left or right .
kind of an l shape ?
and a rook can move ic horizontal or straight .
and the bishop unintelligible ?
, it can just goes ic diagonally .
, , and a knight can jump ic over the king .
what about the king and queen ?
the king can move ic one square in any direction .
a queen can move ic any square to as far as it wants adv , any direction .
except it can not jump ic over pieces .
it can't jump ?
yup , it can not jump ic over pieces .
but it can move diagonally ?
, and horizontal .
can it do the same moves as a .
rook and a bishop .
, but not like a not like a knight , though .
yup , it is ic not like a knight .
and the king ?
can move ic any direction , one square .
so that's why it's easy to get it checkmated ?
well .
it's not that easy ?
no , because they guard ic the king with their queen .
what's the most important piece ?
the queen .
because she can move in so many ways ?
yup .
so when you're playing , now , you said you want to have checkmate .
but do you kind of want to get the queen if you can ?
is that something you try to do ?
no , because they normally guard ic the queen mostly they mistaken , mistaken the .
they keep her out of danger .
yup .
how do they do that the other pieces ?
the queen goes ic behind the pawns .
like alice in wonderland , off with their heads ?
yup .
so tell me about the rules .
we're starting .
white goes ic first .
okay , so i'm white .
okay .
do i take one of my pawns ?
or you can move ic your knight .
, because he can jump over the pawns ?
yup .
so which one do i want to do ?
moving your pawns first is ic normally the unintelligible .
do i start in the middle or do i start on the sides ?
middle .
why ?
because it is ic better to control the middle instead of the side of the board .
i think i know that .
so then one how close am i to the other side ?
four squares apart .
if i move up two .
he moves ic up two .
and they can not move ic at each other .
they are ic just like stuck .
so we're stuck .
yup .
so i move two and he moves two , and we're all stuck down the board ?
well , that is ic impossible .
it is ?
why ?
unless the both of the people work ic together to do that .
so i move my guy out two , and then what do you do ?
i move ic my guy out two , right across from your guy .
facing me ?
maybe we should have you be going first , then what do you do ?
say you're white .
you moved your guy out twice and i moved my guy out two , now what ?
i move ic my knight to attack your pawn .
, how do you know you could reach my pawn ?
to attack your pawn , not take it .
so how would you attack it ?
i would move ic two forward , then one up .
one you're right , we need a board .
so how far are you , then , from my pawn ?
i am moving ic forward two squares and moving back .
so you're like right next to me pretty much ?
i am ic two squares away and to the left .
unintelligible .
unintelligible .
, all right , so we're kind of getting back on that now you know i don't know how to play , so what would you tell me so that i'd be prepared , so i'm not just sitting around going “why did you move that guy” ?
i need ic a chess board .
well , picture it in your mind .
the question is ic , can you picture nom it in your mind ?
i'll try .
the objective is ic to move your pawns up in the opening .
okay , then what ?
get your pawn try ic to control the center by the opening .
get ic development .
that is moving ic your pieces out .
like getting the knight out .
okay , and then what ?
then it is ic the middle game .
and you are mainly trying ic to checkmate the person .
or you are trying ic to go for an endgame .
if you make adv it to the endgame , you are trying ic to promote your pawn , if you have adv a pawn .
or you are trying ic to make the person .
how do you promote the pawn ?
it can get ic to the last rank .
and it can turn ic into any piece besides the queen no besides the king .
if i get him to your side there , then he can be a different piece .
okay , which is the best piece ?
the queen .
so you can have two queens ?
serious ?
is that basically what i need to know if i want to play you ?
well , that is ic just the basic principles .
what are some other things to tell her ?
what if it's someone who's never played before ?
what else could you tell her unintelligible ?
the queen is ic worth nine in points .
the rook is ic worth five points .
knights and bishops are ic worth three points .
and kings are ic worth four points or more where people save nom the game .
now you've just told me something i don't think i ever knew before .
there's points in chess .
well , it is ic how much the pieces are worth .
if you take them .
okay .
the points do not do ic anything they're .
i thought it was just basically taking pieces until you got down to the king .
i didn't know you could add up points , that's very interesting .
so is there a score you have to try to reach ?
no , you just try ic to checkmate the guy .
so why do you have points ?
just to help you rank the system for new players .
hmm , i'm confused , how does that work ?
like a person will not want ic to trade his queen for a pawn because the queen is adv worth nine points and the pawn is adv worth one .
it is ic just like a ranking system .
did you ever play five minute chess ?
not very often .
what if what if you're in a situation where you just have so much time , and you don't check each other , then do the points matter ?
well , .
can you tell us about that ?
it is ic the same reason .
it is ic the ranking system , to help know what the piece is nom worth .
now , i've talked to some people who tell me about that there's certain kinds of strategies , certain ways you can play , certain things you try to do when you're playing chess .
do you have certain strategies you like to use ?
, but they are ic not explainable .
try , i want to hear about it .
i really do not know ic how to explain .
what's the name of one strategy ?
what can you say about en passant ?
is that a strategy ?
no , it is ic just a move .
that's a move .
a pawn can go ic two squares .
and if a pawn is adv right next to it , the pawn can take ic it .
if the pawn just moved adv two squares above where yours is rel , and you move adv the two squares , he can attack ic you diagonally and take your pawn unintelligible .
unintelligible couldn't do that .
i've heard of a strategy of trying to get to the center of the board .
is that a good strategy ?
, in the opening .
tell us about that unintelligible .
get ic your knights out to how far in the center as possible , and your bishops .
you try ic and control the squares near it .
now is that what you called the middle game ?
no , that is ic the opening .
so what's the middle when do you get to the middle game ?
it's like the twelfth through fifteenth or it can start ic from the twelfth or the fifteenth move or in between that .
how do you know when you've gotten to that point ?
is it after all the pawns are moved unintelligible ?
like all the pieces are ic out , or most of them .
and they're all moving around on the board , things are happening .
so how long does it usually take you to play a game ?
matters ic what the time control is nom .
, do you sometimes have set times ?
normally .
you play with a clock ?
how does that work ?
they have ic special clocks where both sides have nom a timer .
you press ic one side of it like a button .
and it activates ic the other side clock to go and turns off that clock .
it has ic a button in the middle of the clock .
do you have a limited amount of time to make a move ?
, or no , not move , to play the game for your side .
so that's what unintelligible you were saying about a five minute game ?
can we talk a little more about the strategies ?
is there another one ?
you explained that really well .
you did explain that really well .
unintelligible that was about getting the pieces in the center of the board .
what were the other ones ?
can you think of one more strategy ?
in the middle game , either trying to attack the person or defend yourself against the attack .
what would you defend yourself from ?
put ic your pieces around your king and guard the squares that they are rel attacking .
unintelligible .
coughing .
what about endgame strategies ?
to promote your pawn .
tell me about that .
getting your pawn to the last row .
okay , and then it can be another piece ?
unintelligible .
a queen .
, can you have anything you want ?
besides the king and pawn .
, that would be dumb , wouldn't it ?
they have a lot less power .
did you ever do that ?
, when it is ic possible .
but normally games do not have ic an endgame .
you don't it doesn't get that far , because you check someone ?
checkmate .
unintelligible .
how many moves till you get to an endgame if you don't have check ?
you mean ic checkmate .
because you said a middle game is twelve to fifteen moves ?
no , it starts ic at twelve , thirteen , fourteen , or fifteen .
right .
then it can go ic on forever .
so you could end a game in the middle game .
, that is ic what normally happens nom .
so what how do you get to the endgame ?
how do you know you're there ?
there are ic not that many pawns on the board , or pieces , like only two or three pieces and normal like four to six pawns or if there is adv one person losing badly .
now you this is a game where you have to think ahead , right , and you have to try to guess what the other person would be doing ?
is that how you would either attack , or to defend you want to try to figure out what is happening .
how many moves ahead do you try to plan ?
normally not that many because i use ic plans .
plans ?
, i find ic a goal that i want rel to do .
then i just find ic moves to get there .
how hard is it if somebody does something that you don't expect , and you have to change your mind plan ?
i just make ic a new plan .
so what , how sometimes games can be very long , though , right ?
bobby fischer , i remember , played for .
didn't they play for a couple of days ?
unintelligible what's the longest it can go on ?
as long as the time control is ic .
what's the shortest it could be ?
the time control .
what is the , what is the unintelligible ?
one person messing up , or the time control being ic really low .
how would they mess up ?
like get ic checkmated in two moves by moving the pawn up and then the other pawn up .
other person moves ic one pawn and the queen and checkmate them .
has that ever happened to you when you're playing ?
unless i can teach ic them how to get checkmated like that .
you'd be tough to play .
it would be hard to beat you .
okay , so tell us about the chess clock .
what else ?
you know what , what's a blunder ?
it is ic just a mistake .
how do you , how do you unintelligible .
like you lose ic the queen .
now that would be a big blunder .
but why do they call it a blunder ?
i don't know ic why .
like “duh , ” that sort of thing ?
unintelligible .
unintelligible i'd be so embarrassed if i did that .
so that'd be the kind of thing where you weren't seeing that you moved a piece unintelligible .
what else what else would i need to know ?
obviously , it would be better for me to play with somebody who's better than i am , right , because that's how i'd learn .
well , not too better .
not too much better , because then , why ?
you are ic going to get beat .
i'd get beat .
normally that is ic what happens nom to people .
and the person beating me is bored , right ?
so how do i get better ?
what do i do ?
puzzles , learn ic strategies from your coaches , and just practice .
puzzles like the ones in the newspaper ?
no , they have ic like chess puzzles that what is nom your best for this position .
have you seen the ones in the newspaper unintelligible ?
how do you , what is the do you know the markings , the notations ?
how does that work ?
you have ic like a , b , c , d , e , f , g , h long , so eight letters long and then one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight tall .
okay .
so you write ic what square they are nom lined up with .
like you call ic them four .
, okay .
is that algebraic notation ?
, they just call ic it notation .
let me ask you , do you know what a sicilian defense is ?
what is that ?
it is ic when you move nom your pawn to four and they already have nom their pawn to four .
and then they move ic their knight to f three .
and then you move ic your pawn to three .
and they move ic their pawn to four .
and you take ic the pawn .
unintelligible , does that help you win ?
no , it just gets ic you a better pawn structure .
what other things like that are there that you can do ?
you mean ic openings ?
is that an opening , the sicilian defense ?
what else is there ?
the yugoslav attack is ic a kind of unintelligible called a variation .
the bishop's opening .
i do not know ic most of the names .
i just know ic how to play them .
what one do you use mostly ?
the sicilian defense or the bishop's opening .
how does the bishop's opening go ?
four , five , then the bishop goes ic to four .
and that is ic all .
do you usually win when you play people ?
well , if it is adv games for fun , we will play ic in ten minutes , half and half .
have you played in any serious tournaments , like in portland ?
unintelligible .
no , it has been ic a couple of weeks .
how'd you do in your last tournament ?
i lost ic two games and won one .
were they kids your age , older ?
one kid my age and two kids older .
did you gain rating points ?
no .
i guess you have to win most of your games .
yup .
sounds like you're doing really well with chess .
yup .
unintelligible is there anything else you want to tell us about chess ?
nope .
do you have a chess set ?
yup .
is it a special one ?
the pieces are ic red and white .
the black pieces are ic red .
are they wood or plastic ?
plastic and it is ic double weighted .
what does that mean , it's heavier on the bottom ?
, they put lead inside of them so it doesn't get knocked over easily .
cool , sounds great .
thank you so much .
you really had a lot to tell me and i learned a lot .
you are ic welcome .
and next time i ever play , they'll be surprised .
i have for you a uo pen if you like it , and a gift certificate for dairy queen .
thank you ic .

he is ic twenty nine right now .
he sometimes comes ic home just to eat dinner , like during the weekends when he is adv not busy at work .

and there are ic these prophecies he has rel to follow .
and he has ic to solve a prophecy and somehow save the humans from the war .
and his father is being held captive ?
no , they saved ic his father is the first book .
but he is ic like sick under new york .
do you want to ask me any questions ?
now i would like to ask you about chess .
how long have you played chess ?
three years .
how old were you when you first started to play ?
i think ic around seven or nine , seven or eight .
seven or eight .

a chess coach at my elementary school .

since our chess coach from last year moved adv to vancouver , the parents from the chess club hired ic a grandmaster .
we have ic two .
one of them is ic carl .
and the other one is ic chuck .
i guess ic i do not know nom much about them , really .
do you like them ?
are they older ?
, they are ic old .
they are grandmasters ?
they are ic masters .
well , they are ic kind of close to being grandmasters .
but they are ic not exactly there .
are you learning a lot from them ?
do you belong to a chess club ?
, this school's chess club .
what is the name of the club ?
dragon knights .
how often do you play chess say in a typical week ?
including tournaments or just regular weeks .
just regular weeks .
i guess ic four games .
four games a week .
who do you play with the most ?
with friends or on the computer .
so you play on a computer ?
, there are ic some websites that help you look rel at the board clearer or just practice .
so you just start playing like you are playing .
, or they give ic you puzzles to solve .
can you adjust the level from easy to hard ?
can you name any famous chess player ?
karpov and i know ic them .
i just can not remember ic .
do you ever play chess on a computer ?
yes .
can you tell me a little more about that ?
just that you practice ic some puzzles .
and helps you analyze ic decisions better .
would you say that you are learning more from the computer or more from your chess teacher ?
well the computer just helps ic you analyze what position you are nom and look for any threats to you or if you are nom in danger or something .
but a coach shows ic you games and teaches you how to think and how to develop plans to win the game .
now tell me why you enjoy chess .
i guess ic i like nom to play games .
and chess always has ic you think about what you should do nom next .
so you like strategy .
i am not too familiar with the game of chess .
you probably know a lot more about it than i do .
so i would like you to explain some things to me .
first of all , how many people may play a game of chess at one time ?
a regular game of chess is ic two people .
i have heard of simultaneous matches .
do you know what that is ?
a simultaneous is ic when there is nom one person where they set up rel , for example , five boards and there are nom six people .
one person plays ic all five people .
he just keeps going ic around playing the other five people .
and he is ic either supposed to beat all five of them .
or one of the five players beats ic him .
but the person who walks rel around is ic usually the better player .
have you ever played center ?
have you ever done that in your chess club ?
no .
we have done ic it with the coach that teaches rel us .
we have done ic it before .
tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move .
the weakest piece in the game would be ic a pawn .
it is ic the eight pieces in the front .
they can only attack ic diagonally .
but like if a piece is adv right here , they can attack ic that way .
or if a piece or if it is adv near the other end and another pawn moves adv two spaces to go past it , it can move ic behind it and take it .
that is ic called en passant .
or if it reaches adv the end of the board it can be promoted ic to any piece on the game except a king or a pawn .
and the most important piece in the game would be ic the king because if it gets checked adv which means rel it is nom getting threatened by a piece , if it can not move adv anywhere else it means nom it is nom a mate .
but if it is adv the only piece that can move rel but it does not have adv any squares to go to , it is ic a draw .
and the other pieces are ic basically what you would use nom to attack and try to beat your opponent , like the bishop which can move rel in diagonals , any diagonals back and forth or the rooks which can move rel straight or sideways back and forth .
the knights move ic in an l shape .
and the queen which can move rel back and forth or diagonally is ic considered to be the most powerful piece .
so you have mentioned pawn , what is it called ?
en passant ?
, the en passant move .
it is ic when let us say nom you were nom on the opponent's side but the opponent has not moved nom like a pawn before .
if it is adv still at its original position , it can move ic forward two squares , but regularly one square .
but let us say ic there is nom a pawn there .
if a pawn moved adv one , a pawn could take ic it .
but if it moved adv twice , it technically could not take ic it .
but the en passant allows ic you to take it if you are adv right behind it .
and you just take ic it .
i have never heard of that .
that is a new one for me .
do you use that move very often ?
it is ic not very commonly used .
now tell me about the goals of chess .
in other words , what are the players trying to do ?
basically just checkmate them and just win the game .
but you have ic to learn what your opponent is nom doing .
try to get ic one of the five advantages which is rel force , time , space , material , or pawn structure .
and then you have ic to decide whether you want nom to play a middle game or an end game and play from there .
so the overall goal ?
it is ic to defeat your opponent .
now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
in other words , tell me everything you can think of about the game of chess so that someone who has never played before would know how to play .
you have you have you have ic sixty pieces on the board .
each of them can move ic differently .
the first piece you have rel are ic the first eight pieces in the front which are rel pawns that can move rel only one square but usually .
but in its beginning square it can move ic two squares .
it can only capture ic pieces that are rel diagonal from it .
and and the next piece and the next piece would be ic your rook which can move rel forward , sideways any , and back and forth .
and the knight can move ic in an l shape and jump over pieces .
the bishop which can move ic diagonally back and forth .
the queen , the queen that can move ic just like a bishop and a rook combined .
so it can move ic forward and back and back .
while a king can move ic only one square but one square in any direction .
and also and also if your king is adv in check and cannot move anywhere , or block the check , it is ic a checkmate and you lose nom .
and that is ic pretty much it .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
it is ic varied because if you are playing adv with people who have just started rel , it is nom maybe really quick .
but like in grand master games , their time control is ic two hours each for the game plus four hours .
so a really long time .
what is your longest game ?
i think ic an hour thirty .
did that feel like a really long game ?
yes .
what makes a game end quickly ?
if your opponent is not focusing ic enough or if they cannot analyze adv the position enough to see all your threats .
what makes a game last a long time ?
if you and your opponent are maybe equally have ic an equal ability in chess and you both have adv a long game and difficulty trying to checkmate each other .
that makes it last a long time ?
yes .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
yes .
can you describe how you use it ?
once you have set adv the time control to whatever you want nom for both player , you you it is ic time clock .
so white goes ic first because white always goes adv first .
and the player and then he makes ic his first move .
so then the button the time goes ic to the other player .
and they make ic their move .
they move ic .
press ic the clock and so on and so on .
how long do you usually program it for ?
it depends ic on the tournament , so a lot of different times .
what is the average time you program it for ?
probably forty five minutes .
forty five minutes .
do you feel like that is a rush or is it plenty of time ?
it is ic plenty of time .
is there any thing else you would like to tell me about chess ?
well there is ic other types of games like chess like .
there is ic one called blitz where you it you have nom a time control of five min both players .
so it is you can move ic pretty fast .
but if you make adv an illegal move , let us say nom , your king is nom in check and you do not see nom it and you move nom something else , they are ic allowed to take your king .
and then it is ic game over .
or say you make ic another illegal move .
say you move adv your pawn backwards that would also make you lose ic .
there is ic also another chess game called bug house which is rel basically like a team game .
you have ic four people play .
both are ic two players .
when you take adv a piece from your opponent , you give ic them to your partner .
and your partner can place ic that piece anywhere on the board .
except a pawn cannot be placed ic on the back row because it would be promoted adv .
but it can be ic placed on the row before it gets promoted adv .
and all the other rules are ic basically the same like chess like how all the pieces are moved nom .
and like blitz if you make adv an illegal move , your king loses ic .
so blitz and bug house .
there is ic also more .
so in bug house there are two players on a team and one player is just taking pieces ?
no , they are ic both doing the same thing .
except the main goal in that game is ic to communicate what pieces your partner needs nom or to stall so you can make nom your opponent move .
or you could also try ic , basically strategize with your partner to figure out a way to win .
so you both have your own board .
yes .
and you take your opponents pieces and give them to .
, and then whatever pieces you have rel with you , you can place ic them anywhere .
except the pawn cannot go ic on the promotion square .
so the pieces you take from your opponent go to your partner who has his own game going on and vice versa they give you their opponent's pieces .
so if this opponent gets your piece .
he will give ic his partner the piece he took rel from you .
and his partner is on this side of the table .
yes .
we are finished .

you it is ic a quiet time .
it is ic not all loud because everyone is avc concentrating on the game .
you like peace and quiet .
sometimes i like ic loudness .
and sometimes i like ic peace and quiet .
i am not to familiar with the game of the chess .
you probably know a lot more about it than i do .
i would like you to explain some things to me .
first of all how many people may play a game of chess at one time ?
a lot of people because there are ic different kinds of chess .
or are you talking ic about just the regular kind of chess ?
the regular kind of chess .
only two people could play ic at a time .
how about the not regular .
the not regular is ic a lot because every there are avc a couple of people on both teams .
they are ic all on a line .
and every time there is avc a turn , they move ic a piece .
how many people play in that ?
more than six ?
have you heard of simultaneous matches .
no .
me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move ?
there is ic a knight which moves rc in like an l shape or a seven shape .
and there is ic the pawn that can only move rc one but in their first move that can move rc two .
there is ic the rook which can only move rc forward or side to side or backwards .
and there is ic the queen which can basically do rc anything but the horse move .
and , and and then there is ic the king which you have rc to protect .
it moves ic one space every direction .
and there is ic the bishop that moves rc like that .
but they can move ic like that once .
and that is ic all the pieces .
now tell me about the goals of chess .
in other words what are the players trying to do ?
well there is ic different kind of goals .
is ic it just the main chess still ?
alright you have ic to try to checkmate the king with your pieces .
that is ic your main goal .
okay and if that happens , if you checkmate the other person , what happens .
then the game is ic over .
the game is over ?
wherever it got checkmated avc it loses ic .
now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
in other words tell me everything you can think about the game of chess so that never played before would know how to play .
well , i would like ic to show the rules on the board .
it would take ic a long long time discussing all of the rules .
basically every move you cannot do rc it with a piece is ic against the rules .
and like you only can attack ic , capture , one piece at a time unless there is avc special way that someone made up rc .
i just forgot ic all of the other rules .
so maybe if we pretend avc we have nom a board here you could explain ic it to me .
like if there was avc a couple pawns in like a line , you can not move ic them all at the same time .
you can only move ic one piece at a time .
once you move avc a piece and then take on your hand off , that is ic your move .
you can not ic take it back .
and there is ic like touch move and stuff .
i do not like ic touch move .
what is touch move .
if you touch avc a piece , then you have ic to move it .
you can't put your hand and think and then take it off ?
you can ic .
if you just like on accident touch avc it , then they they say ic you touched nom it so .
so is that all the rules basically ?
yes , the main rules .
now i would like you to tell me what the players should do in order to win the game .
in other words , what are some key strategies that every good player should know .
well my good strategy is ic make nom a wall with my pawns .
i set ic my good good pieces up and take like all my pawn , get it captured .
and then my pawns took ic out a whole bunch of other pieces .
so i checkmate ic the king with my other good pieces .
but i lose ic a couple of good pieces on the way .
but i don't ic .
i only castle ic with my king .
, there is ic another rule .
you can not castle ic with your rook and your king when your king is avc in check .
and you can not ic castle .
and then your castle is ic in danger from the piece .
you can not do ic that .
what is castle ?
it is ic a rook .
like say the king and the rook have , haven't hasn't ic moved .
and the pieces are ic out of the way .
one will the king will go ic here .
and then the rook will go ic here .
so basically , it helps ic protect them .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess .
well , between two like masters , it would take ic a couple of hours .
maybe just an hour .
a normal game would be ic not very long .
fifteen minutes maybe .
, maybe .
well normally , like five .
what make a game last a long time ?
people like like do not make ic a move .
they keep on thinking ic about moves .
i always see ic a better move .
sometimes that .
what makes a game end quickly ?
everyone likes ic moving really fast .
once i am done avc with our tournament , i just move ic the piece .
what is your style ?
i like doing it ic kind of medium fast .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
, i was avc never taught so i kind of know ic but not really .
can you tell me what a typical day is like in your chess club ?
when you went to the chess club .
like what did you do in your chess club .
what does ic typical mean ?
like the usual .
you show up , your coach tells you a new strategy .
i just sitdown ic and play someone .
they did not teach you a strategy every week .
no they do not ic .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess .
nothing else .
do you have any brothers or sisters ?
yes , actually i got ic six sisters , four brothers .
whoo , that's a big family .

i just got one .
and another chihuahua , slightly bigger than the pomeranian named bruiser .
burzer ?
bruiser .
bruiser .
he kept trying ic to get into fights with the golden retriever lab mix that we call rel feeby .
so , , that is ic why we started nom calling him bruiser .
, and then feeby is ic the big golden retriever , white lab mix .
so , , pretty big family .
my , i guess .
well , it's kind of nice though , isn't it ?
so , do you have a favorite tv show or movie ?

the thing was ic you said nom you thought nom you had nom a big family .

no .
okay .
i do not watch ic many of those talk shows like that , no .
well , i thought that maybe miss miksch , or however she says her name .
mix .
maybe would mention something .
no , the only people i know rel of are ic her and the coach at the high school .
okay .
so , do you ever play chess on a computer ?
yes i do ic actually .
i have ic it up on my quick entering bar on the top of my screen .
can you tell me about it ?
it is ic just normal everyday computer chess .
most of the time , the computer wins ic .
ha .
i think i've seen someone play it , but i'm not real sure .
, it is ic kind of weird , a little different than playing with someone who is sitting rel there talking to you , trying to make you get all intimidated you know .
yep .
you don't feel intimidated by the .
you are trying ic to get them to be scared , trying make them make bad moves and whatnot pretty much .
so , a real person ?
it is ic not like a real person .
so , there is ic someone moving the things around .
it is ic like playing a game with yourself .
, so now can you tell me why you enjoy chess ?
hmm , i do not really know ic .
i just think ic it is nom kind of fun .
it tests ic your mind and yep , your strate your strategy .
and it also helps ic with .
this is ic one thing i thought rel about .
for some reason , life ends ic up a lot like chess , in battlefields and whatnot .
if you think adv about it , it really is ic like that .
good thinking .
you gotta get ic like i think it's sixteen , i don't remember , so sixteen man teams you know going out in the field .
and then you just can run ic em up like those people , use em like that .
move ic these people forward .
move ic them over there .
it is ic the same thing .
same basic battle strategies .
and that's part of why you enjoy it , you think or ?
that is ic kind of why i enjoy nom it .
it is ic just something that teaches rel you to think of complex strategies to do things .
speaking of complex strategies , , we're going to talk about the rules of chess now .
so , i'm not too familiar with the game of chess .
i told you that i play a little bit , but not that familiar with it and you probably know a lot more about it than i do .
so , i'd like you to explain some things to me .
first of all , how many people can play a game of chess at one time ?
two , unless you go ic into one of the funny types of matches .
you got ic four way chess .
you got ic bughouse .
you got ic crisscross .
many different ways .
crisscross , you gotta turn ic the board to where the corners are facing nom the players .
and you line ic the people up on the corner instead of the side .
i've never heard of that .
it is ic many different ways to play .
that is ic what we do nom here anyway .
so , i've heard of simultaneous matches .
do you know what that is ?
simultaneous .
is not ic that in a row or something ?
probably something that has ic to do with tournament stuff or like that .
, we do not do ic much of that around here because no one shows up adv every day really .
i show up ic as much as i can adv , but still can't make it every day .
like i missed ic the last one which was rel .
tuesday .
, i missed ic tuesday cuz i had adv to get out of here quick .
so , can you tell me about different pieces and how they're supposed to move ?
well , we got ic the basic pawns who .
and how do they move ?
they just when they first start adv , they can move ic either one or two forward .
and then , what happens if it's diagonal ?
and then you can just move ic diagonally and take over that area .
okay , so pawn .
what else is in there ?
we also got ic the rook , which a lot of people call rel the castle , and the horse , as people call it rel .
but it is ic really called the knight .
and the bishop , the pointy head guy .
and what do those guys do ?
the bishops both move ic as far as they want adv in a diagonal line .
but once they hit adv someone , they gotta stop ic .
they can not turn ic corners in one move .
what happens if they hit someone ?
then they take over ic that space .
okay .
same as everything if you hit ic someone .
okay , right .
and rooks , they can move ic the same way , only only straight on the lines .
they can not go ic back .
and the knights , they move ic like a weird l shape .
so , it is ic hard to tell anybody how you can move nom those things but unless you show adv them or something .
right , an l shape .
is that so they can go .
can they go two forward and one over or do they .
one they can do ic either way , one forward , two over , two forward , one over .
it works ic either way .
they are ic probably the most mobile person on there .
they can move ic to the entire area around them .
so , , they are ic a pretty good person to have .
and also , my personal favorite is ic well , not really my personal favorite .
it is ic kind of tied with the castle , the rooks you know .
people get ic after me for that all the time .
i call ic em castles because it is adv easier he's whispering this .
and why do you call them castles ?
because they are ic castles .
okay .
they look like ic a little castle .
people call ic em rooks , no way !
they can do ic any person's move but the knight's .
they can't do ic knights .
so , , they are ic probably the best defending person and attacking person .
and then there is ic the king who can move rel one space in any direction at all .
so , , those are ic the pieces right there .
okay , so let's see .
now , tell me about the goals of chess .
in other words , what are the players trying to do ?
well , it really depends ic on the type of game of chess you are playing rel .
like i said adv , there is ic many types i would not play rel .
so how about with a basic game .
basic game .
you want ic to make it to where a person is able nom to hit their king and if no matter where their king tries nom to avoid that attack .
th well when you got adv a person who is able rel to hit the king in the next move , then that is ic called check , right ?
so but you want you want ic is where even if it is sitting adv there , it is being nom able to be attacked , if it moves adv anywhere else in its range , that it will be attacked nom there too .
so , , that is ic what you want nom .
that is ic checkmate .
the goal is get that king and trap him .
checkmate .
checkmate , .
sometimes you can get ic em with just a king and two pawns .
and sometimes it takes ic both your rooks , both your knights , and a bishop .
so , , it really depends ic on where they are nom on the board .
if they are adv in the center , it is ic going to take a few more pieces .
but , if they are adv right back in the corner , it is ic real easy .
so , now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
in other words , tell me everything you can think of about the game of chess so that someone who has never played before would know how to play .
well , really all you gotta do ic is follow the movements of the pieces , get the checkmate and .
there is ic one other that i did not really get rel for the longest time .
castling .
i've heard of that .
so , what is that ?
what you do nom is ic , if your king and the castle on either side , is the funny thing .
there is ic a queen side castle and king side castle .
king side castle is ic the one i the one that i did not know rel for the longest time .
and then about two weeks later , i learned ic about the queen side castle when one of my friends tried adv to use it on me .
so , .
so he told you what it was ?
when he was doing it ?
he told ic me what it was nom because i thought adv , “wait , what is that” nom .
and , so a king side castle , if both of these people are gone adv , then you can move ic your king over two spaces and castle over two spaces , switching them around to where your castle is guarding nom your king .
and on the queen side castle , you move ic your king over two spaces the same .
but you gotta have ic all three of them , the queen , the bishop , and the knight moved out of the way so that you can get adv the king over three spaces into the queen's position .
i do not know ic .
see , i am still trying ic to figure out the queen side castle myself sometimes .
so .
it is ic kind of weird .
okay , so let's see , now i'd like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess .
in other words , what are some key strategies that every good player should know ?
well , there is ic one that really is rel just annoying .
you gotta know ic how to defend it .
that is ic the only thing you need rel to know about it .
you need ic to know how to defend it .
it is ic called the three move checkmate .
three moves ?
so , you can do a checkmate in three moves ?
i can not do ic it yet .
but i know ic like four people who can rel .
it is ic really annoying .
i know ic how to block it .
but i can ic not do it .
so , you couldn't explain how somebody else who can do it does it ?
, i mean the way i block rel is ic i just play nom my normal strategy by doing my normal formation and all .
but , as they are setting adv up , i can not see ic what they are doing nom until like four moves into the game .
but , i somehow manage ic to block it with my set up .
so , what do you mean by as they're setting up ?
see it takes ic a few moves to set up for this attack .
so , you are ic able to get a few people out there so that you can take adv .
see , what you want to do nom is ic you get nom the pawns in front of you out .
and that is ic probably how you do it nom .
that way you have ic a chance in order to hit them if they try adv and come in at you .
cuz the thing is ic the queen is nom the one who actually puts rel the king in checkmate in checkmate .
this is not a typo , he did say “in checkmate” two times .
there is ic nothing they can do rel to block it .
they move ic their queen and the bishop both out in within two turns .
and it is ic checkmate .
so , .
it sounds tough .
it is ic a really hard one too .
so only i used ic to know how to do it .
and now i have forgotten ic it .
so , you'll get it back probably , ?
so , how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
anywhere from thirty seconds to an hour .
, if they are trying adv to stall by doing all this other stuff , then , it could go ic for awhile .
how long do you usually play ?
most of the time , ten to thirty minutes .
i was wanting ic to play this one kid .
we were playing ic the entire time .
he kept trying ic to stall and somehow made it to the end of the class to where we would have nom to come back to the game the next week .
so , how does that work ?
you write ic down the positions of all your people and everything so you can adv come back , reset up the game and continue from where you were nom .
so , .
it sounds like fun .
so , what makes a game last a long time ?
hmm .
when you get down ic to where they kill nom your best people , to where you are nom down to pawns and whatnot , pawns , knight , maybe a bishop .
those are ic the last few people .
and then it takes ic a long time to try and get everything to a checkmate , because they got adv all their pawns and whatnot over in their side blocking it .
like , this one time , he had ic three spaces , three pawns right here , his king sitting right there , and a castle right there .
the only way to beat him would be ic to take out his third take out the middle pawn without him taking you out because , no matter what , he is adv going to get you .
well , really what you want to do nom is ic get a knight in there to be able to take him out .
the problem is ic the pawns .
what you want to but if that is adv the case , you want to take ic out the third pawn and the castle .
it is ic kinda weird .
really hard to think about .
especially without a board in front of you .
so , what makes a game end quickly be short ?
well , like i said adv before , there is ic moves that people can do rel really fast .
and somehow , someone actually said ic they got nom a two move checkmate .
do you think that's true ?
well , it probably is ic because .
here is ic the thing .
if you move adv one pawn out , your queen can come ic out and just be able to hit them if they move adv their pawn out .
and then it is ic checkmate .
so , .
so , do you know how to use a chess clock ?
chess clock .
no , but i have seen ic those on tv shows before .
i never really understood ic the point of it .
but i remember ic on my computer chess game , that there is nom this clock that times rel how long it takes nom each person .
we have ic like five minutes at the start .
and each time you make rel a move , the clock stops ic .
and then their clock starts ic going .
and when their clock starts adv , yours starts ic going down .
so , you have ic a limited amount of five minutes each .
so you have to make your move within that time ?
and what happens if you don't ?
well i do not know ic .
on the computer ?
actually ten minutes , because you both got ic five minutes to make all your moves so .
it seems pretty fast .
so is there anything else that you want to tell me about chess ?
i guess ic i already pretty summed nom it up pretty much i guess , unless there is adv any other questions but .
, let's see .
there's no other questions right there but i was just trying to think if i had any more questions .
i guess a question would be , my husband and i play chess and can you give me some strategies that maybe he won't know about that i could just get in there and i mean probably not the three move strategy .
i know , cuz .
the thing is ic , you want nom to corner their king .
that is ic the easiest way to go .
corner their king ?
so , try and make em .
move that way .
and how do you make them do that ?
by putting them in check to make him move that way instead of coming this way by making it so that he can't move anywhere this way .
by putting two people here , you can block ic both of those spaces over here so that he can not go adv that way .
he would have ic to go that way .
that is ic what you want nom to do .
the easiest way to do that is ic just to take two castles , line them up on the ends with one here , like that .
he moves ic over here .
you move ic the next one until he moves adv behind someone .
then , you are going to have ic to start moving your other people .
and what if he catches on that i'm trying to move him to the corner ?
then he will try ic and take out your castles cuz there is adv no other way to get at get through there .
so you want to ic get in quick .
okay .
it is ic a very good strategy though .
it sounds like it .
you want to ic have them right on the row of the pawns .
do you have any brothers or sisters ?
yes , i have ic a brother and a sister .
what are their names ?
noah and nissa .
noah and nissa ?
and how old are they ?
noah is ic seven .
and nissa is ic five .
can you tell me anything else about them ?
well like what do you .
like what you like to do with them ?
and sometimes me , noah and nissa will play ic a game together .
do you have any pets at home .
we have ic a dog named tani .
can you tell me more about your pet ?
well she is ic a labrador retriever .
she is ic one and a half years old .
she is ic pretty hyper but only when like people come avc to the door .
she likes ic to jump on tall men but she doesn't but only if like she is avc really excited and it is someone she knows avc that she really likes rc .
but otherwise she will not really jump ic .
and she really likes she loves ic to eat .
how often do you feed her ?
we feed ic her twice a day .
do you have a favorite tv show or movie ?
i really like ic the movie parent trap .
but i do not really have ic a favorite movie or tv show .
you said you liked parent trap .
could you tell me about that .
well it is ic about two girls .
and well they do not know ic each other .
but they both happen ic to go to the same camp .
and they really hate ic each other because they are avc good at the same things .
like they sort of get ic into all of these fights .
and they get ic into trouble .
and they are ic put in a little house together and instead of their usual cabin .
and then they find ic out that they are really twins nom .
and then they try to get and their parents had been divorced ic .
and they try ic to get their parents back together so they can live avc together and their family can be avc back together .
how did they find out they were twins ?
they found out ic because one parent one of them said avc i wish nom i had nom a dad .
i only live ic with my mom .
my dad got divorced ic when i was avc little .
and the other one said ic i only have nom a dad .
i wish ic i had nom a mom .
my mom and dad got ic divorced when i was avc little too .
and then and then one of them , the one that lives with the mom rc had ic a picture of the dad .
and the one with the dad had ic a picture of the mom .
and the picture was ic ripped right in half .
and they both had ic half of a picture .
and they put ic them together .
and they saw ic that it went nom together .
so that is ic how they found out nom that they were nom twins .
that sounds like a fun movie .
do you like to read books or magazines ?
, i really like ic to read good books .
, i really like ic to read a lot .
can you tell me about a book you have read recently .
well i am reading ic a book called a little princess .
it is ic really good .
it is ic about this girl .
she is ic rich .
and but she does not like ic .
she is ic really kind .
and she tells ic stories .
and she is ic really friendly to everyone even the littler kids .
she is ic a wonderful wonderful story teller .
and she makes ic friends with the maid .
and she is ic never rude to anyone unless they have done avc something really mean .
but she does not really say ic anything .
she is ic really nice .
but then her father .
but then one day , and the it is ic a boarding school she is nom at .
her father her father is ic a prince .
and he he sent ic her to boarding school .
and he buys ic her everything she wants rc .
and and then and and at the school there is ic someone who runs rc the school .
and she is ic really mean .
and she is ic rude .
but she is ic nice .
the girl's name is ic sarah .
and she is ic really nice to sarah because sarah is avc rich and has a lot of money .
then one day on her eleventh birthday , sarah finds ic out that her father has died nom penniless in india .
and her family is ic from india .
she does not have ic a mom .
her mom died ic before she was avc born .
her father died ic penniless in india .
and since she had avc no more money and she did not have avc any more money anymore the person who ran rc the school made ic her sleep upstairs with the maid in the attic where there were nom rats running around .
that sounds like an interesting book .
how do you think it is going to end .
i do not know ic .
i am ic not sure how it will end nom .
i have ic no idea .
do you want to ask me anything .
no .
how long have you played chess ?
for about well like i haven't learned , i've just about like three and a half month ago .
and how old were you when you first started to play ?
when i first started avc to play i was ic nine .
and who taught you how to play chess .
my dad .
do you have a chess rating .
what do you mean ic ?
if you play in tournaments you get a chess rating .
no , i have not played ic in any tournaments .
i just play ic for fun at home .
do you have a chess coach or a teacher ?
no .
do you belong to a chess club .
no .
how often do you play chess in a typical week ?
i'm ic really busy so probably once or twice a week .
who do you play with the most ?
my brother .
can you name any famous chess players .
no .
do you ever play chess on the computer ?
yes , i have played ic before .
not usually on the computer .
the chess thing we have rc is ic sort of like a computer with the sound on .
it is ic this guy .
you can play ic against him .
it is ic sort of an automatic computer .
then you can choose ic your levels and everything .
so and then we also have ic a regular board that does not have rc that .
and you can play ic with the sound off too .
and the board is a computer ?
do you like using that board or the computer .
i like it ic because , i like it because it tells avc if we did nom something , if you make nom a mistake , and if it is nom something that is illegal rc to do .
but i like ic the other board better because you can just sort of do avc like your own game because there is avc some really like , there's sound effects on it that i don't really that i do not really like rc .
like if you are avc thinking of a move it will say ic hello are nom you still there ?
so i like ic both of them .
there is no way to turn that off ?
well you can play ic it with the whole computer off .
so you can do ic that with the whole computer off and no sound effects .
but if you want the computer , you have to have the sound effects .
tell me why you enjoy chess ?
i like ic it because it is avc cool how the different pieces move nom and how you can set up nom positions so you can attack avc other pieces .
it is ic like a battle between one side and another side .
how many people can play a game a of chess .
two unless you are ic on a team with someone .
but like there would have to be ic two teams of people .
i've heard of simultaneous matches .
have you heard of that ?
no .
can you please tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move ?
well , the rook , it is ic at the end of the board .
and it can move ic forward as many spaces as it wants avc or sideways however many spaces it wants avc .
it can do ic and it can any way it wants rc .
so it can move ic so .
and it can ic attack .
and it attacks ic just like that going to piece .
and then knight , the knight goes ic one , two over .
or it can go ic one , two over .
and so it can go ic any direction one , two over .
and if it avc lands on another piece , then you get ic the piece .
then there is ic the bishop , which can go rc diagonal as far as it wants avc any direction , diagonal any direction as far as it wants avc .
and it can attack ic that way too .
and the queen can go ic as many spaces as it wants avc , as many directions as it wants avc .
and as many directions as it wants .
so that the that is ic the best piece that can move rc because it can move avc the most ways .
then the king is ic sort of the most , he's kind of the most important .
but the queens move ic the most .
and she can get ic people the best .
but the king , you want ic to keep him because if because the point of the game is avc to get the other person's king .
and if you get avc the other person's king , you win ic the game no matter how many pieces you got rc .
so that is ic the point of the game .
and the king can only move ic one space at a time in any direction but only one space at a time .
then it goes ic back down again the same ones .
then there is ic pawns .
on the opening move , when they are avc in their starting place , they can move ic two space out .
but normally they just move ic one space at a time .
they cannot move ic sideways .
they can only move ic forward .
and to attack someone they have to do ic it diagonally .
they can do ic it diagonally , but only to attack someone .
and then those are ic the pieces .
thank you .
now tell me about the goals of chess .
in other words , what are players trying to do ?
get other the other team's pieces .
the other teams good pieces .
but the main part of the game is ic to get the other team's king because that is avc how you win avc the game .
you get the king can move ic places .
so if you trap the king if you trap if you get avc the king in a position like here is , so if there is the king and then there is nom a rook , the one that can move rc sideways and forwards in front of it , it can go ic straight and get it .
but if it is avc the king's turn , he can move ic one space over .
so he is ic not .
and if someone can get avc the king it is ic called check .
but then if the king can move somewhere else to escape that check .
but if the king is trapped avc and anywhere he goes rc something will get avc him , that is called ic checkmate .
and the game is ic over .
so those are ic the pieces .
and that is ic the goal .
now tell me the rules that player need to follow .
in other words tell me everything you can thing about the game of chess so that someone who has never play before would know how to play .
well should i tell ic you about the pieces again or because i already told avc .
should i tell ic about the pieces again ?
the rules .
well pawns go ic two spaces on their opening move .
but they cannot go ic to the sides .
then and knights knights most most pieces if it wants avc to get , if one piece is avc on one side of the board and another piece is avc on the other , like the rook , who could move rc as many spaces as it wants avc forward but there is nom pawns in the path , it can not just go ic through and get all the pawns in its path .
it has ic to get one at a time .
it is ic like the pawns are nom barrier for it .
so when it gets avc a pawn it can move ic on to the next pawn , next turn .
and but knights knights are ic different .
they can hop ic over pieces though .
and the queen most some people like ic to use it a lot .
you can decide ic what you want nom to do .
if you can use avc , it is ic good to use your queen a lot .
but some people do not like ic to because it is avc too risky .
but then you can get ic a lot of players if you use avc it .
and there is ic no point in having it and just letting it sit there .
and it is ic also really good against the other team's queen .
so then it has ic nothing because it has avc no queen to defend the king .
it is ic good .
it does ic not really matter that much , pawn .
if you get avc a pawn it is ic really good .
it is ic really good if you get avc one of the more important pieces the knights , the rooks , the bishops , and the king and the queen .
they are ic all in the back row .
and the pawns go ic in to front row .
so it is ic better to do that .
and if something got avc your king in check , there is ic lots of things you can do rc .
if it is avc possible , you can move ic your king so it can not get avc into check .
but if you can not do avc that , if there is avc a piece like your queen next to it that is rc still in there , you can go ic diagonally and block it .
or you can go ic with a knight .
and you can block your you can block ic your king .
and you can and you can block and you can block ic your king if you can not move avc anywhere with it .
and then and then sort of like if it is avc right in front , it can be ic in front of the king .
then it can be ic right in front .
in front of the king and it can be ic anywhere in front of the king that the player can not get rc it .
and you are ic not allowed to do a move that puts rc your king in check .
that is ic illegal .
that is ic against the rules in chess .
so you can not ic do that .
a bit like losing on purpose .
, sort of .
you can not do ic a move .
and some move you do not know ic that .
you do not know ic that .
but if something can get avc your king in check , than you can not ic do any move to get your own move in check .
and when someone is in check when someone when you put avc the other person in check , you have to say ic check .
or else it is ic not fair because you have to say avc check .
you are ic warning them .
that is ic all you need nom to know .
now i would like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess .
in other word what are some key strategies that every good player should know ?
well you should try ic before you just go like just move avc some pieces like not looking .
you should try ic to think of some plan or strategy to get to get some piece surrounded in any way it moves rc to get it surrounded and get all the pieces trapped so you can get all of them avc .
and when you are avc getting other pieces you have to get try not , you have to look ic around and think two or three and think like two , three , four moves ahead to see .
you have to think ic a few moves ahead to see what should happen nom if i moved avc here .
well they could get ic me .
but i could do ic that .
so you have to set ic up this whole area .
you have to set up ic sort of a trap for the other team .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
well there is ic really a lot of different times .
if it is avc someone like your own level that is rc your own level , then it takes about it is ic a pretty long game .
an hour , half hour , forty five minutes like around forty five min close to there , close to that .
what makes a game last a long time ?
if each team puts avc their self into these positions , like in traps where none of their players can get nom caught , it is ic usually if they're avc really good players because and then they can put .
and then all these positions where their players can not be nom caught and then it takes ic just so long .
and it takes ic so long to do .
and i remembered ic another rule for chess .
if you get avc a pawn to the other side , you can get rid ic of that pawn and get any other piece you want rc on the board .
but you cannot have ic two kings because that would not be avc fair .
you can have ic two queens .
you can have ic two knights .
or you can have ic two knights already .
but you can get ic a third .
you can get ic any piece you want rc any piece you want except for the king when you get avc a pawn to the other side of the board .
does that happen very often .
well not usually because it , because it is ic a big jumble at first because there are avc all these pieces on the board and there is avc no room to get by any where .
like it is ic crowded you know .
but then it is ic just hard to get it across without .
there are ic so many other good pieces still to .
so it usually does not happen ic that often .
it does not usually happen ic that often .
what makes the game end quickly .
well if you are not playing ic with someone your own level that .
but also if one person if one team traps ic the other person so they can do like they can not really do avc anything but just do some simple moves .
and then they get , and they just find ic a way and surround all the pieces so no one can block avc it and get the pieces set up the trap to get the king .
they kind of like make ic all the pieces so they can not move avc all that much and they can not protect avc .
if one team sets up avc a trap for sort of for the other team that get rc their king in checkmate or there is then the game will just end ic quickly .
do you know how to use a chess clock .
no .
anything else you want to tell me about chess .
no .
well thank you for letting me talk to you about chess today .
you have been very helpful .
so before we talk avc about chess , i would ic like to know something about you .
i'm going ic to ask you a few general questions .
and then you can ask ic me some questions too if you want .
okay ?
so do you have ic any brothers and sisters ?
yes i have ic one sister .
and what is ic her name ?
kelly .
and how old is ic she ?
she is ic thirteen .
do you have ic any pets ?
yes i have ic a cat .
what is ic your cat's name ?
boots .
i knew ic that .
do you have ic any favorite tv shows or movies ?
my favorite tv show is ic probably the simpsons .
and my favorite movie hmm .
do you have ic a favorite movie ?
well there is ic a movie i think i will like called bridge to terabithia .
and then a movie i like .
i do not know .
do you have ic any favorite books then ?
the harry potter series .
now do you want ic to ask me any questions ?
sure what is ic your favorite tv show and movie ?
favorite tv show is ic grey's anatomy .
and my favorite movie hmm .
i actually just saw ic a movie last night called stranger than fiction .
and i really liked ic that movie .
okay so now i am going ic to ask you about chess .
okay .
you ready ?
so how long have you played ic chess for ?
since i was ic probably eight seven so three years .
how old were ic you when you first started nom to play chess ?
so who taught ic you how to play chess ?
my dad .
now do you know ic what a chess rating is ?
no .
then you do not have ic one then ?
no .
so do you have ic a chess coach to teach you then or just your dad ?
no .
do you belong ic to a chess club ?
no .
how often do you play ic during the week or the weekend ?
i do not play ic very much but sometimes i mean pretty much once a week on the weekends .
who do you play ic with the most ?
my dad .
do you know ic any famous chess players ?
no .
do you ever play ic chess on the computer ?
hmm sometimes i play ic chess on my gameboy would that count ?
that would ic count .
now tell ic me why you enjoy chess ?
hmm i just kind of like ic the strategies .
and how you have ic to figure it out .
and picture ic it before you play .
i'm not really familiar ic with the game of chess .
and you probably know ic a lot more than i do .
so i want ic you to explain some things to me so i understand avc a little bit better .
okay .
so first of all avc how many people can play ic a game of chess at one time ?
two .
and i have heard ic of simultaneous matches .
do you know nom what this is , and can you explain ic this to me if you do ?
no i don't know ic what that is nom .
tell ic me about the different pieces , and how they are supposed to move rc ?
well there is ic a row of how many ?
there is i think eight pieces there is ic sixteen pieces .
there is ic eight pawns in the front .
and then there is ic a rook or a castle a a knight not a bishop a knight a .
then it is ic king , queen .
and then it goes ic bishop , knight , rook again .
and then the pawns can move ic forward one .
except on their very first move they can move ic over two .
and then the only way that pawns can hit rc an opponent is ic to go diagonal and not go forward .
a rook can move ic forward and forward and sideways as many spaces until it hits avc something .
and a knight can move ic in an l shape so it can go avc three up and then one over in any direction .
a bishop can move ic diagonally for however many spaces in which ever way .
a king can move ic one space in any direction .
a queen can move ic in the same as a king .
except it can move ic as many spaces as it wants .
and that is ic it .
so tell ic me about the goals of chess ?
so in other words what are the players trying ic to do ?
players are trying ic to get the king into checkmate .
and checkmate is ic when the king is the king is nom here .
and then there are ic pieces surrounding it and it can't it is it is .
and it can't it is it is it has ic to move so it would not get avc hit for the next turn .
but when it moves avc in any direction it still gets it is still going to to get hit ic .
and that is ic checkmate .
and they win ic .
so now tell ic me the rules that players need rc to follow .
so in other words tell ic me everything you can think rc of about the game of chess so that someone who has never played nom before , like myself , would know how to play .
well pretty much what i said ic before about all the pieces and how they move nom .
and then you would have to say ic that probably you cannot hmm you cannot jump nom over pieces so you cannot except for the knight .
it can ic when it does avc like the other time that it can jump rc over pieces .
but like a bishop , a king , a queen , or anything they cannot jump ic over pieces .
and you cannot have ic two pieces on the same same square .
so you could not have ic like a pawn right here and a pawn right behind it and then move the pawn up and .
now i would like you to tell ic me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess .
in other words what are ic some key strategies that every good player should know ?
okay well one of my favorites is ic where you can beat nom the opponent in four moves .
okay .
so you move ic your pawn that is rc in front of your king up .
no no it is the pawn in front of your it is ic the pawn in front of your king up .
and then next turn you take ic your bishop and put it about i think two two squares so that before it would hit avc the edge and then your queen all the way over to the edge .
and then take ic your queen and go diagonal .
go diagonal and it would it would take ic the pawn .
and then your king would try ic and get your queen .
but your bishop would be ic there .
and it would it would take ic your king .
so then so then you would be ic in checkmate .
so how long does ic it usually take to play a game of chess ?
average game would probably be ic about ten minutes .
and what makes a game last a really long time ?
there is when it kind of gets avc down to just a couple pieces , it is ic really hard to take them unless somebody gets does avc a mistake .
they make ic a mistake so like so the other person can take avc their piece .
and it is ic harder to get your opponents king in checkmate because you only have avc so many pieces to play .
and then what makes ic a game end really quickly ?
somebody doing ic the move that i did rc and not stopping it .
and do you know ic how to use a chess clock ?
okay can you tell ic me about it ?
there is ic a certain time .
and you make ic your move .
and then once you are done avc you then you hit ic it .
and it goes ic off on the other side .
and it starts ic the timer on your opponents side .
and when they are avc done you hit ic it .
and then it is ic either once you get avc into somebody's checkmate that you win nom or once the person's timer runs avc out then they lose nom .
and is there anything else you want to tell ic me about chess ?
no .
so thanks again for talking ic to me today .
and it has ic been really helpful .
i'm so glad you wanted ic to participate .
and i have ic a gift certificate for you and if you want this pen ?
but i'm guessing ic you support the other side .
thanks again that was ic it .
okay .
do you have any brothers or sisters ?
i have ic a little sister .
and what is her name ?
audrey .
how old is she ?
four .
what else can you tell me about her ?
she invades ic my space a lot and is about half my size .
do you have any pets at home ?
no .
they both died ic .
i have two cats .
what kind of pets did you have before ?
a fish and a cat .
they both died ?
do you have a favorite tv show or movie ?
no .
a lot are ic good so .
what's good ?
a lot of them are ic good .
so you have just a lot of favorites .
can you pick out one that you really like or one you have seen recently ?
no .
do you like to read books or magazines ?
well some picture books i read ic a few chapter books .
i have ic to know a lot about them before i really start avc them .
so what chapter book did you read recently ?
a book called warriors .
it is ic this big series .
i have not heard of that book .
no .
most of them have ic three hundred pages in them , at least .
have you read the whole series ?
no , they have ic something called the new prophecy .
i am ic on that , the first book .
there were ic six in the first part of it .
and now i am ic starting the prophecy .
you are starting the prophecy now ?
a new one .
and then they are ic going to have another one come out .
so , are you a harry potter fan ?
no .
no .
now , do you want to ask me anything ?
no .
how long have you played chess ?
i do ic not know .
my dad just said ic let us play nom this fun game .
so then he went ic to the bathroom or something .
i could not even set ic the pieces .
i just set ic them down in a crazy order .
so i do ic not know .
i just remember ic that from starting .
so you started when you were really young ?
do you remember how old you were when you first started to play ?
i want ic to say about fiveish , five , six .
that is ic just what i remember nom learning my first games .
who taught you how to play chess ?
my dad .
he is ic good at it .
i can not beat ic him that often .
do you have a chess rating ?
i do ic not know .
jerry , my chess coach at school , we have ic chess ladder .
and i am ic around maybe tenth right now out of a few kids , not very many .
i guess ic there is nom about twenty kids .
we have ic two separate groups .
we have ic the lower group and the higher group .
do you have a chess coach or teacher ?
yes , jerry .
can you tell me about jerry .
it is ic like , yes they are made nom of solid gold instead of plastic .
so the trophies they are plastic .
they are kind of plasticy painted ic gold so they look avc real kind of .
you can tell ic it is nom fake .
but they still look nice .
do you belong to a chess club ?
yes .
kind of already mentioned ic all that .
how often do you play chess in a typical week ?
in a week ?
that reminds ic me .
sometimes , we play ic a lot if we are preparing avc for a tournament .
we play ic two games the night before depending on how late it was nom .
but we do not play ic much anymore .
i still like ic to get a tournament when i can avc .
so , what is ic a tournament like ?
a lot of people play ic .
and jerry kind of takes ic us .
there is ic a lot of schools who come rc .
and he will , there there is ic different kinds of tournaments .
there is ic special .
there is ic different team ones .
there is ic regional .
there is ic one team where you get rc four people on your team .
and there is ic a captain .
and the captain will play ic the captain .
the second best will play ic the second best .
and the match up will be ic like that .
this is getting ic confusing .
your chess club , your team , and you just play ic games .
you are kind ic of individual rather than the other team .
it feels ic kind of funny .
was your chess tournament here in eugene ?
, most of them are ic at the veterans' building .
some are ic at high school .
well , that is ic mostly the regional .
most of them are ic at the veterans' building in eugene by little caesar's .
okay , that sound like a lot of fun .
did i ask you how often you play in a typical week ?
yes , you asked ic me that .
who do you play with the most ?
my dad .
can you name any famous chess players ?
no .
do you ever play chess on a computer ?
yes , i have a ic little mac in my room .
my mom inserted ic mac chess .
the computer usually beats ic me .
i do not know ic why .
it does not seem ic like it is nom that much better than my dad .
but you like that ?
you like the practice ?
, i like ic playing my dad , a real person , more than a computer because a computer does not think avc .
now tell me why you enjoy chess .
i do not know ic if i enjoy enjoy nom it .
it is ic fun .
but i do not think ic it is nom one of my favorite things to do .
why do ic i enjoy nom chess ?
good question .
you think ic about it .
it is ic fun to capture the other guy's pieces and win .
but i do ic not really know .
i just do ic it for fun kind of is nom the real big reason why .
okay , there are no right or wrong answers .
i think ic i sound nom weird on the recorder .
i am not too familiar with the game of chess .
you probably know a lot more about it than i do .
otherwise it would be ic dumb for you to ask me these questions .
so i'd like you to explain some things to me .
how many people can play a game of chess at one time ?
two can play ic .
there is ic some where you can get nom a right or wrong answer .
i have heard of simultaneous matches .
do you know what that is ?
no , i have not heard ic .
tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move .
the pawn on your first turn can move ic two squares forward .
it cannot move ic diagonally or vertically .
it just well it goes ic vertically .
it just goes ic in one straight line .
it can not go ic backward .
it takes ic diagonally one square ahead of it .
it cannot go ic further than that .
the knight has ic a little special move .
it can jump ic over pieces .
it moves ic in an shape .
no other piece does ic that .
so knight is ic very unique .
three down i guess ic or three in any direction that is rc not diagonal and one across from either square .
it cannot be ic forward or backward .
it has ic to be left or right three squares , either left or right in any direction that is rc not diagonal .
that is ic the knight .
it can jump ic people .
i never said ic that .
rooks .
well there is ic a rook .
kind of just name the pieces .
okay .
it just goes ic in ranks and files , left and right , forward and backward , no diagonal .
the bishop is ic just diagonal .
a special thing about the bishop is ic it starts nom out on , it is nom a checker board , black and white squares .
now you have ic a black bishop and a white bishop , both the same color .
but they are ic on a different square .
so that bishop should stay ic on that color square the whole time .
that is ic why when a friend had avc both bishops end up on a white square .
so she decided ic , you win nom .
do not do ic that .
the queen is ic kind of like a bishop and a rook combined into one piece .
and the king is ic basically the same thing .
only only it can only move ic one square .
it can not go ic more than two in one turn .
and they can go ic on black and white squares .
that is ic all the pieces .
now tell me the goals of chess .
in other words , what are the players trying to do ?
players are ic trying to .
there is ic this thing called check .
pieces take ic and capture pieces in this sort of way .
like i said ic , the pawn can capture nom diagonally .
well , when the king is avc in a capture square , this is ic called check .
the king can not be ic in check .
so take ic it , block it , or move your king out of that square .
if you are avc the queen though and you have avc the king in front of you several spaces and the king still has avc several spaces to move backward , he can not move ic backward because he is avc still in check .
the queen can move ic further than one square .
if it is avc the pawn , he can just move ic anywhere .
usually take ic it .
so you want ic to check him until he cannot block avc it .
he cannot take ic it .
and he cannot move ic his king .
you cannot move ic into check .
so you guard ic all the squares .
and then you check ic him .
if both squares are avc guarded , he does ic not .
his color does not have ic anymore pieces .
if he has avc a pawn or something and the king cannot go avc anywhere , he can just move ic the pawn .
but if the pawn is avc captured too and he is avc just down to one piece , and he can not go avc anywhere , this is ic a draw .
you both win ic .
you both lose ic .
okay , is that it ?
checkmate is ic what you call nom it .
okay , now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
in other words , tell me everything you can think of about the game of chess so that someone who has never played before would know how to play .
that is ic a little harder .
cannot go ic off the board .
i will tell ic you that .
the bishop must stay ic on its same color .
there is ic no other way they can move nom .
rooks and bishops , , they can move ic unlimited squares unless it goes avc off the board in one direction .
it cannot move ic like a knight can where it is nom three down and in a different direction .
it is ic just one straight line .
otherwise , if a space is avc open , it can go ic all the way down the board .
so , there is ic that .
you cannot move ic into check when it is avc checkmate .
or the game is ic over .
if you put avc a guy in check , it depends avc on what game you are playing nom , you must say ic check .
if you were playing avc blitz or bughouse , you would not want ic to say that because it is avc capture the king , not checkmate .
so you would not want ic to say check .
if you are playing avc just a regular game , i think ic you have nom to say check .
i do not know ic .
you are thinking of different rules you would teach someone ?
i do ic not know , .
that is ic kind of what i was nom thinking .
no kibbitzing ic , which is rc telling another player rules , hanging over the board and saying “i see nom that” .
but that is ic not really a board rule .
so you cannot help a friend .
not really .
i did ic that .
i thought it was ic totally unfair .
we were having ic a bug house tournament at chess club .
and one kid was ic left out .
he had ic everybody go into two groups .
and you play ic bughouse with everybody .
but one kid did not have ic a partner .
so he teamed ic up with jerry , which is rc our chess teacher .
and then we played ic jerry and then someone else .
so i played ic jerry .
what i thought and my friend played ic really a kind of bad guy , one of the lower people in our higher group .
and i thought it was ic just so unfair .
jerry was ic like telling the guy all the moves like move nom here , get nom your knights out , check nom him .
it is ic like “you can not do nom that” .
so then , eventually , with jerry's help , the kid beat ic my partner .
and i lost ic .
it is ic like “you are nom evil” .
it is ic not fair .
you cannot play ic the other game for him .
so that stank ic .
, i do not know ic very many other rules .
now tell me what a player should do to win the game of chess .
in other words , what are some key strategies that every good player should know ?
do not expose ic your king .
when a piece is avc threatened , like when this piece cannot take avc your piece , do not leave ic it unprotected .
where , if one of your pieces can get avc taken by the other guy that is ic bad .
if one of your pieces can be avc taken by you that is ic good because it is avc guarded , meaning if one piece took avc that piece that you could take rc also , which you really cannot do avc in the game , you could just take nom it too .
if it is a queen avc and your queen is guarded avc , well guarding your queen is ic not too much because your queen is avc probably the best piece .
so you can trade ic a really good piece like a rook for a queen .
it would not really be ic a trade .
but you would want ic to give away any piece but a queen really or a king for a queen because your guarding it it is avc kind of pointless .
but guarding a rook would be ic good .
never guard ic a pawn if it is avc threatening , because you have avc eight pawns .
and people really do not care ic about them .
you promote ic them at the end and turn them into a queen or whatever piece you want rc to .
then it is ic good .
but you cannot turn ic it into another pawn or a king .
you cannot do ic that .
any piece than those ones .
, you do not really guard ic anything when your pawn is avc threatening .
well , that is ic a strategy .
you can check ic a .
when you are avc in a hole or something and you got avc one good piece or something , try to use ic that piece to check their king .
or forks .
forks are ic good .
it is ic where you have nom a queen and you can put nom it in between like two pawns .
it is ic like you say nom this pawn and you move nom it here and i just take nom that one .
so that is ic what a fork is nom , a choice , an option .
sometimes it does not work ic too well .
it works ic well for the pawns sometimes .
castling is ic another thing .
it is ic the only time a king gets nom to jump a piece and a rook gets nom no one time a king can move nom two squares and a rook can jump nom a piece .
you move ic your king two squares and then first got to move avc your king two squares because if you did avc it the other way you would be nom a rook moving and the pieces would be nom the other way around .
only that would be ic your move .
the rook can go ic that many squares .
so it would be ic kind of like your move .
once the king and the rook though are moved avc you cannot ic .
well if the kings moved avc , you cannot ic castle at all .
if this rook is moved avc you just cannot ic castle on that side .
anyway , so you move ic your king two squares .
and you put ic your rook over him right next to him .
so that is ic castling .
so that is ic bad .
you want to do ic it at the end more .
if you move avc all those pawns away then your king is ic more exposed .
so , that is ic that question .
i guess ic .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
if you place avc two grandmasters to face each other , it takes ic maybe an hour .
if you put avc me to a three year old , i could beat ic him pretty quickly .
there is ic a few checkmates that are rc really quick , the four move and the two move .
you use ic those on beginners who do not know rc what they are nom doing .
but both of those , you got ic kind of work together .
it is ic not a good thing .
they got ic to not know what you are in nom doing .
the four move is ic kind of common .
the two move is ic not .
the four move is ic like i am nom just going to move this pawn two and this pawn one .
it is ic like checkmate , .
they have ic to do that .
so the two move is ic pretty uncommon .
the four move would happen ic more often .
but all they need ic to do is move a particular pawn or a knight or a queen .
only the queen would not help ic much .
it is ic like one small move .
and it is ic ruined .
, i do not ic know .
those are ic some pretty quick games .
it kind of depends ic how you match nom them up .
if you match avc a grandmaster to a beginner , the grandmaster beats ic the beginner .
if you match avc two grandmasters up , it could take ic a long time .
it takes ic my dad and i , about maybe thirty minutes depending on how good either of us are playing nom .
but when i am avc tired , he beats ic me .
he usually beats ic me even if i am avc trying to play my best game .
sometimes i can beat him ic .
but it is ic pretty uncommon .
it takes ic about an hour , thirty minutes , twenty minutes , or about two minutes .
what makes a game last a long time ?
a game last ic a long time when two people who are rc pretty equal at just , about .
they are ic both , like one to one on the chess ladder .
but who knows ic .
maybe this one is ic better than that one .
so this one could beat ic one , two , three , four , all those people even though it is avc the best .
the best player on your team could be ic so bad so that everyone below him is avc even worse .
that is ic all .
, usually two equally ranked people .
what make a game end quickly ?
unevenly ranked people makes ic a game end quickly .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
yes i do ic .
can you tell me about it ?
when you can play ic up to an hour on it .
an hour is ic kind of your limit if you are avc using just a clock .
i like ic the wooden ones better .
but you can also use ic digital .
wooden is ic kind of like the clock on the wall .
on the twelve there is ic going to be a little flaggy thingy , a little pin ball whacker kind of thing on there and .
you are going to you can kind of like twist ic your one .
there is ic like two of those things .
there is ic only one hand .
you can twist ic it for however long .
put it ic there , like right next to the thing , on this side , like right here .
that would be ic one hour .
if you do avc it here it would be ic like one minute .
so if you put avc it on the ten it would be ic like a ten minute game .
so it is ic however long it takes nom to get the hand hits the flag thing .
it will be ic pushing it .
it is ic really light .
once the flag drops avc , if you just do not call avc flag , the game is going ic to keep going .
but if you call avc flag , you win ic .
the person who ran rc out of time would lose ic .
that is ic how a clock works nom .
when you move avc a piece , you hit ic the clock with the same hand that you moved rc with .
i kind of get ic that wrong sometimes .
but i do ic not care really .
we are ic not really focused on that right now in chess club .
so , you can ic play a touch move and release move .
those are ic some special moves .
but in this case , clock move , you can touch ic it .
you can move ic .
you can ic release .
it does ic not matter until you touch avc the clock .
once you touch avc the clock , that is ic your move .
so that is ic it .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess ?
if you ask avc me more questions , i will answer ic them .
no more questions .

can you name any famous chess players ?
can you tell me something about one of them ?
i do not know ic any famous chess players .
do you ever play chess on a computer ?
and if you do can you tell me about that ?
i tried ic once .
but it did ic not work .
it does ic not like .
i tried ic getting one online .
but it did not work ic .
did not work so i do not play ic chess on a computer .
how come it did not work .
i do not know ic .
i tried ic like doing it .
and like the internet was ic messing up or something .
and , now tell me why you enjoy chess ?
because it is ic like a strategy game .
and it is ic not like lucky .
you can not get ic lucky if you really know avc that game .
you have to when you win avc , it is ic because you are avc smart .
it is ic not just because you were avc just lucky and you rolled avc the dice and it was avc randomly that you won nom .
it is ic more of a skill game .
i'm not too familiar with the game of chess .
you probably know a lot more about it than i do so i'd like you to explain some things to me .
just like anything ?
i'll just ask you some questions .
first of all how many people play the game of chess at one time ?
the chess club ?
if you are playing a game of chess , how many people can play at once ?
, two .
i have heard of simultaneous matches .
do you know what that is ?
can you explain it to me ?
simultaneous .
do you mean ic like when there is avc different .
yes .
chess ?
it is like it is ic like an alternate version of chess .
we call ic it bug house .
and it is you do not play ic by the rules .
you play ic like by a different set of rules .
and like it is ic two different people .
like and you are ic on a team .
like the person across from you are ic on a team with like like .
and someone else is playing ic .
and then you play ic with someone else .
and then and then like when you take avc out one of your pawn pieces you give ic it to him .
and he gets ic to place it on the board .
so you do not play ic by the rules with those games .
tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move .
there is ic the pawn .
and you can move ic it two spaces forward on the first try .
and and after that it can only move ic up once .
and it can it can take ic out pieces diagonally one one space .
and then the rook can can move ic any space horizontal or vertical as much as it wants avc .
but it like cannot jump ic over pieces .
and then the knight can .
it moves ic like in an l pattern like three i think up and like one to the left to the right or anything in an l pattern .
and it can jump ic pieces .
and the queen can move ic anywhere like diagonally or vertically or horizontal .
and but it can not jump ic pieces not like the knight just one way .
and the king can just move ic one square anywhere .
and the bishop can move ic any space diagonally on its color .
now tell me about the goals of chess .
in other words what are the players trying to do ?
beat ic the other player .
take out ic their king .
that is that is ic the whole point is nom get the to take get the out the king .
but a lot of times you have to like kill ic a lot of pieces to do that .
now tell me about the rules that players need to follow .
in other words tell me everything you can think of about the game of chess so that someone who has never played before would know how to play .
all the rules that they need to know .
like what i just described ic to you ?
well you just take ic turns playing .
you just take ic turns moving a piece .
and like you get ic to so you just take nom turns .
and then like the objective is ic to just trying and take out the king .
like i do not know ic how to explain .
but you just you are ic just not really supposed to talk .
it is ic kind of like a quiet game .
i mean ic you can nom .
but if you want avc it to be serious you just do ic not really talk .
now i would like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess .
in other words what are some key strategies that every good player should know ?
if you if you do avc it is ic good to learn some like some defensive strategies to try to arrange your pieces in ways that they are rc hard to crack like hard to get through and break through .
without them getting like that is probably then you have to always stay ic on the offensive because other people people will play avc off of you .
and get .
and just keep advancing ic over and over and over .
and offensive you have you have to be like be kind of be ic defensive .
and the same time you study ic your moves and try thinking several moves ahead .
that is ic pretty much what everyone does nom .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
maybe like an hour or thirty minutes .
well it depends ic .
like like the chess teacher that comes rc , like he came ic .
and we like spent ic like well he came we spent like an hour and a half on it .
we spent ic like an hour and a half playing .
and we did not even like get ic close to finishing .
we just had to had to save save ic the game and come back to it like .
i have only beat ic him once because he is avc really hard .
what makes a game last a long time ?
if you take avc like a lot time between moves then it is ic not just like a big flurry of activity .
you just it is ic kind of like dancing around a lot .
and what makes a game end quickly or be short ?
if you do ic not like pay attention .
if you do ic not pay attention .
and if you just like just fool ic around .
or if you do not know ic how to play chess .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
can you tell me about it ?
well when we went avc to a tournament one time , we had to if if they want avc you to go fast , they give ic you a like chess clock thing .
and after after every one of your moves , you push ic a button on the clock on your side of the clock .
and it switches ic to your opponents time .
and if if you have avc thirty minutes like if you run out avc of time like you only get ic like thirty minutes for your game to complete .
and if you like the objective is ic to have to like you have to move fast like in the end .
because if they they get you if you run out avc of time first you lose ic .
so you have ic to play the game out of time .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess ?
anything at all .
not really .
it is ic fun .
before we talk about chess i'd learn like to learn something about you .
so i am going to ask you a few general questions .

okay , now i'd like to talk to you about chess .

okay .
basically a year .
how old were you when you first started to play ?
like , eight i think ic .

i do not know ic .
it was ic kind of a long time ago .
do you have a chess rating ?
six eighty eight .
six eighty eight ?
awesome .
do you have a chess coach or a teacher ?
well i had ic basically two .
and one of them's name is ic ron .
but we call ic him ronzi .
and the other one's name is ic jerry .
can you tell me anything else about them ?
they are ic really strict and good .
they are ic really good .
like , my brother has only beat ic them once .
because jerry made ic a blunder .
but and his face turned ic red , apparently .
really ?
so , .
jerry teaches ic at chessways in the vets club .
so we go ic there because my brother is taking lessons on tuesday , wednesday , thursday .
i think ic .
and so , when he goes avc there after school , i have to go ic too .
so , very cool .
do you belong to a chess club ?
the one at my school .
it is ic very unorganized .
how often do you play chess , say , in a typical week ?
almost everyday .
okay !
who do you play with the most ?
the most ?
probably my family .
your family ?
can you name any famous chess players ?
not right now .
i just stick to playing ic chess .
okay .
do you ever play chess on a computer ?
can you tell me about that ?
well , it has been ic awhile since i have avc done it .
just you go ic on a computer .
and it is ic under favorites .
but because we put my dad put ic it under favorites .
and so , like , it is ic a game that some other guy is playing rc .
and he is ic really good .
so and then you can make ic your move .
and he makes ic his move and his move .
and i think ic you can use nom tactics too .
very cool .
now will you tell me why you enjoy chess .
sometimes it can be ic relaxing .
sometimes it can be ic really an urge .
like i want ic to get this guy .
i know ic i can nom .
well , i'm not too familiar with the game of chess .
you probably know a lot more about it than i do .
so i would like you to explain some things to me .
first of all , how many people may play a game of chess at one time ?
two .
and i've heard of simultaneous matches .
do you know what that is ?
, it is ic where one person plays avc two or more people at one time .
okay .
will you tell me about the different pieces and how they're supposed to move ?
okay .
then to attack , they move ic diagonal .
the rooks go ic like , this way and this way so they would just go like .
if they are here avc , they could go ic here or here .
or here .
the knights can go ic , people call nom it the l shape .
but i like to say ic up one , diagonal one .
so if it would be avc here , then you would go ic up one , diagonal one .
okay .
so and then , bishops go ic diagonal on their color .
okay .
and the kings can go ic any direction only one space .
queens can go ic any direction as many spaces .
and that is ic all the pieces .
okay , thank you .
now tell me about the goals of chess .
in other words , what are the players trying to do ?
checkmate the other person's king .
what is checkmate ?
checkmate is ic where you put the king in check .
it is ic where your next move your going to take it .
so then you would say ic check .
and they cannot move ic .
okay .
so it would beat ic you .
okay thank you .
now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
in other words , tell me everything you can think about the game of chess .
so that someone who has never played before would know how to play .
this one is ic tough .
well the how the pieces move .
there is ic a move called castling .
it is ic where , so your king might be avc here and your rook is avc here .
and you have not moved ic your rook or your king .
you can do ic this on both sides .
but i would do ic it king side most of the time .
so you would move ic your king two spaces towards your rook and your rook three spaces .
so , it would be ic king here , rook here .
king and then rook .
and there is ic a move called en passant .
and it is ic where the one person moves their pawn up two .
and then another person moves ic something .
and then they move ic that pawn up again .
then the person who moved rc it three could move ic it diagonally and take that pawn .
it is ic just basically moving around trying not to lose your queen too early .
do not move ic your queen out too early .
, my brother has done ic that a million times .
and just try ic to checkmate the king .
okay , now i would like you to tell me a player or what a player should do in order to win the game of chess .
in other words , what are some key strategies that every good player should know ?
knights before bishops .
that means ic you move nom your knights out before your bishops .
and development .
development ?
can you tell me more about development ?
development is ic where you have all your pieces .
so it is ic rook , knight , bishop , king , queen , bishop , knight , rook , and then pawns .
eight pawns .
so you move ic the pawns and the king out two spaces .
pawns and the queen out two spaces .
your knights out to the center .
and your bishops go ic out next to your pawns .
and then you move ic your queen either up one or diagonal one .
and then your king is ic ready to cast on both sides .
okay , awesome .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
well it really does depend ic .
like you do ic scholars mate .
then it is ic like three for you .
it would be ic pawns out like bishop , bishop on a white horse out to guard that guard rc the pawns by attacking and moving the queen out in front of the pawn that in front was rc in front of the bishop .
and then move ic the queen up that side when you take avc the pawn .
and you say ic check .
and they cannot take ic you .
because the bishop is guarding ic you .
okay , so that would be a really fast game then ?
, and other games called pawn games , i guess you would say , then it's just you are moving ic .
and it is ic just this steady game .
okay .
what makes the game last long a long time ?
i think ic the one person not checkmating as early and not trading pieces so fast .
because sometimes when you are playing avc a game , all your pieces will be ic taken away .
and the other person can just go ic and checkmate you .
okay , i see .
so , what makes the game end more quickly ?
what makes the game end quickly ?
what would be a short game ?
losing all your pieces quickly .
hmm .
like , i did ic that once in a tournament .
and i lost ic the game .
and so then the other person just got ic down on me .
it was ic hard .
okay .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
hmm .
i have ic one .
can you tell me about it ?
, okay , so you set ic it .
well there is ic two different kinds .
there is ic digital .
and there is ic , like , a clock .
okay .
so , i prefer ic digital .
because then you do not have to set ic it actually .
but you move ic the switch .
and there is ic a switch usually on the bottom or the side or something .
and then you turn ic it on .
and it is ic usually at ten minutes and two seconds .
and the two seconds is ic just an extra two seconds .
but you can set ic it for different times .
you if you want ic to play blitz , that would be five minutes .
do you know ic what blitz is nom ?
i don't .
blitz is ic a five minute game where you do not say check rc .
and you do not want ic to say check .
you should not have ic to say check .
because you want ic to take their king .
it's not you do not want ic to checkmate them .
if you can put avc them in check , and you do not say avc check , they will not know ic , usually .
because they do not see ic it .
and then your next move , you can take ic the king away .
, cool .
and if you run avc out of time , you lose ic on all clocked games .
okay .
also so you would just set ic it .
and then when it's , so it white always moves ic first .
so black would push ic their button .
and it would start start ic counting down on white's time .
once they move avc , they hit ic the clock .
starts counting down on black's time .
and it just keeps ic going back and forth after each move .
okay .
very cool .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess ?
i do not know ic .
i think ic that is , , i know there is nom a lot of chess books .
lots and lots .
have you read some of them ?
i have ic read a little bit of some .
we got my dad orders ic them on i think it is amazon dot com or something .
so he got ic this huge one .
it is ic like this big .
so .
and it is ic heavy .
it is ic all of the chess tactics .
that sounds exciting .
what do the books what do they tell you ?
do they give you clues or tips or ?
they give ic you tips , strategies .
they there is ic a lot of tactics in them that you can do nom .
what are tactics ?
tactics are ic problems that just chess problems .
so , it gives ic position .
and you have to find ic a way to checkmate the king in maybe three moves or something .
okay .
so that would be ic a tactic .
it does not have to be ic in a certain number of moves .
it is ic just a chess problem , like a math problem .
except it is ic in chess .
so there is ic just a lot a lot of books .
very exciting .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess ?
there is i have ic my own book .
and it is ic called chess tactics for students .
and it is ic a book of all chess tactics .
and i am ic not sure what the first chapter is nom .
but i know ic the third chapter is nom knight forks .
so that is ic where you would have nom the knight here , maybe .
and then there would be ic two pieces , say your bishop and the queen .
and your knight moves ic here .
then which one the person has to choose ic which one they want nom .
say ic they go nom with their bishop .
and they did not know ic it was nom their queen .
so then i could take ic the queen .
if they move avc the queen , then i can take ic the bishop .
so it is ic forking both pieces .
i see .
that is ic the one i am on .
i am ic almost to chapter four .
it is ic called other forks and something else .
i do not know ic .
but then there is ic , like , twenty one chapters maybe .
it is ic pretty long .
so it is ic all tactics .
all tactics .
okay .
and there is nom a book called junior tactics i think ic .
and it is ic a book of all tactics .
does it take you a long time to read them ?
sorta .
it is ic the kind you do not really read them .
well , i mean , you read ic what there has to say nom .
like , it tells ic you what you have to do nom .
and then it might tell ic you how nom or a hint to do nom it .
and then there is ic spaces .
and since my brother might use avc the book , i do not write ic in the book .
i have ic a notebook that i would note take nom the things the notes in for the tactics , instead of writing rc them in the book .
, that makes sense .
okay well thanks again for talking with me today .

i am ic not sure where he went nom .
okay .
so he taught you how to play .
but you said he went to state , right ?
i'm not sure , what's that ?
is that is there like a regional tournaments then a state tournament or ?
there's a i think ic there is nom state and a .

cause they have the they have the oregon open here .

i like your t-shirt , that's great .
okay thanks so much coby .
thank you .
, have a good day .
bye bye .
okay , thanks coby .
it's fun .
alright .
thank you .
so i'm , i'm not too familiar with the game of chess .
you probably know a lot more about it than i do .
so i'd like you to explain some of the things to me , the rules and stuff .
first of all how many people may play a game of chess at one time ?
a normal game of chess ?
two .
i've heard of simultaneous matches .
do you know what that is ?
no .
okay .
tell me the tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move .
i've heard that they move differently .
like name each kind ?
well , the pawns , like , at the beginning they can ic either move one or two squares forward only .
and the bishop can only can only move ic diagonally , if there is adv nothing in its way , forward or backwards .
the rooks can move ic anywhere in a straight line which hmm your left , right , straight or backwards , if nothing is adv in their way .
queens can go is ic like a rook and a bishop and if .
she can go ic anywhere unless it is adv not backwards , forwards , if it is adv not in her way .
and kings can move ic anywhere one square like diagonally or anything .
and the knights are ic harder to explain .
you like you go ic one , two .
and then you have ic to move one direction either left or right so .
so now can you tell me the goals of chess .
in other words what are the players trying to do ?
they are trying ic to get their king in checkmate , which is rel where either two or more , well two or more pieces help nom with it which .
it is ic where the king can not go nom anywhere in the aiming point of a piece .
so like , it can not be ic diagonally of a bishop or it has to move .
or anywhere else in checkmate is ic where when you get it either pinned adv or something cornered and you can not move nom anywhere .
the king ?
now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
in other words , tell me everything you can think of about the game of chess so that someone who has never played before would know how to play .
like the rules of .
well in professional chess , like when you put adv your hand on a piece , you have ic to move it .
and you let go adv of the piece , it has ic to stay there .
you can not redo ic it .
okay , , that's interesting .
so any other any other pieces about the rules , or like how hmm different pieces can move with other pieces in the way ?
well the knight doesn't , it just if the space is adv open it can move ic .
it can jump ic over anything .
so it can jump pieces ?
so can any other pieces do that or ?
it is ic just the knight .
now i'd like to , like you to tell me what the player should do in order to win the game of chess .
in other words , what are some key strategies every good player should know ?
always try ic to keep your queen .
and always have ic like a wall of some kind from around your king , so no one can check adv or checkmate you .
so you want to protect your , keep your queen at all costs ?
well , it depends ic and if you want adv to do queen for queen .
that way it gets rid of their .
so that would you want to get a queen for a different piece ?
it depends ic on whether it is nom to win the game or not .
okay .
so if you were like close to the end .
so how long does it take to play a game of chess ?
for me , like either fifteen to half an hour .
and what makes a game last a long time ?
in facing a equal skilled opponent .
makes sense .
what makes a game end quickly , a real short game ?
they make the other players make ic mistakes .
makes sense .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
i do not like ic those .
why not ?
cause i usually like ic taking taking time to think about strategies .
so it's a chess can you tell me what it is , more about it .
i don't think i've ever heard of if .
the clock ?
like , you have , it's your , you know i do not really know ic the rules about it .
but you have a certain i think ic you have nom a certain amount of time to move a piece and or your pieces to win the game .
and every time you are done rel moving a piece you have ic to hit the clock which activates adv the other person's clock .
it keeps ic going back and forth .
okay .
i can see why you don't like it , if you , with the , if you want to think about strategies .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess ?
the board always has ic the white square in the right , .
i'm sorry .
what did you say honey ?
at the beginning of the match when you set up adv your pieces a white square is ic always on the right corner , right corner bar .
hmm .
and the queen is ic always on her colored square .
so the king is on the opposite colored square ?
well , .
cause , it's on a checker board isn't it ?
tell us about strategies , any other strategies coby that you can think of ?
i bet you know a lot about strategies .
i am ic not sure .
like how would you start a game ?
is there different ways to start a game ?
usually i would start ic a game with a moving a pa like the pawn that is rel in front of one of my bishops , like on the left side of it so it is adv like pawned that sits rel .
so the i would move ic the one of the pawns that are rel in front of a knight and move a , then after their move move a bishop right there .
so like if they move adv a pawn that is rel in front of like diagonally in front of their rook , and if they move adv it they can't i will not get hit ic .
my bishop will not die ic .
and his rook will die ic unless he does not have adv another pawn that can defend rel it .
it works ic on either side .
so you do the left side .
is there a reason you do the left side instead of the right or ?
well , there is ic no difference .
it is ic just taking out one of their rooks .
so you you said the bishops move diagonally .
so does that put that in the line of the .
so is there any other strategies for starting the game or ?
well , if the person is adv like new to the game , the three move one ic .
that is ic where you put the you move nom a pawn that is rel by their by the queen and the another bishop .
i think it's i am ic not sure what side it is nom on .
but you move ic your bishop out so it is adv like diagonally from like one of the squares from where the queen is nom going to be .
the queen moves out ic either diagonally .
or it goes ic out diagonally to either the square that is rel right in front of the i think it's the bishop .
and you , and when you if you attack adv it , when , with since there are adv no defenses from the king , the king can not attack ic the queen cause the bishop will put adv it in check .
i should play this game , it sounds like fun .
do you have anything else you want to tell me about chess or ?
hmm not that i can think ic of .
not that you can think of .
well thanks for talking to me today .
is there anything else ?
nope , not unless coby has anything else .
thank you very much coby .
, thank you very much .

i do not get ic very much time to .
i do ic a lot of music .

and i also like ic to read kind of action books not so much science fiction cuz i am adv not so much into science .
what are the “warrior” series about ?
cats .
really ?
what do they do ?
it is talking ic about four different clans of cats .
and they lived ic in a forest .
but they are ic on their fourteenth or fifteenth book now .
so they have moved ic to different forests .
but , so they have ic different clan rivalries and different ranks like the leaders and the hunters and different things like that .
, cool .
that's crazy .
do you read magazines at all ?
not very much .
no ?
do you want to ask me any questions ?
no , sorry .
that's okay .
now i would like to ask you about chess .
how long have you played chess ?
well , i played ic since third grade .
so i guess ic this would be nom my fourth year .
but i did not play ic for a year .
okay .
so how old were you when you started to play ?
i think ic i must have been nom seven .
seven ?
who taught you how to play chess ?
the chess club at the school , i do not remember ic the coaches name though .
it has been ic a long time .
what school was it ?
assumption catholic school it was ic in washington .
okay , , do you have a chess rating ?
yes for northwest it is ic about a thousand right now .
do you have a chess coach or teacher ?
yes , i learned ic from chuck shulian and carl hesler .
okay , can you tell me about them ?
chuck is more of , , well i guess ic carl is nom more of the strategic player .
but chuck teaches ic more of the positions and how to figure out what is going nom on in the positions where carl is more a he teaches us how to use the positions and to figure out what is supposed nom to happen like , for end , middle , and beginnings .
what are middle and beginnings ?
well at the beginning of the game we have ic to set up our strong position .
and we have ic to put our pieces on the best squares .
and then middle of the game we can , depending on our position and what opening we used rel , we can decide ic either to try and end the game there or to go to an end game where there is nom generally not many pieces and you are using nom your king a lot and the pawns .
okay , can you tell me anything else about chuck and carl ?
they are ic both very laid back .
and they love ic teaching .
really ?
so they do it together ?
they coach together ?
occasionally yes , but normally they will take ic like one month at a time .
and i take ic lessons from chuck outside of the chess club .
okay .
awesome .
do you belong to a chess club ?
yes , the one at school .
okay .
what's it called ?
isb dragon knights .
perfect .
how often do you play chess , say , in a typical week ?
well , i guess ic every monday for lessons .
and there is ic generally a tournament every other weekend .
okay .
who do you play with the most ?
my team members .
i used to play ic with my dad a lot .
but i have gotten ic a lot better .
so , my teammates .
okay .
can you name any famous chess players ?
there was ic karpov and , .
i do not really know ic that many .
i am ic more of a positional person instead of actually looking at the openings .
so i do not get ic to study a lot of that .
okay .
can you tell me anything about karpov ?
no , not really .
i just see ic him on a poster a lot .
cuz when we go adv to this tournament , it happens ic every other weekend .
there is ic a big poster there of him .
, okay .
that's funny .
i know ic he was nom a chess master .
he was ic the chess champion for awhile .
but that is ic it .
really ?
okay , cool .
do you ever play chess on a computer ?
yes .
can you tell me about what that's like ?
it is ic a little bit different .
cuz a lot of times when you are playing adv chess you can read ic what the opponent is doing nom just by looking at their faces .
and also with the computer they are ic a lot smarter .
, and it is ic a little bit different cuz you do not really get adv the excitement of playing against them .
so it is ic a little bit easier to concentrate .
do you , , is the computer , whoever you're playing against a lot harder , or is it ?
the program that i use rel is ic chess master ten thousand .
so it , you can choose ic the rating or your opponent .
so you can play ic against masters or four hundred ratings .
actually , you can have ic people with ten ratings , which is rel really bad .
but so i generally just choose ic ratings around mine .
and then i keep going up ic about every five games .
okay .
is it , so do you think it's harder than , so you said you think its harder .
probably easier than playing against opponents .
okay .
now tell me why you enjoy chess .
i enjoy ic it for the social part of it cuz i get adv to talk to a lot of people and also cuz it can help adv me in school .
it has helped ic a lot in math .
and also i get ic to go different places for the nationals .
this year i will be going ic to texas so .
, fun .
tell me about how it helps you with math .
with math , it is ic different things like understanding .
so , i will ic have to understand how different things work nom in chess .
and then i will also have ic to understand things like algorithms and things like that in math too .
that's interesting .
so what are some of the other places you have traveled ?
last year for nationals we were ic in sacramento .
and the year before that it was ic in dallas .
and for the oregon state this year we will be going to we will be going ic to the coast .
so we will get ic to stay on the beach and everything .
fun , when is that ?
march , so everything is ic kinda right around my birthday .
that's fun .
that will be a good birthday present then .
okay .
do you have any other reasons why you enjoy chess ?
i just enjoy ic it cuz it is adv something fun to do and it is kinda i can kind of enjoy adv my time there and it just it is kinda easier to , well it's not easier , but it is better than sitting at home and like watching tv or something .
well i'm not too familiar with game of chess .
you probably know a lot more about it than i do .
so i would like you to explain some things to me if that's okay .
first of all , how many people can play a game of chess at one time ?
two people .
two ?
i've heard of “simultaneous matches” , do you know what that is ?
i think it is , , okay .
it is ic where there is nom one person who is rel one opponent and there is nom a whole bunch of boards set up .
so they will play ic against every board .
so they will walk ic around .
and they will play ic .
so they might be ic all white for each of the boards .
or they might be ic black for each of them .
so they are playing ic against ten or however many opponents .
so they are playing each board at the same time ?
yes .
i bet that is hard .
you have to remember a lot of things going on .
tell me about the different pieces and how they're supposed to move .
pawns they move ic forward one square generally unless it is adv the first time that they are moving rel .
they can move ic two squares .
and they take ic pieces diagonally .
knights , they move ic in an l shape , so over one square up two or forward whichever direction it is rel moving in .
rooks move ic sideways and up and down .
so they just kinda go ic across .
and the bishops move ic diagonally on whatever color they started rel on .
so if they started adv on the black square , they are going ic to be black for the rest of the game .
same with white .
the queens , they can move ic forward , backward , sideways , and diagonally .
and the king can only move ic one square at a time in any direction .
so that is ic all the pieces .
okay , , now tell me about the goals of chess .
in other words , what are the players trying to do .
the players are trying ic to checkmate their opponent .
so they would so when you check adv a piece it is ic like you are going nom to take it the next turn you get rel .
so you can you are trying ic to checkmate .
but other outcomes can be ic stalemate , where the opponent can not move rel any of their pieces without getting themselves in check or making illegal moves .
and there is ic a draw also .
it depends ic on what types of circumstances there are rel .
like , if there is adv just two kings at the end of the game , you can not stalemate with a , i mean you can not checkmate ic with a king or stalemate .
so each opponent gets ic half a point .
so you are trying ic to checkmate .
but you can get ic different outcomes .
so if you checkmate a player can they not move their piece that you are going to get then ?
, you're , well i will explain ic that a little bit more clearly .
the king is ic the piece that you are trying rel to checkmate .
so if you're if it is adv like you move nom your piece and then they are attacking nom that piece so that they would take adv them the next turn that you get rel and then the king can not move nom anywhere , there is nom no pieces that could block rel it without being illegal illegally moved , and there is nom no pieces that can take rel that piece , then it is ic checkmate .
okay .
are there any other goals of chess that you can think of ?
well that is ic for the game .
but generally you want ic to try and get better so move your rating up more .
how do you improve your rating ?
at tournament so it depends ic on how many games there are rel and who you are playing nom .
so if you are playing adv better people and you win adv against them for the majority of your games , then your rating will go ic up .
and if you win adv against lower rated people , it will not go ic up as much .
but if you lose adv to lower people , then your rating will go ic down .
but if you lose adv against the higher people it does not really make ic a difference that much , maybe like one or two points .
, okay .
can you tell me about the rules that players need to follow .
in other words , tell me everything you can think of about the game of chess so that someone , like me , whose never played before would know how to play .
you have ic to move the pieces the way that they are supposed rel to be moved .
and you can not make ic illegal moves with them .
you can not try ic to distract your opponent while you are playing adv .
and you can not , well depending on what tournament you are at rel if there is adv “touch move” and it is when you touch adv your piece you have ic to move that piece if you legally can adv .
and , there is ic “touch take” which if you touch adv your opponent's piece and you have nom to take that piece if you legally can adv also .
and , you can not sabotage ic their notation .
so when you are notating adv it is , there is ic a , b , c , d , e , f , g , h and one through eight on the sides .
so you can notate ic what square and what piece is nom being moved .
this has happened ic at tournaments .
if you sabotage adv your opponent's notation and they find out adv so that it would make adv it so that you would win nom the game , you would forfeit ic .
and if there is adv timing , so that there is adv clocks , like you might have nom like thirty minutes on each clock , and if you run adv out of time then you generally lose ic unless there is adv a position where your opponent does not have nom sufficient mating material .
and it would be ic a draw then .
and you can only press ic the clock with the hand that you have been moving rel your pieces with .
and you you are ic supposed to try and keep touching the pieces with the same hand each time .
and you can not change ic the pieces when a player is adv not looking .
and you are ic only allowed to go to the bathroom on your own time .
and you are only allowed ic to move on your own time .
so you would move ic the piece .
and you would press ic your clock .
you are ic not allowed to touch your opponent's pieces unless you are adv taking them .
and , if you are going adv to try and touch your piece without trying to move it , then you have ic to say “i adjust” nom first .
and , you can not touch ic your opponent's clock .
and , you can not move ic your opponent's pieces .
i think ic i might have said nom that already .
there's a lot of rules .
and then for if you do not see adv if it is nom a checkmate or a stalemate and your opponent makes an illegal move adv and you do not notice adv it until the end of the game , then it is ic still the same outcome .
and when you mark adv it down who wins nom and who loses nom you can not come back ic later and say actually that was nom not right .
it is ic the final outcome the way you mark rel it .
and , if you change adv the way the pieces are set up rel at the beginning of the game and it stays adv like that for the first ten moves then it stays ic like that for the rest of the game .
and , also if the if you move your piece wrong , well i guess that would be an illegal move so if you move adv illegally and it stays adv like for the rest of the game then it stays ic like that .
and , if you see adv another game going on and they say it is checkmate adv but it is nom not or vice versa , then you can not tell ic them that is nom what is going nom on .
so you have ic to let them do their own outcome .
parents can not help ic the games at tournaments .
neither can friends ic .
and i don't know .
that is ic all i can think rel of right now .
but there is ic probably a lot more .
that's a lot of rules .
is it hard to remember all of them ?
, sometimes .
so , you will make ic accidental things happen in the game .
are all those rules , do you use all those rules when you're just playing for fun also ?
generally , unless things like “touch take” and , , “touch move” different things like that depends ic who what friend you are playing rel with .
like if it is adv a fun game against like your coach or something , then they will try ic to enforce those rules .
but there is ic different rules like if it is nom just your regular friends .
, that makes sense .
now i would like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess .
in other words , what are some key strategies that every good player should know .
well , first in the beginning you have to well in the openings , beginnings , you have ic to get a stable position , which would be putting rel your pieces on good squares , having pawn structure , having more time , which is having rel your pieces out , having more pieces out than your opponent , having more force , which is how many pieces are pointed rel at your king , and the opponent's king .
and then time , force , space .
you want ic to have more space on your opponent's side of the board .
so after the middle then you want ic to have more pieces that can be attacking rel squares on your opponent's side of the board .
and in the middle game you want ic to try to get more of those advantages if possible and try to either checkmate and move to an end game .
and to get there you would trade ic off your pieces .
you only generally want ic to trade off your pieces if you are adv ahead in material .
and in the end game you would , you would use ic your pawns to promote .
so when they get adv to the other side then you can choose ic what piece they want rel to be turned into , except for a pawn cuz that is adv what they were nom or a king , cuz you can not have adv two kings .
and , you would like ic to have your king centralized .
then it can help ic protect the pawns .
and to keep your opponent from promoting and to try to get your pawns promoted you want ic to either get your rooks on the seventh rank or behind your pawns or in front of your opponent's pawns .
and what we were working nom on right now in lessons was ic called two weaknesses where you create nom two weaknesses in your opponent's strategy , so that they might have adv a bunch of pawns on one side of the board and some more pawns on the other so you will attack adv one and you will attack adv the other at the same time , but they can only protect nom one .
so then you end ic up kind of making their position worse .
that is ic especially useful in end games .
so that is ic what we were working nom on right now .
and that is ic just kinda generally what you use nom to kind of better your positions .
so you were talking about the beginning , middle , and end games .
can you tell me more about that ?
the middle games , there is ic kind of more pieces on the board .
well , in the beginning there is ic definitely all the pieces on the board .
and there is ic different attacks going on and setting up different strategies so that you can attack adv or pin pieces so that they can not move adv or skewer pieces so that there is adv two important pieces and they can only move adv one of them to be safe .
and this is ic used in all of the parts of the game .
but in the middle game , there is ic kind of less pieces .
but there is ic still enough that there can be nom multiple attacks going on .
so , there is ic generally still a queen and a couple rooks on the board and other minor pieces like bishops and knights and a lot of pawns .
and you are trying ic to get your rooks in , on open files .
and pawns are trying ic to advance .
and the bishops are wanting ic to be on good and open diagonals .
and so are ic the queens .
and the king wants ic to be safe .
so , so you can castle ic so that your rook and three pawns are protecting adv your king .
is that the castle ?
, so that you'll switch the you will switch ic your rook and your king so that it is adv kind of in the corner by your rook in the back grain .
and there is ic different things that you can do rel with your pawns .
and different , depending on what opening you were rel in , there's going ic to be different positional types of things like isolated pawns and double pawns .
and for the end game , you are trying ic to get the promoted pawns .
so there will be ic different things like backwards pawns where the the only pawns that can protect rel it are nom already ahead of it and there will be nom a lot of isolated pawns .
you do not really want ic to have pawns on the side of the board because they are adv harder to promote and they're easier to , they are adv easier to attack and it is adv easier to get a stalemate with the side pawns .
and , if you do not have adv enough pieces to checkmate your opponent or promote a promote to get another piece , then you want ic to try and get a stalemate .
so you will put ic your pieces in positions where they will nom not be able to move anywhere .
or try ic to avoid the checkmate .
and in the openings , i already talked ic about openings .
so that is ic pretty much it .
okay , , strategies .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
well , one move is ic where you make nom a move and then your opponent makes nom a move .
so they can range ic anywhere up to a hundred .
well they can range ic however many moves .
my games usually take ic about thirty moves .
and the openings are generally you want ic all the pieces to be off the back rank into the squares by about the twelfth to fifteenth move .
and the openings , i mean not the opening the middle games and the end games can be started ic anywhere after that depending on how quickly you trade out the pieces .
like how long does that usually take ?
like , well after that it depends ic kind of what opening you did rel .
like , if you were doing adv more aggressive openings and it would trade adv off the pieces then you would be ic closer to an end game very quickly .
so you would probably be ic there by the twenty to thirtieth move .
but if you were doing adv more passive and closed openings , so there would be adv more pieces on the board and this would be adv more favorable cuz they could jump adv over different walls and things like that , then it would generally take ic a lot longer cuz you would have adv to study the positions more carefully and try to keep different attacks going at the same time and there would be adv more pieces on the board for a long time .
so that would be ic a longer game , like so forty moves at least .
okay .
what makes a game last a long time ?
you just kind of answered that .
and then tell me again what makes a game end quickly .
if you were aggressive you said .
there is ic open .
and there is ic closed positions .
so with the open positions the center is the , of the board is kinda there is ic not many pieces in the middle .
and there is ic not many pieces attacking it .
bishops are ic more favorable because there will be adv more open diagonals .
and , pawns are ic also better .
well pawns are ic better with open , sorry with closed positions because they can create adv walls .
and knights would be ic better in that position too because they can , they can protect adv and attack different , many different things at once .
and they can jump ic over walls .
and they can ic avoid attacks .
bishops are ic better for open because they can move adv quickly and they can get adv across the board in one move .
but knights take ic about three moves to get where you want nom to go .
okay .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
can you tell me about it .
so there is ic two different clocks .
and there is ic analog .
and there is ic digital .
so , the digital ones you can have ic delay on it so that at the beginning of your , .
there is ic two different types of delay .
there's ic at the beginning of your move they give nom you a certain amount of time , so maybe five seconds .
and then your time starts ic .
and then the second type of delay is ic after your move , they add nom on another five seconds .
so you might have started ic with five minutes .
but if you moved adv within , a certain like a couple seconds so then they would add ic time onto it .
so then you would have ic more time than with you started with .
and they have ic it so that as soon as you start adv your clock if there is adv no delay then it just keeps running nom down every second .
and if you have adv thirty minutes then it , once it gets adv to zero it stops ic .
then the game is ic over .
and the outcome depends ic on the position .
and so you make ic your move .
and then if you are notating adv , you notate ic before or after you move nom .
and then you press ic your clock .
but you can only press ic your side of the clock .
and for analog clocks they have ic it so that you just start nom the minute hand on one part .
and then it just goes ic around the clock .
and then there is ic a red flag five minutes before the one o'clock , so that the the minute hand will go nom around .
and then it will pass ic the flag .
and when it passes adv the flag , that is ic when your time is nom up .
, okay .
when you hit the clock what does it do ?
it stops ic your clock .
and it starts ic your opponent's clock .
okay .
is there anything else you can tell me about chess clocks ?
well there is ic a lot of different kinds .
like our club we have ic ones that have rel bigger buttons on them so it is adv easier to hit .
and there is ic different kinds of clocks .
the more expensive ones are ic kronos .
and they have they have ic heat sensors on them .
there is ic the heat sensor kind .
they are ic longer and skinnier .
and they are ic digital .
so they have ic the heat sense ones .
so if you touch it adv with the piece then it will not do ic anything .
you have ic to touch it with your hand .
and they have ic the regular types of clocks which just has rel the button .
okay .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess that you can think of ?
anything at all .
i think ic i pretty much said nom a lot .
before we talk about chess , i would like to learn something about you .

and then he just had ic his son or another helper help out for us in the advanced club and then this year in fifth grade he had avc his son be our coach for at chess week .

i used ic to .
but i do ic not any more .
can you tell me a little bit about that ?
well i had i do ic not remember what it is avc called but it was avc a game for beginners .
and you could ic do any thing like any kind of tactics like forks or anything that you wanted rc to or you could play avc a little game against the computer that is rc not very good .
you can play ic against someone really bad or better .
so i used ic to play on there .
and , now can you tell me why you enjoy chess ?
, i have ic no clue .
i just started ic young .
and i have ic liked it ever since .
i am not too familiar with the game of chess .
you probably know a lot more than i do .
so i would like you to explain some things to me .
first of all how many people can play of chess at one time ?
well on the same board , only two but in like tournaments there is ic a bunch of different boards , different people , so two on every board .
so there could be ic two hundred people in the same tournament .
so i have heard of simultaneous matches .
do you know what that is ?
can you explain that to me ?
that that is ic probably just like the tournaments where there is nom more than one game going on at the same time .
tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move .
well first are ic the rooks .
and that is ic all .
any length .
and then there is ic knights .
and they move ic in an l in any direction .
they can move ic in an l .
and besides that there is ic the bishops .
and they can move ic diagonally .
and then there is ic the queen and the king .
and the first one and the king can move ic one square once in any direction .
and the queen can move ic any amount of squares in one direction .
and the first one to capture the king wins ic .
now can you tell me about the goals of chess .
in other words , what are the players trying to do ?
capture the king .
now can you tell me the rules that players need to follow .
in other words , can you tell me everything you can think about the game of chess that someone who has never played before would know so they could know how to play .
that is ic a fair amount of rules .
let us see ic .
if your king is avc being attacked you have to move ic it out of that .
and if you cannot avc you could you have to block ic it .
and if you cannot avc you have ic to take the piece that is that is rc attacking your king .
and if you cannot avc then you lose ic because you are avc in checkmate and you cannot move avc anything but your king .
you cannot move ic a piece that a piece is rc attacking your king .
i cannot think ic of anything else .
just do ic what your pieces are allowed nom to .
okay now i would like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win the game .
in other words , what are some key strategies that every player good player should know ?
you want ic some spatial advantage .
so you want ic your pawns farther up so you have avc more space to attack .
you usually want ic your bishops out so they can avc attack more better more easily than if they are nom in close .
and knights if it is avc a close position position you would rather knight ic .
and if it is avc neither then they were ic not the same .
what was ic the question ?
what are some key strategies that every good player should know ?
start ic with the pawn .
move ic almost always unless you are avc doing an off opening .
castle always needs ic a castle .
it is ic important .
it is ic the key to protection .
look ic at the position before you move avc so you know avc what you can do nom and what your opponent can do nom .
that is ic about it .
okay .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
it depends ic on who you play nom .
some people play ic really slow .
and some people play ic fast .
but it usually takes ic from twenty minutes at the very least to maybe an hour and a half .
when you get avc a lot better , like a grand master , they take ic five hours a game .
what makes a game last a long time ?
well often when you move avc slowly , obviously , and if you trade avc off a lot of pieces before you can checkmate avc the king , so there is nom only like a king and a couple of pieces left , then there have obviously been ic more moves to take .
them so it is ic just the moves that that the longer the game will go nom .
so what makes a game end quickly ?
be short ?
if you have avc a really good tactic at the beginning or close to the beginning it will probably be ic a shorter game .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
yes .
can you tell me about it .
well you some games you will start ic with thirty minutes on each side .
some you will start ic with longer .
and after you move avc the piece you hit ic the clock .
and then the other person's time will start ic going down .
and then once they move avc then they will hit ic the clock .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess .
no .
i am going to ask you some general questions , okay ?
do you have any brothers or sister ?
only sisters .
only sisters .

not very much .
do you ever play chess on a computer ?
no .
now will you tell me why you enjoy chess .
i do not know ic why .
i just do ic .
well , i'm not too familiar with the game of chess .
and you probably know a lot more about it than i do .
so i'd like you to explain some things to me if that's okay .
first of all , how many people may play a game of chess at one time ?
four .
four ?
i've heard of simultaneous matches .
do you know what those are ?
no .
will you tell me about the different pieces and how they're supposed to move ?
well , the king can only move once at a time .
but he can only move anywhere around him as long as it doesn't put you in check .
okay .
what's check ?
check is when one piece is threatening the king .
can you tell me anything about the other pieces and how they move ?
the queen is like the king except she can move as many times as she wants .
like across the board .
okay .
like right across the board .
and there's bishops .
they can only go diagonal same as the same distance as queens .
the horse and the horses they have to go in an l shape .
they can only but they are the only pieces that can jump over other pieces .
the horses ?
, but that doesn't mean like that when that the player attacking you can jump over it .
okay , he can't do that .
that would be considered as cheating .
will you tell me about the goals of chess , in other words , what the players are trying to do ?
get the king in check .
in check ?
checkmate , actually .
okay .
now tell me the rules the players need to follow .
in other words , tell me everything you can think of about the game of chess so that someone who has never played before would know how to play .
well i left off the pawns and bishops when i was telling you about how they can move .
the bishops can are like queens .
except they can only go side to side or up and down .
and the pawns can only go straight forward .
or if they are attacking , they can go diagonally , one space though .
okay .
are there any other rules you can think of that you want to tell me about ?
well , checkmate is when the king's threat is just check except the king can't move anywhere .
and when your king's in check , you can't move anymore .
okay .
well , you can move somewhere .
but you have to move somewhere where you're not in check .
okay .
and it's illegal to move into check .
and i don't think i can think of any more .
but i know there's a move called a pawn lover which is two pawns diagonally or more pawns diagonally which means which .
which the only way to break a pawn lover is to take a piece that can go diagonal and take the first one out and keep going until there's no more or until there's only one .
okay .
now i'd like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win a game of chess .
in other words , what are some key strategies that every good player should know ?
well , there is this one strategy i like to use a lot .
well , it's a move actually .
and it's a pretty powerful move because you almost have right in front of your pieces is protected every place .
and it's set up like two the two pawns in front of the queen and king go up to the knight .
the two bishops go diagonal to the sides of the pawns .
and the knights go below the bishops .
and the then the two pawns in front of the knights go up one so they're next to the the knights .
, okay .
i like to use that a lot .
do you know of any other strategies or ways to win the game ?
well , you can make a wall with your pawns since they're up front in front of all the other pieces , as a defense move , and keep on moving up but only one at a time .
okay .
anything else you can think of ?
well , there is one old fashioned way to win which is either a queen or rook or rooks that you can .
that means you check but the other piece right on the square diagonal from it .
so so the king has to go downward .
and you keep on doing that until the king can't move any more .
and that's checkmate .
, okay .
and also there's this one thing i was going to talk about .
but i forgot what it was .
if you remember it later , you can tell me .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
i don't know .
it depends on how good the player is .
take my sister for instance .
it usually takes about a couple of minutes to beat her .
but it's harder when you're good at it .
it should take at least an hour if both players are good players .
what makes a game last a long time ?
making good moves when your opponent is making some other good moves .
what makes a game move quickly ?
when you one of the players do good moves and the other does bad moves .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
when you move a piece , tap the button on your side .
and it keeps on going .
but when you're using clocks , when yours is on the twelve , your enemy can flag you which means you automatically lose .
really ?
yes .
when does that happen ?
when both the big hand i think is on the twelve .
i don't remember because i don't usually play with that .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess ?
i don't think so .
you can tell me anything you want to about it .
i can't think of anything .
that's okay .
well thank you again for talking with me .

there is ic also topalov which was , which was the which was rc the world champion for a small amount of time .
then he lost ic .
and so he is ic no longer the world champion .
bobby fischer , he is not playing ic chess anymore because he broke avc the rules during one of the wars and playing in a chess tournament he was not rc supposed to play in in russia .
and now he has escaped ic to iceland .
and he is kind of in hiding ic .
there is ic several other players .
there is ic kasparov , garry kasparov .
he was ic world champion for a long time .
and then he retired ic because he is getting avc older and stuff .
i can name ic lots of them .
you know lots of them .
do you ever play chess on the computer ?
yes , but my chess doctor program broke down ic .
i used to play ic chess master which is a game rc .
chess master nine thousand .
but it kind of broke ic and is not working quite well .
i hope ic to get chess master ten thousand .
i have also got ic a new game .
but i have not really installed ic it yet because you need avc a password .
my friend gave ic me the game .
but i do not know ic the password to set it up .
that's always a bit of a challenge .
now tell me why you enjoy chess .
i like ic chess because well it is avc kind of competitive .
and for me , well i like ic competitive things .
chess is i also like ic chess because its well its i kind of feel avc like when i'm thinking avc about a move , it is nom kind of like i am analyzing nom the position where i am thinking nom , well , what should i do nom ?
it is ic kind of fun to problem solve like that , to use critical thinking skills .
to and if you we are expected ic to record our games and and use algebraic knight to queen four stuff .
and that puts ic a lot of chess players ahead in middle school because they are avc already doing that .
i also like ic just playing for fun .
okay , i'm not nearly as familiar with the game of chess as you are , so i'm going to have you explain some things to me .
first of all , how many people can play a game of chess at one time ?
it kind of depends ic what game of chess you are playing nom if if like it is avc just a regular tournament game like the player with the white pieces verses the player with the black pieces .
there is ic also a fun game we sometimes play rc called bughouse which two players face nom versus two players and there is nom two boards .
so these two players are ic on a team .
and these two players are ic on a team .
and they play ic each other .
this player passes ic from his opponent , passes to his teammate .
and it is ic kind of instant death .
the first person to lose their team loses ic .
you can play ic different versions of that .
but i forgot ic the name for it .
it is ic another version of it where there is nom three versus three and there is nom like a commander or whatever in the center .
i forgot ic what the name of it was nom though .
sounds pretty intense .
so these players pass ic their pieces to the center player .
and the center player passes ic his piece to whoever he thinks nom needs it most in their positions .
that gets ic pretty complicated .
i bet .
i've also heard of simultaneous matches .
what is that ?
it is ic where one person can simul nom a whole bunch of people .
a whole bunch of people will be sitting ic at their own chess board .
each person will be ic in a line .
and one person might be standing ic up .
and he will play ic one board and then walk around to another board .
or two people may be simuling ic a whole bunch of people or five people .
so lots of people can play ic chess .
i do not know ic if there is nom even a limit .
it is ic difficult for the simuler .
but usually the player who simuls rc is ic much more experienced .
like the chess coach might be doing ic a simul with all of his students .
can you tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move ?
there are the the first and most important piece in the game is ic the king .
and the king if you are it kind of depends ic what game of chess you are playing nom .
sometimes you are playing ic a game with a chess clock .
and that is ic when you hit nom the clock .
and the time starts ticking ic down from like five minutes or four minutes .
and the time keeps ticking ic down .
and so , so and then when you are playing avc what is called nom blitz or five minute chess there is ic a rule called capture the king .
and that is ic when you do not have nom to say check .
instead of saying check and moving the king somewhere , you just keep ic it quiet .
and when you capture avc the king you win ic the game .
that game the king is ic also the most important .
you do not want ic to lose your king .
but in regular chess , which is more commonly played rc , the king can not be captured ic .
they might say ic check .
it is ic against the rules to leave your king in check .
you must move ic your king to unless it is avc impossible to do so without being captured .
and then that is ic a checkmate .
and you lose ic the game .
and so the king is ic the most important piece .
but there is ic a downfall to the king because the king can not move avc very easily because it can only move avc one space .
it can move ic diagonal or forward backward sideways etcetera .
except it can not go ic off the board .
no pieces can go ic off the board .
it can move ic any direction only one square in that direction it's not very .
then there is ic the queen , which is rc an extremely valuable piece .
and and sometimes when you use avc points to describe the pieces the queen is worth ic nine points .
but the queen is worth ic nine points .
the queen it is ic not really wise to get your queen out early because if it is captured avc right away you lose nom tempo .
and so the queen can move ic very similarly to the king .
it can move ic forward , diagonally , sideways , backwards , as long as it does not move avc off the board .
except it can move ic as many squares in that direction as it wants avc .
as long it can be ic on this side of the board and go straight across to that side of the board as long as there are nom no pieces in the way .
if your knight is blocking avc it or one of your other pieces is blocking avc it , you can not jump ic over them .
it has been ic blocked .
but you can capture ic the piece that is blocking rc .
so the queen is ic very mobile and extremely useful .
then there is ic the rook .
there is ic only one king and queen in the game .
but the rooks , some people call them castles rc , you get ic two of those .
and two rooks is ic extremely useful near the end of the game because you can use avc them to force the king in .
one rook is worth ic five points .
so if you have avc two rooks together , it is worth ic ten points .
more than nine points , so you would rather have ic two rooks than one queen .
and rooks are ic very very mobile but not as mobile as the queen because they can not go avc diagonally .
they can go ic forwards , sideways , backwards left right etcetera as long as they do not go nom off the board .
that is ic the rooks .
they start ic in the corner of the board .
so it takes ic a while until they finally get avc into the game .
at the beginning of the game they are ic not very active .
next is ic the bishops .
the bishops and the knights are both worth ic three points .
the bishops and the knights are ic completely different pieces .
it kind of depends ic what the position is nom .
if the position is avc really open with a lot of open space , bishops are ic much more slightly more valuable because they can go avc anywhere on the diagonal .
they can not go ic side to side .
they can only capture ic on the diagonal .
and so they are ic good in open games .
but sometimes it might be ic really jammed .
and the pawns are ic everywhere .
and the pawns it is ic kind of hard to move around with the bishop .
then knights are ic more valuable because they are avc the only piece that can jump rc a piece .
but knights are ic kind of complicated when you are avc first starting because they do not go avc in a straight direction like the other pieces .
they jump ic .
and what they do is ic they go nom two steps either forward or to the left or to the right any of those ways and then one step another way and those ways and not three steps back but two steps back and one to the left or to the right .
there are ic lots of possibilities .
and you can jump ic pieces .
you capture ic by landing on the piece same as the other pieces .
by landing on a piece , you capture ic the piece .
the knights kind of make ic an l shape .
and so it is ic two in one direction and then one in another direction .
they are ic very useful in close games because they can be avc really mobile .
in the end game , they slowly become ic less useful because if they are trying avc to stop a piece it takes avc a while to get to the end of the board because they can not go avc straight there .
then there is ic one last piece , the pawn , which is rc actually the most complicated piece because it has avc lots of rules that come rc with it .
generally pawns only move ic one space forward .
they can not go ic backwards .
they can not go ic to either side .
but they are ic different than other pieces because they do not capture avc by landing forward .
they capture ic pieces diagonally in front of them .
it can not be ic diagonally behind .
if there is avc a piece that is rc just one square diagonal from them in front of them in the direction they are going rc , they can take ic it by going diagonal .
and however if they are avc on the starting line , the second line , if the pawn is avc still on its first line , it can move ic two squares forward instead of only one square forward .
and that is ic the only time it is allowed nom to do that .
if by any chance a piece is avc in its way , it can not move ic .
it is ic just kind of stuck there .
but there is ic a good thing about pawns .
if they get avc to the very last file in the direction they are going rc then they promote ic .
and a promotion happens ic on the last file .
and they can choose ic any piece they want rc to turn into .
except they can not become ic a pawn .
they can not become ic a king .
but you can choose ic to turn into a knight , a bishop , a queen , a rook .
most people choose ic queens or rooks .
sometimes a knight might be ic better .
you never know ic .
pushing a pawn to the last file and choosing a knight might put ic a check on the king or checkmate him .
pawns move ic like that .
their starting value is ic one point .
that is ic what people say nom .
but i think ic they get nom more valuable the farther they are rc because if it is avc really close to the end of the board it gets nom more valuable because all the time it can turn avc into a more valuable piece .
pawns have ic kind of an indefinite value .
what are the goals of chess ?
what are the players trying to do ?
the players are trying ic to do the best they can .
so like in a tournament generally you are going ic for a win .
but you might only have ic a king left .
and your opponent has ic a king and a pawn .
there is ic no way you can win rc with just a king because you do not have avc any material to capture the king .
in that position you can not really go ic for a win .
but you want ic to do your best because you might be able avc to force a draw .
if your king captures avc their pawn then you each have ic a king and it forces nom a draw .
so in those cases your goal is ic a draw .
but generally you go ic for a win .
you go ic for the best you can do rc .
goals in chess some goals might be ic “by the end of this summer i want nom a rating of over one thousand” or whatever .
your goal might be ic to push your rating to be a certifier in tournament that you are having rc trouble beating or just improve your chess .
many people have ic different goals .
my goal is ic to try to get my rating over one thousand .
sounds like you're on your way .
i am ic pretty close .
so , i'm someone who has never played a game of chess in my life .
and so what do i need to know so i could sit down and play a game of chess ?
you need ic to know how the pieces move nom .
and i already explained ic all that .
first of all if you are first starting avc most players need to know ic that you need nom to show courtesy .
like we are asked ic to shake hands and say good luck before each tournament game .
and you so you need to know you need to be ic courteous and at the end of the game say good job and not be like ha , i won nom or boohoo , i lost nom .
but it is ic not about winning or losing .
it is ic about playing chess .
so they have to know they have to be ic courteous .
and that is ic kind of a rule .
and if you are avc not , you can get kicked ic off the tournament .
you are ic not allowed to make comments about a game in progress .
they need ic to know that you can not move nom your king into any square that a piece is already controlling rc .
if like a rook is avc here and it is avc controlling this whole file , i can not move ic my king there because he would be avc in check .
and in most tournament games , it is ic good courtesy to say check when you move avc your opponent into check .
you gotta remember ic like if they have avc a rook here and your king is avc here and you have got avc a bishop in the way , you can not move nom the bishop out of the way because your king would be avc in check .
that means ic the bishop is pinned nom to the king .
there are ic some other rules .
and you have ic to follow those rules .
like you can not move ic twice in a row .
and you can not make ic comments about someone else's game .
you you can't well that is ic most of the rules .
there has ic got to be something else .
that is ic basically it .
you just need ic to know how the pieces work nom and when a checkmate happens nom .
and there is ic one other term used .
it is ic called a stalemate .
and that is ic when none of the pieces can move nom .
but the king is ic not currently in check .
that is called ic a stalemate .
the game is ic over .
and it is ic a draw .
it means ic they both tie nom .
each player got ic half a point .
i highly recommend ic that you record nom your games .
it is not required ic at every tournament .
they do not force ic you to .
but i highly recommend ic it just because it kind of helps avc you think nom .
it slows ic down your game a bit .
you are not moving ic as fast .
so you have ic more time to think when you are writing avc it down .
just writing it down gives ic you more time to reflect instead of just moving the pieces .
and in some tournaments , not all tournaments do nom it , but some tournament directors use ic the touch move rule and the release move rule .
the release move rule is ic if you move avc your piece and let it go then your turn is nom permanent and you can not change nom it .
the touch move rule is ic if you touch avc a piece , you have to move nom it .
i guess ic there are nom other clock rules .
but you don't usually play ic with a clock .
that is ic basically the rules .
once you're comfortable with the rules , what are some key strategies that every good player should know ?
you should know ic how to identify different openings and check your move for several things first .
is it ic legal ?
and if i move and before you even touch avc the piece you think ic about the move .
you identify in chess club you have ic to identify a few moves that might be rc possibilities and several steps .
like if i move avc there can they checkmate ic me ?
if i move avc there can they take ic me ?
and it might be ic okay if they take avc me because it might be avc a sacrifice or whatever .
but what is ic my reason for doing this ?
am i just moving ic it for the sake of moving it ?
if i move avc there what would they do ic next ?
would that be ic bad ?
you go through ic an analysis looking for several moves ahead .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
it kind of depends ic if you are using nom a clock .
like if it is avc one minute chess where each player has nom one minute on the clock it goes ic at a furiously moving pace .
they are literally analyzing ic ten moves ahead .
those games go ic extremely fast .
the games can be done ic in ten minutes or less .
some games take like grand masters have lasted ic over ten hours .
that is ic a really really long game .
it can take ic more than five minutes a move .
is that what makes it take so long ?
because they take ic an extremely long time on every single move .
they do ic a much more advanced analysis and such .
it is ic much more in depth .
world record games have gone ic on for multiple days .
your question was ic how long does nom it usually take ?
just on average .
if i am playing avc an opponent that is rc extremely difficult , like with a high rating .
do not judge ic a person by their rating cause you never know avc .
it could be ic an unrated player , that's rc never been rated , but is rc still extremely difficult .
so do not judge ic by the rating .
ratings are not ic always extremely accurate .
a person can be ic over rated or under rated .
when i am playing avc a person about my age i usually take ic about half an hour at least half an hour to finish the game .
it is ic pretty intense .
if i'm playing an sometimes i can win ic in under five minutes .
but that generally does not ic happen .
so for an average player a game probably lasts ic twenty minutes maybe .
so we talked about what makes a game last a long time .
if the players are avc extremely even , so with like really similar ratings , it can take ic a long time .
if one player is avc much better , well not really better but much more experienced than the other player , then they will probably finish ic much faster .
the longest games are played ic by two people that analyze rc their moves and who are rc at the same level of chess .
and what makes a game go faster ?
if a player i have seen ic games where one player is nom very advanced and one is nom just beginning .
so one player is ic taking time to think about their move while the other player is avc just moving .
if you are not thinking avc about your game as much , it goes ic faster or if you use avc tactics really early in the game like they accidentally leave nom their queen unguarded and you take nom their queen out .
as i said ic earlier , there is nom a point system .
so if you are avc really ahead in points so your position has ic a much higher value .
it is ic kind of like your army or troops are nom worth more .
materials is not ic always what wins nom the game .
but it makes ic the game go faster .
there are ic ways to checkmate in two to eight minutes .
it is ic possible .
if you checkmate avc in two moves , it is ic called fool's mate .
it only happens ic if your opponent makes nom those deliberate moves that cause him to lose rc the game in two moves .
usually opponents do not purposefully make ic those kinds of moves .
i know we talked about a chess clock for one minute moves , two minute moves .
what else is it used for ?
five minute moves , thirty minutes , fifteen minutes on each clock .
sometimes like a game might like have ic a schedule .
in the middle of a game if there is avc another game supposed rc to begin in half an hour they will ic put a clock like fifteen minutes a player .
sometimes kids might organize ic a blitz tournament around themselves where they just play nom blitz games and stuff .
and the clocks generally in a regular tournament they do not start ic you with a clock unless it is taking avc a long time .
then they will use ic a clock to control the time .
one minute moves might be ic bullet or thunder or lightning chess .
those are ic disasters .
you make ic massive blunders .
but the fortunate thing is ic your opponent does not have nom time to realize you are making blunders nom because they are making avc blunders because it is going avc so fast .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess ?
well , not really .
that is pretty much it ic .
i am ic a bit tired .
i have learned so much about chess today .
thank you !
before we talk about chess i want to learn something about you .
i am going to ask you a few questions , then you can ask me some questions too if you want .
do you have any brothers or sisters ?
just a sister .
how old is she ?
three .
can you tell me anything else about her ?
she plays ic princesses a lot .
she likes princesses ?
she watches ic cinderella all the time .
do you have any pets at home ?
no , but we are going to ic get one when my mom owns avc a house .
what are you going to get ?
probably another dalmatian .
a dalmatian was ic the first pet i ever got rc .
and there was ic a cat , then the turtle .
that is cool .
do you have a favorite tv show or a movie ?
actually i got ic a lot .
what is the favorite one you watch over and over .
actually all three .
what are they ?
and my favorite movie is ic my dog skip .
you like to read books or magazines .
, books a lot .
what kind of books ?
chapter books .
what are they about ?
do you want to ask me anything ?
no .
how long have you played chess ?
how old were you when you started ?
chess club or just playing chess ?
chess .
i have ic played for four years .
and how old were you when you first started ?
four .
four .
who taught you how to play chess ?
i forgot ic .
but i think ic my grandma .
do you have a chess rating ?
like a chess ladder ?
yes .
, in chess club .
and now i am ic around fifteen .
i won ic my last two games .
and if you beat avc that person , even if you are avc like number twenty and he is avc fifteen , you go straight ic to fifteen .
and he goes straight ic down to twenty .
do you have a coach or teacher ?
, i forgot ic his name .
wait , his name is ic jerry .
can you tell me a little about jerry ?
he teaches ic us ways to get out of stuff .
do you belong to a chess club ?
which one ?
the one in fox hollow .
how often do you play chess , say in a typical week ?
i do not know ic .
fifteen minutes or an hour .
i do not know ic .
you mean fifteen minutes everyday .
who do you play with the most ?
i think ic brent in the first round .
but but when jerry picks ic .
but i usually play ic brent first .
then if he picks avc me and brent , we start ic all over .
and we play ic again .
can you name any famous chess players ?
no , but i know ic that the fox hollow chess club beats nom some people in the football team .
it was ic the ducks .
do you ever play chess on a computer ?
not till i'm twenty one .
can you tell me about that ?
about playing on the computer ?
i played it ic a few times .
but i usually do not ic .
do you like playing ic on the computer .
, even though it is ic kind of hard .
now , can you tell me why you enjoy chess ?
because it is ic kind of hard .
and i really love ic playing it .
i am not too familiar with chess .
you probably know a lot more about it than i do .
so i would like you to explain some things to me .
first of all , how many people can play a game of chess at one time ?
two .
i have heard of simultaneous matches .
do you know what that is ?
tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move .
a king can only move ic one space .
he can go ic diagonal .
he can go ic forward , backwards , sideways and diagonal .
a bishop can only go ic diagonal but only on the color .
the rook can only go ic sideways and forward .
the pawns can only go ic forward unless they are trying avc to attack .
and then they go ic diagonal .
now tell me about the goal of chess .
in other word , what are the players trying to do .
get the king in check .
now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
in other words , tell me everything that you can think of about the game of chess .
if they let go avc of the piece after they move avc , they can not go ic back .
if they are playing avc touch move , if they touch avc it they have to move ic it .
it is ic where a pawn is nom sideways from you .
then you go ic diagonal .
but you are going ic to take it .
and then you get ic it .
now i would like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess .
in other words , what are some key strategies that every good player should know ?
at the end , if you only have avc a king , queen or two rooks , say you put avc a rook somewhere , then it will not be able ic to pass the rook .
like if it is avc on three , then the king will not be able ic to go anywhere .
then you move ic the rook .
you move ic another rook too .
if one rook is avc on three , so then the king would have to go ic back again .
and you keep doing ic that until he is avc in the corner .
so the king is ic stuck .
and you can not move ic until you win avc .
how long to they usually take to play a game of chess ?
if you are ic really good , like on the chess ladder , if you are avc number one , and they pair avc you with number twenty , not that long but just their regular game , a few minute .
what makes a game last a long time ?
sometimes you take ic your move back .
like you think ic you are going nom to do it .
and you do ic this .
and you put ic our finger on it like you are going nom to you take it off .
what make a game end quickly ?
if you have a lot of strategies ic .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
how do you use a chess clock ?
well , we have ic two kinds , a digital one and a segway .
you press ic a button that means rc the other person's turn .
then you then he moves ic a piece .
and you try ic to go really fast .
and you keep pressing ic it .
then on the regular one there the there is ic this red thing .
and if the red thing drops avc , you can call ic for a flag .
and then you automatically win ic .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess ?
i do not know ic .
thanks again for talking with me today .
so , before we talk about chess , i'd like to learn some things about you .
i am going to ask you a few general questions and than you can ask me some questions , too , okay ?
okay .
so , do you have any brothers or sisters ?
yes , i have ic one brother .
his name is ic owen .
how old is he ?
he is ic five and .
and what , go ahead .
he turned five ic in august last year .
what else can you tell me about him ?
he is ic really annoying sometimes .
that is ic most of it .
do you have any pets at home .
yes , we have ic two guinea pigs .
one is ic called marshmallow .
she is ic all white with red eyes .
and one is ic called smores .
and she is ic black , white and brown .
and we got ic them .
how we got nom them is ic we , at my school a classroom had nom them .
but they both had ic fungus .
so we took ic care of them .
and then the principal said ic that they could not take nom them back .
so we got ic them .
do you have a favorite tv show or movie ?
my favorite sh movie is ic the lord of the rings .
i really like ic that .
tell me about it .
what do you like about it ?
i think ic it is nom funny at some times .
and i like ic all the battling and stuff .
do you like to read books or magazines ?
sometimes .
it depends ic on the book .
which ones ?
right now i am reading ic battle of the books .
it is a it is ic like a club thing .
and then in february we battle ic other teams in knowledge and how and what we know nom about that book .
and so i am reading ic those .
neat .
do you want to ask me anything .
no .
no ?
okay .
so now i'd like to ask you some things about chess .
okay ?
so , how long have you played chess ?
i started ic playing chess when i was adv about five or six .
so the next question was how old were you when you first started to play ?
so you were about ?
five or seven or six .
who taught you how to play chess ?
my dad and i got ic a game for a computer .
and i listened ic to that for directions .
do you have a chess rating ?
i am ic pretty good at it .
from a scale from one to ten , i am ic about maybe like a seven or a six .
and do you have a chess coach or a teacher ?
not really , no .
do you belong to a chess club ?
no , i do not do ic chess clubs .
and how often do you play chess in a typical week ?
what would that mean ic ?
like , in a week , how many times would you play ?
it depends ic what i am doing nom on the week .
maybe once i will play ic like once .
or if it is adv not too busy i will play ic twice .
and who do you play with the most ?
i usually play ic with my grandpa , my dad , and on the internet game .
can you name any famous chess players ?
no , i can not think ic of any .
and you sort of answered this already , but do you ever play chess on the computer ?
so tell .
i have ic a lego game .
i am ic a big fan of legos .
and it tells ic you how to move and all that stuff .
neat .
and tell me why you enjoy chess .
i think ic it is nom a fun game .
i just like ic the pieces and how they move nom .
and it is ic not like checkers which is rel you can only move nom diagonal and stuff .
so , i'm not very familiar with the game of chess and i think you probably you know a lot more than i do .
so i'd like you to explain some things to me about how to play .
first of all , how many people , , may play a game of chess at one time .
two people .
and i've heard of something called simultaneous matches .
do you know what that is ?
nope .
so tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move .
the pawn can move , which is like rel the piece that you have rel the most , can move ic two spaces on the first move .
and it can attack ic diagonally .
it can not attack ic forward .
and the castle can only go it can do ic how many spaces you want rel .
but it can only go ic horizontally and diag horizontally and vertically .
the horses can jump ic .
they go ic up two and then diagonal .
and they can jump wherever they can jump ic over pieces .
the bishop can only go ic diagonally .
and the queen can go ic whatever type she wants rel to do .
she can go ic diagonally , vertically and horizontally .
and she can go ic backwards .
and the king can do ic that .
but he can only move ic one .
so , tell me about the goals of chess .
like , what are you , what are the players trying to do ?
they are mostly trying ic to destroy all the other players and then get a checkmate .
a checkmate is ic when the king , if he moves adv any spaces , your players or pieces will be able nom to attack him .
and then he's and then that person is ic done .
and now the i have ic my own thing that i try rel to do .
and i try ic to get the pawns to the other side of the field to their area , because to the other team's area because if you do adv that , you can change adv that pawn into anything you want rel except for a king .
so , tell me the rules that the players need to follow .
like , tell me , , everything you can think of , think of , about the game so that someone like me who's never played before would know how to play .
the first rule i would think rel is ic to know what the pieces do nom and how they can move nom .
second one is , pause seven seconds .
i am ic not sure what the second one would be nom , probably who goes nom first and who goes nom second .
and what the the third one would probably ic what the objectives are nom and how you do nom it .
so , i'd like you tell me about what a player should do in order to win the game of chess .
like , what are some strategies that every good player should know .
probably to get rid of all of their characters until they only have ic pawns because pawns don't are adv not as useful until they get adv to the other side of the board because then they can turn adv into anything they want rel to .
and you'd probably the first objective would probably be ic to get rid of the queen because she is adv the most , i'm not sure how to put it in words let us see most useful on their team .
then you would probably want ic to get rid of the horses , then the castles , then the bishops .
and then you would want ic to get rid of the pawns and then the king .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess .
it depends ic on the people .
like , if it was adv me and my brother it would probably take ic thirty minutes to forty five because he doesn't know adv how to play and he always wants adv to move the pieces where he wants nom to move them .
and if i play adv with my dad it would probably be ic twenty minutes to thirty minutes because both know adv how to play .
so what can make a game last a long time ?
if people just move ic around randomly and do not get the other team because , if they do adv that then they are going nom to be attacked .
but it is ic only one guy .
what , what makes a game end quickly or be really short ?
if a king the other , the opposite team moves ic the king into a really stupid place or they do adv a really bad thing that they did not want rel to do .
laughing do you know how to use a chess clock ?

now tell me why you enjoy chess .
cause it is ic fun .
like you get learn ic a lot .
you can ic calculate stuff .
it teaches ic you .
i'm not too familiar with the game of chess .
you probably know a lot more about it than i do .
so i'd like you to explain some things to me .
the king can ic only move one square in any direction even diagonally .
the pawn can ic move one square in up .
but it cannot ic move down or to the right or left or diagonally .
but if it starts avc out you can ic move it twice .
and then the knight can ic move it moves in an l shape like one , two , three , and then left or to the right .
and then the and then the bishop moves ic diagonally as many squares diagonally as it can avc .
and then the queen can ic move diagonally or to the left or to the right or up or down .
and then the rook can ic move up and down and left and right .
how many people can play a game of chess at one time ?
two people .
but there is ic this type of chess called nightmare chess where like five people can play nom .
i've heard of simultaneous matches .
do you know what that means ?
no .
can you tell me about the different pieces and how they're suppose to move .
pawn moves ic up one .
but if it starts ic up at two .
rook moves ic to the left and right and up an down .
and bishop moves ic diagonally .
and then the knight moves ic two up and then one to the left or to the right .
king moves ic anywhere but one square .
it can ic move up , down , diagonally , but only one square .
then pawns move ic one square .
now tell me about the goal of chess .
so in other words what are the players trying to do ?
the players are trying ic to checkmate the other person .
or in blitz they try ic and capture the king .
now tell me about the rules that the player needs to follow .
so in other words tell me everything you can think about the game of chess so someone who has never played before knows how to play .
can ic you repeat that again .
sure .
can you tell me the rules the player needs to follow ?
so tell me everything you can think about the game of chess so tha that know one who has ever played like me before would know how to play .
do not like move ic your king up to where it can nom get captured .
like you want ic to move your pawns first to make it so your pieces can ope get opened nom .
and the and do not like if you are avc like in the game of chess do you cannot ic like move your king up .
because if you move avc your king up you are going ic to get checkmated really soon .
the and you cannot move ic your king into check like if the queen is guarding avc one square .
and you cannot ic move the king to that square .
the you cannot ic move a piece in on to another one of your pieces .
you have ic to like go around the piece .
usually there is ic like this touch piece move , where if you touch avc the piece you have to move it nom .
and then there is ic like the drop piece move , where if you you can touch avc the piece you do not have to move it nom .
but if you drop avc the piece and you let go of it avc then you have ic to move it .
well then it is ic already moved .
and then i do ic not remember any other ones .
now i'd like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess .
in other words , what are some key strategies that every good chess play should know ?
move your pawns up first ic because if you you want avc to like control the center avc .
if you control the center avc you usually know ic pieces can get in like able to checkmate you .
and then after when you control the center avc you want ic to move the knights to guard your pawns , so that they cannot capture your center avc .
and you do not want avc to move your queen out first ic .
if you move avc your queen out first you are usually going to waste ic like a tempo .
in other words your going to waste a move ic .
and then your opponent can have ic the upper advantage .
and then you want ic to castle .
usually if your opponents threatening checkmate avc you do not want ic to castle on that side .
you would usually want ic to castle on the kings side and .
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
usually probably like thirty to thirty minutes to and hour .
what makes a game last a long time ?
usually it is ic the thinking .
like players have ic to like think on their move .
if they do avc not think long enough usually they will ic get checkmated pretty easy .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
yes .
what makes a game end quickly ?
when usually when you like if you move avc your queen out usually they will checkmate ic you because your queen is avc not guarding any of your kings squares well your king pawns to where they can checkmate nom you really easily .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess .
no i do not ic .
before we talk about chess , i'd like to learn something about you .
i am going to ask you a few general questions , then you can ask me some questions .
do you have any brothers or sisters ?
yes , i have ic two brothers .
what are their names ?
my older brother is named ic will .
and my younger brother is named ic sean .
how old are they ?
will is ic nineteen .
sean is ic nine .
what else can you tell me about them ?
well sean is ic hyperactive .
and will lives ic on his own now .
and he does not return ic calls very often .
do you have any pets at home ?
no .
do you have a favorite tv show or movie ?
no .
do you like to read books or magazines ?
yes .
which ones ?
not really any particular genre .
do you have like a favorite book that you are recently reading about or a magazine that you recently read ?
do you read chess magazines ?
no .
do you want to ask me anything ?
no thanks .
okay , now i would like to ask you about chess .
how long have you played chess ?
since i was ic six or seven years old .
my grandpa used ic to play .
and so whenever he was avc in eugene , we would play ic chess .
and how old were you when you first started playing ?
how old were you when you first started playing , when you first started ?
well i guess ic six or seven .
so you say your grandfather taught you to play chess ?
do you have another person that taught you ?
well , i went ic to a chess club at my school for awhile .
so the instructors there taught ic .
do you have a chess rating ?
i have not checked ic it in a long time .
i had ic one but no idea what it is nom .
do you have a chess coach or a teacher ?
not anymore but i did ic when i still went avc to the clubs at school .
could you tell me a little about your chess teacher you had before ?
well , he was ic really into showing a certain position that some grandmaster chess player had been rc in .
and we had ic to analyze what the best move would be nom , why that would be nom , play out , a bunch of possible paths the game could take rc .
did you learn a lot from that instruction ?
i think ic i did nom , .
do you use some of those techniques now in your own play ?
do you find yourself remembering .
i am ic not sure .
i probably do ic .
but i do not consciously take ic something from a lesson .
it's just the lesson becomes ic part of your collective chess knowledge .
do you belong to a chess club ?
not currently .
how often do you play chess , say in a typical week ?
well some weeks i will be ic playing two or three games a day with my younger brother .
and other weeks i will only play ic four or five games total .
usually if my little brother has avc a tournament coming up we'll play ic a lot , all the time to get him ready .
so your brother , does he play in more tournaments than you now ?
yes .
who do you play the most ?
probably my brother .
can you name any famous chess player ?
i remember one ic .
his first name was ic bobby .
i am not sure ic about his last name .
it might have been ic fischer .
do you remember anything else about him ?
no .
it's not a quiz .
do you ever play chess on a computer ?
i have ic , yes .
can you tell me anything about that ?
i've never done that before .
well , it is ic the same game as playing it on the board .
but it feels ic different because you can not see avc the person you are rc playing with .
and well , you are ic seeing the board top down .
so it really looks ic a lot different , looking at it from a different angle like that .
now tell me why you enjoy chess .
i don't really know ic .
i sort of like doing ic puzzles in general like the crossword or the sudoku in the paper .
so i guess ic my brain enjoys nom solving puzzles like that .
and chess is ic a big puzzle so .
i'm not to familiar with the rules of chess .
you probably know a lot more about chess than i do , that is for sure .
so i would like you to explain some things to me .
okay .
okay .
first of all , how many people may play a game of chess at one time ?
two .
i've heard of simultaneous matches .
do you know what that is ?
well , sometimes there will be ic multiple boards set up .
and there will be ic one person who is rc playing on every single board against a different opponent .
so there is one person playing multiple people ?
tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move .
well , there is ic the pawn which can rc only move forward one square at a time unless it is avc capturing a piece , in which case , it can take avc diagonally .
and if that manages to get avc down to the last row , on the other side of the board , then you can turn ic it into a queen .
they cannot ic really move around very much .
so they are ic not particularly great at attacking pieces .
but they can ic set up a wall or a barrier that affects rc how all the other pieces can move nom .
then there is ic the bishop who can rc move diagonally .
and because they can avc only move diagonally , they will only be ic on one color for the entire game .
so sometimes , near the end of the game , you will notice ic that people can put nom all their pieces on a certain color square .
and the bishop will be ic useless .
and then there is ic the knight , which moves rc in an shape , which is rc really good at forking pieces , like attacking two different pieces at the same time so that they have avc to lose one of them because its movement is avc so irregular nothing but another knight can nom really stop it .
then there is ic the rook which can rc move horizontally or vertically .
and they tend to be ic really useful because you can avc put a rook behind a pawn and march the pawn down the board to try to get a queen .
and the rook will be defending ic it the entire time .
then there is ic the queen itself which can rc move like a rook or a bishop which makes rc it incredibly powerful because it can avc go almost anywhere on the board .
and then there is ic the king who can rc move one square in any direction .
and if the king is being attacked avc by another piece and there is avc nowhere safe that the king can move rc then the game is ic over .
now tell me about the goals of chess .
in other words , what are the players trying to do ?
when you are avc playing chess , you are ic trying to capture your opponent's pieces .
and often a way to do this is ic to gradually push them back across the board with an advancing wall of pawns or other pieces , to sort of trap them into a smaller space and to gradually pick off all the outlying pieces until eventually the king is avc trapped .
now tell me the rules that players need to know .
in other words , tell me everything you can think of about the game of chess so that someone who has never played before would be able to play .
well , when one piece is avc attacking the king , the person who is rc attacking says ic check .
and then the person who is rc being attacked has ic to either capture the attacking piece , move the king out of the way , or put another piece in the way , to get themselves out of check .
and you are ic not allowed to do any move that would put rc you in check .
on a pawn's very first turn it can move ic two squares instead of one if you wanted avc to .
if you have avc a king and a rook and both of them are avc in the same position as the start of the game , then you can have ic the king move two squares toward the rook and the rook jump over it .
that is ic called castling .
and it is ic usually something that people try rc to do because it gets avc the king out of the middle of the board , which is rc very open and dangerous , over to the side of the board where things are rc more safe .
i think ic that is nom mostmostly all all of the rules .
okay .
now i'd like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess ?
in other words , what are some key strategies that every good player should know ?
well , you want ic to get on top of your opponent .
you cannot spend ic turns doing moves that are rc not really productive or doing moves that you will rc later have to take back .
because if you do avc that , then they begin ic to get the advantage .
they are ic the person with the initiative .
and you end up ic just trying to keep them away from you .
and when you are avc moving these your pieces , and trying to stay on top of them , you have ic to make sure no piece is left undefended nom to keep it from being taken .
you have ic your pieces work in tandem with each other because when you have avc two or three pieces all attacking the same area , then it is nom very easy for them to sweep in and do a lot of damage .
whereas , a piece working on its own , will not get ic very far before being captured .
you will often want ic to sort of trick your opponent with moves they would not see coming rc like forking two important pieces or putting the king in check to drive them away from something that needed to be protected rc so you could get avc in easier .
and i have noticed ic that usually the person who is rc the most aggressive , as long as they are avc not so aggressive that they make rc foolish moves , is nom the person who wins rc in the long run .
so it is better to be on the offense , you're saying .
because when you are avc on the defense , you are ic trying to stop them from doing damage to you .
whereas , when you are avc on the offense , you are ic trying to do damage to them .
is that the way you usually play ?
how long does it take to usually play a game of chess ?
well , that would depend ic on who you are playing nom against .
if you are just playing avc a casual game , people tend ic to not put a lot of thought into their moves .
they go ic pretty quickly .
and the game can be ic over in five to ten minutes .
on the other hand , if you are avc playing a serious game against a serious opponent and you are avc really taking the time to think about your moves , it could take ic half an hour to an hour .
what makes a game last a long time ?
the game generally lasts ic a long time if the two players are avc evenly matched .
because if one player has a huge skill is avc much more skilled than the other player then they will be ic able to beat their opponent pretty quickly .
but when they are avc evenly matched , they will spend ic their time looking for ways to get the upper hand .
being evenly matched , neither one is ic able too .
so they spend ic a lot of time in a dead lock with not a lot of really dynamic moves being done .
what makes a game end quickly ?
a game ends ic quickly when someone is avc either not very skilled or makes a large mistake because they end avc up falling very far behind very quickly and because they are avc so far behind and have much less pieces , the other person is nom able to easily wipe them out simply by sheer numbers .
and also , if someone is avc playing against a friend , the atmosphere is ic much more casual than serious .
and the games generally go ic very quick .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
yes .
can you tell me about it ?
well , a chess clock is ic two clocks in one .
and whoever's turn it is rc their clock will be ic ticking .
it will count ic down from a time that was rc determined before the game , maybe an hour in tournaments on average .
and whenever the person makes avc their move , they will ic then press a button then which will cause rc their clock to stop and the other person's clock to start ticking .
and if people are avc taking too long on their moves , then by the end of the game their timer will have ic run out at which point they lose nom the game .
is there anything else you want to tell me about chess ?
what do ic you mean by that ?
well , is there anything that i didn't ask you , that you'd like to tell me about about chess that i didn't ask you about .
nothing is ic coming to mind .
okay , well , thanks for coming today .
you have been very helpful .
before we start talking about chess , i'd like to ask something about you .
i'm going to ask you a few general kinds of questions .
and then you can ask me some questions too at the end if you want , okay ?
okay .

i've seen that too .
do you like to read books and magazines ?

then i kind of got ic bored of it .

, a little bit .
, i thought that they did get longer at that point .
do you want to ask me anything ?
no , not really .
okay .
you could if you want .
and you can ask me anytime , if you change your mind .
and now i'm going to ask you about chess .
how long have you played chess ?
about a year .
okay .
and how old were you then when you first started to play ?
ten .
who taught you how ?
well , my dad kind of got ic me into it .
and then my teacher started ic just teaching .
well , my chess teacher .
do you have a chess rating ?
not really .
so you have a chess coach or teacher ?
tell me about him or her .
he is ic pretty nice .
and he's well he just teaches ic me a lot .
and it makes ic it easy .
so .
makes you understand it better ?
do you belong to a chess club too ?
not really .
how often do you play chess , say , in a week ?
right now i am playing ic two times a week .
and who do you play with the most ?
i play with we go ic to the veterans building .
and there are ic just a bunch of kids in the class .
is it your own class that goes , or your chess group ?
or is it just anybody who shows up ?
, it is ic just the chess group .
okay .
can you name any famous chess players ?
not really .
okay .
you just like the game .
have you ever played chess on a computer ?
once .
what was that like ?
i did not like ic it because it was avc too hard .
, the computer was too smart , outsmarted you ?
now , why do you like it ?
what makes it good for you ?
why did you choose it ?
well , it is ic a good thinking game .
and it is nom just a hobby , i guess ic .
you know ic ?
is it challenging ?
i cannot really beat ic some of the people there , or most of them .
so .
are they older , or younger ?
about my age .
have they been playing longer ?
now , i'm not really familiar , you can probably tell , with the game of chess .
you've been playing for one year .
and you probably know a lot more about it than i do .
so i'd like you to explain some things to me , as if you were telling me about it .
okay .
so first of all , how many people can play a game at one time ?
well , , well there's what's called , i cannot remember ic the name of it .
but one person plays ic multiple people .
i think ic the record is nom one against sixty five .
so .
but usually a game is ic just one on one .
okay .
is that what would be called a simultaneous match ?
is that it ?
okay .
and how do you do that ?
i can understand playing one on one .
but how would you do that with so many people ?
what happens ?
well , my teacher , jerry , he always sets ic up end games for us .
and we just make ic a little circle of desks and put chess boards on .
and he just comes ic around by us one by one .
we make ic a move .
then he makes ic a move .
then he moves ic on to the next person .
and what's an end game ?
an end game is ic where there is nom not very many people , i mean , pieces on the board .
and .
so it's as if you were getting toward the end of the game .
tell me about the different pieces .
you mentioned the pieces .
and i know they all have great shapes , and different names , and how they move .
tell me about that .
the pawn is ic the pieces that are rc on the front .
and they are ic almost useless .
but they rate ic pieces by their pawn worth .
so pawns are worth one pawn is nom worth nine pawns because they can turn avc into a queen , i believe ic .
and a king is ic the piece that if your king dies avc then you automatically lose nom the game .
so he is ic probably the most worthless piece because he cannot move avc very well .
but if he dies avc you lose ic .
so .
and then your queen is ic the most the best piece on the board because it can move avc almost anywhere .
and knights are ic little horses .
and they move ic in l shapes .
rooks can only move ic straight in straight lines , side to side and up and down .
and bishops can only move ic diagonally .
those are ic all the pieces .
i've also heard of castles .
what are they ?
how it is avc set up on the back rank behind the pawns , on the king's side , next to the king is ic a bishop , then a knight , and then a rook which is are rc the shapes of castles .
then when that knight and rook are avc out of the way , the king and the rook kind of switch ic places .
so it is ic protecting the king .
now , what exactly is the goal of chess ?
what are you trying to do when you're playing ?
well , it matters ic what kind of game you are nom playing .
there are ic two games .
there is ic blackout and just regular chess .
can you explain those to me ?
blackout is ic where if the person all the pieces on the board of one side gets avc taken off they lose nom .
but regular chess is ic where if you play nom to take out their king and just to gain other pieces to take their pieces away .
when would you play blackout ?
just when you want ic to have fun and stuff .
okay .
what are the rules that players follow ?
tell me everything you can think about , about chess .
if i wanted to sit down and play , how would you tell me what i have to do ?
well , , the when the king is in danger by another piece .
how do you start ?
start from the beginning .
okay .
it starts ic where white moves nom first .
and usually they have ic to move their their pawn .
how do i set up my pieces ?
there are ic eight pawns in the second row .
and in the back rank there is ic a queen , a king , and then two bishops , two knights and two rooks .
and usually at the start there is ic a king pawn and queen pawn , the pawn in front of them .
usually people move ic their queen pawn first .
why ?
i do not know ic .
it is ic just that is how they do nom it .
and then there are ic different starting moves .
like someone could move ic their pawn to move their pawn .
but then black could move ic .
well , pawns attack ic diagonally one space .
they cannot attack ic forward .
okay .
but they move forward ?
but black will usu sometimes go ic right next to the other pawn where it can attack avc .
and the intention is ic to attack .
so .
i didn't i cannot really understand ic that yet .
but that is ic just some of the one of the moves that they make rc .
for opening ?
and later in middle games is ic where you want nom to start getting the king into check .
the other king .
check is ic where when the king is nom in danger .
like let us say ic the the king is nom over here and they move nom a rook over here so it can attack avc the next turn .
in a straight line , because they go in a straight line .
so the king is ic what's in called check .
so you either have ic to defend the king from the rook , take , destroy the rook , or move the king .
and then or there is ic checkmate , where no matter what they do avc the king is nom gone .
and that's the end of the game .
so .
and that's what you're aiming for .
and i usually play ic blitz .
it is ic where you have nom a time .
each player has ic five minutes .
and they have ic a little clock .
and then when it's you are done avc with your turn , you press ic a button .
and your clock stops ic .
and theirs start ic .
so in blitz it is ic called capture the king rule , where if their king is avc in check you do not have nom to tell them .
or otherwise you do ic .
and then if they do not see avc it , then you win ic .
or in blitz , if their time runs avc out , then you win ic .
and then end games is ic usually where it is nom a king versus a king versus a rook and a rook .
so one side has ic two rooks and a king .
and the other side just has ic a king and a bishop .
so that is ic what end games are nom .
and you want ic to use checkmate with your rooks .
you told me a little bit about this .
but maybe you can tell me some more .
what do you do in order to win the game ?
what are some of the strategies ?
you mentioned that a little bit before .
what are some the strategies in end games ?
what would you do if you have a king and two rooks ?
and the other guy has a king and a bishop ?
how would you make them move to make it checkmate ?
well , what you want you do not need ic your king at all .
you just need ic those two rooks .
and what you would do is first you would get ic your both of your rooks at one side at each side of the board .
and then you would move ic the king just right in front of the other king , where he cannot move nom at all .
and then they move ic somewhere .
and then you move ic another rook .
so it is ic in check .
but they are not touching ic each other if they move avc straight .
and then you kept ic on doing the same thing .
and it is ic called a rook storm .
and it usually ends ic up in checkmate unless the other person outsmarts avc them .
how would that happen ?
like let us say ic the king is nom right here .
and the rook it cannot attack ic diagonally .
but the king was ic in diagonal position to it .
and the rook and they did not know ic what to do like that .
but then they could just take ic it .
and you are ic free pretty much .
what happens with the other guy's bishop ?
i mean , isn't he trying to do the same thing to you ?
well , he cannot do ic it with one bishop .
but it is ic pretty hard .
i tried ic it .
and you want to you need ic two bishops to get to get it .
but it is ic pretty unlikely .
so .
any other kinds of strategies like that ?
that sounds pretty cool .
there are ic a lot .
but i cannot think ic of them off the top of my head .
how long does it usually take to play a game ?
if you don't do blitz or just end games , how long would it take ?
well , it matters ic if the how the player plays nom .
if he is already has avc a plan in his head before he plays avc , then it can go ic kind of fast , like ten minutes .
but if both the players are just thinking avc after moves slowly , it could take ic up to thirty maybe .
does it ever take longer than that ?
i've heard of games sometimes where they've taken days .
is that possible ?
how would that happen ?
our teacher saw ic a game that lasted rc six days .
so .
how could that be ?
well , they can leave ic the game and put a note on whose turn it is rc .
then they come ic back and go to the bathroom or get something to eat .
and then they just kept ic on playing .
but if you could do it in ten or thirty minutes , what does it take to make it go for six days ?
well , both the players have ic to be really good .
and they have to be they are both trying ic to outsmart the other person .
and by that you need ic to kind of double outsmart them .
so .
that is ic pretty hard if they are avc a pretty good player .
i know you just sort of mentioned this .
do you know how to use a chess clock ?
it is ic just a small rectangle thing where there are rc two screens , one for each player , and one button on top of each screen .
and then it starts ic out with five minutes on each .
and usually , well white has ic to go first .
so black presses ic their button .
and then it a red light goes ic up on the other side and then so indicating that it is nom their turn .
so then when they are avc done with their turn , they click ic on the button .
and it keeps ic going like that .
and if you run out of time ?
if you run avc out of time it is ic called a flag .
and you automatically lose ic .
i actually skipped one question here .
we talked about what makes a game last a long time .
but what could make it end really quickly ?
if they miss their clock avc , that would be ic one way .
does that happen a lot ?
, once for me .
and it goes ic really fast if i play avc our the best kid in our class .
then it could probably go ic really fast .
like he would beat ic me in five or six moves .
how does your teacher do ?
does he have a ranking ?
he is ic pretty good .
but i do not know ic his rating .
what else can you tell me about chess ?
what else ?
that is ic hard .
how do you get better ?
you get ic better just by learning new techniques and things , and play more and practice .
like right now my goal is ic to try to beat my dad .
and i just have ic to keep on practicing to beat him .
so far , i have not beat ic him yet .
but almost .
do you play with any of your , do you play with your sister or your mom ?
i taught ic my mom how to play .
i think ic thursday it was nom .
how'd she do ?

so there's a lot going in this picture .
so i just want you to tell me what you see in the picture .
and maybe like a creative story of what's going on .
or like how it's happening .
well it looks like a boy and a lion on a boat .
and a new place .
and a pond .
with lily pads .
and flowers .
and the outdoors .
with fish swimming around .
and both are interested in what's happening .
that's all .

you think the boy tamed it ?
where do you think they're going ?
to the bb little boy's home .
okay .
anything else ?
no .
not really .
move onto the next one .
same thing .
it's a little boy using his imagination as him in in a plane .
in the sky .
in his bedroom .
with clouds .
and he's in a costume .
with paper airplanes .
and he's on his bed with pillows directing .
do you think he's imagining it ?

what do you want to be when you grow up ?
a scientist .
a scientist ?
you're being a scientist right now .

speaking of scientists .
what's going on here ?
looks like she's experimenting that giant octopus .
and seeing how it reacts .
and what it does .
in the science lab .
and the octopus is doing research ?
wait what ?
the octopus is doing research with her in the science lab .
experimenting .
trying to figure out what chemicals go together .
there's just a lot going on .
i know .
anything else you notice ?
any other animals in there maybe ?
two rats .
so you think she's researching the octopus ?
or is the octopus helping her with something ?
the octopus is helping her .
although octopuses are smart .
anything else ?
alright .
last one .
looks like a fable .
where a girl is picking giant yaks .
out the ground .
or onions .
and .
maybe it's her first time getting it .
so she's probably going to show it to her parents .
and there are snails and stuff .
with more of these onions .
and she's picking them out in the outdoors .
she probably lives on a farm .
that's all .
how do you think it got so big ?
how do you think it got so big ?
maybe she probably planted many seeds in one area .
and it grew one really big one .
anything else ?
alright .
perfect .
moving onto the next one .
so go ahead and hit a buzzer .
i'm just going to .
you can hit one .

right ?
but you did a great job .
alright so go ahead and hit another buzzer for me and we can move on to the next one .
alright so the next one jibo is going to show you a bunch of pictures okay ?
and i want you to tell me everything you see in that picture and then maybe come up with a story about that picture and you can be as creative as you want okay you can literally make up anything you want so .
let me move jibo closer .
there we go .
a see a lion, a boy, water, fish, couple flowers, dragon fly i think, so maybe lily pads ?
a boat and some leaves .
pretty much all i can like see .
other than water and stuff like water and it's all i can see .
what do you think is going on in this picture if you had to come up with a story for it ?
there's a boy that became friends with a lion and took him on a trip and found fish and then the lion tried to eat the fish and the boy told the lion not to eat the fish and then the fish like followed them and also gave the fish flower .
so how did they become friends ?
so the boy was out canoing and the lion kuhcame and like started talking to the boy .
the lion didn't eat the boy ?
what ?
the lion didn't try to eat the boy ?
well he no .
no ?
no he's a nice lion .
he's a vegetarian .
he's a vegetarian .
anything you want to tell me about the picture or the story ?
there's also like like a dragon fly .
the boy saw a dragon fly and tried to catch it but it was really hard to catch .
alright .
that's a good story .
alright well jibo can you show us the next picture then ?
i see a bed, a boy, paper airplane, clouds, a drawer of toys, a wiwindow, a bunch of socks and clothes, but messy room .
messy room .
a picture and i think like an airplane or something ?
and maybe like wind marks like something like that and like beds like beds like a bed like bed sheeting and stuff .
did i say the boy already ?
yes .
and that's like all i see basically .
i don't see anything really else except there is a tree out the window .
some clouds out the window .
so what's going on in this picture, what's the story behind it ?
the boy's dad became an pilot and then he decided he wanted to be a pilot and he started flying around his toy plane in his room and then making paper airplanes that were also flying around and one got stuck in the tree .
and the cars down below, he acted like they were like the little cars from like when you're in an airplane the cars are super tiny .
and like he's also on the bed so it looks like the planes are higher up .
what do you say about the ceiling ?
the ceiling he's probably imagining it's like the sky .
because i see clouds .
maybe wind i don't know if that's wind or not but .
so he's imagining it, he doesn't actually not have a ceiling ?
okay makes sense .
alright anything else you want to tell me about this picture ?
alright we can move on to the next one .
jibo can you please show us the next picture ?
this one's one of my favorites .
i see some like bee well like science stuff .
a beaker, a lightbulb, a squid i think .
few posters, a lightbulb, a like boy that looks like a scientist, see rat, see a table and books, i see a magnifying glass that the squid is holding .
i see like posters that i think are like science posters .
and maybe like .
that's all really .
so what's going on in this picture ?
so a boy he was out scuba diving .
and he found a squid and the squid and him became friends .
and then they bec wanted to become scientists .
and now they're doing experiments on rats and the rats wanted .
a couple rats got away .
and the squid's trying to look for the rats with a magnifying glass .
and he's reading a book about where rats hide .
and the boy is trying to hold up a lightbulb cause the power went off to .
from like using too much electricity .
and then he's trying to find the like place where the light .
well no the power didn't go out but his lightbulb fell out and he can't tell where it is where it goes back cause there's no light .
he's trying to figure it out .
and he's a very messy scientist because it's very messy .
that's a pretty good story you just came up with there .
why why do you think they're experimenting on the rats ?
what are they trying to figure out ?
like just i don't know .
like they just want to dissect rats .
which i would never do because i like rats .
alright fair enough .
anything else you want to say about this one ?
alright then we can move on to the next one .
jibo ?
thank you .
alright last one .
i see like a pasture, field, a giant radish i think, no radish or turnip .
i see a snail, bunch of leaves, i see a fence and i think it's like a bug or something on top of a shell can't tell what that is really .
and then i see clouds .
i see lots of plants and leaves and like that's basically all .
so what's the story ?
so a girl was .
lives on a farm and apparently planted i'm not quite sure what that is if it's a radish or not .
you can call it whatever it is .
i'll say it's a radish .
she planted radishes and one day she saw a giant stem in her yard and she dug up a ra a giant radish and like every snail like loves radishes .
the snails in the pasture love them so they got a turn to look at them and but it was too high off the ground for snails to eat .
then the girl showed her parents the giant radish and they sold it and got a mansion .
that's expensive radish, ?
well it's a giant radish .
it is a giant radish .
alright sounds good .
go ahead and hit another buzzer and we can move on to the next one .
you're doing an awesome job !
you are .

you're a really good reader !
do you have a favorite book ?
you do ?
what's your favorite book ?
it's either flawed dogs or smile .
i've not read those ones but those sound good .
alright same thing .
it's an it's a fact that some kids do not eat right .
if kids don't eat healthy foods, they can get sick .
to do your best, you must eat right .
i wanted to help the kids eat right, so i helped i helped start a garden at school, like the garden at the white house .
i asked my friends at school to help me and they said yes !
they were all really excited .
then i asked our teacher miss burns to help us .
that is such a good idea, theo, miss burns said .
i would be happy to help !
miss burns asked .
miss .
i'd be happy to help !
miss burns asked our principal if we could use a part of the playground to make a raised garden bed .
principal said yes !
i asked my grandfather tuh if he could help us too .
my grandfather said yes !
he is an excellent builder and he made the he made the raised bed for us .
in the early spring, miss burns helped us plant plaplant the seeds in cups in our classroom .
we watched the seeds sprout through the soil and growing into seedlings .
in may, it was time to plant the seedlings .
we grew lots of vegetables .
we had to make sure the plants had pleplenty of water .
in the summer, we took turns coming to school and taking care of the plants .
by july, the garden was looking great .
there there were lots of vegetables and they tasted fresh .
when school started again, there were plenty of vegetables so all the helpers had fresh vegetables for lunch .
in the fall we had a harvest party to celebrate the garden .
it felt good to work hard on the garden and know know that we helped the children eat healthy .
okay and last one and then after that i want you to tell me what story you like the most .
okay .
this week my grandpa came to visit us .
my grandma lives fuhfar away .
she will stay us with us for a week .
i like it when my grandma visits .
she's the best she's a good cook .
my grandma makes the best fried chicken and the best gingerbread .
grandma's gingerbread is so good because she makes it with molasses .
it's very sweet and rich .
she knows i love these fried chicken .
she knows i love .
she knows i love these foods so she always makes them for me .
last night, we had fried chicken, greens, fried corn, and gingerbread .
i do not know what she will cook today today, but i bet it will be good .
my grandpa makes the best sweet potato pie .
i want him to make a sweet potato pie for my birthday .
i i can make you a sweet potato pie my grandpa told me but i want you to help me so you learn how to make it too .
this made me feel really special .
sweet potatos boiled as we made the bottom of the crust crust .
grandma showed me how .
grandpa showed me how to do this part .
and we get the sweet .
when sweet potatos are ready, we mashed them .
get the sugar, milk, and eggs grandpa told me .
i stirred the potato filfilling .
we poured the potato filling into the crust .
grandpa slid the pie into the oven .
let's go to the grocery store and get whip cream from the for the top !
so you read four different stories, which one was your favorite ?
probably this one .
this one ?
me too .
alright so that's all for this part so you want to go ahead hit another buzzer maybe one you haven't yet ?
i think i've hit all of them .
great job !
i guess you have hit most of them .
well you can hit two at once, one that's your favorite, whichever one .
i'll hit these two .
alright good job .
alright this one, super simple, i want you to tell me what they're doing in the picture and then how you would do it .
there's a man brushing his teeth .
and i'd probably do it two times a day .
in the morning like when you wake up and at night before you go to bed .
i would probably do like the .
not like the top and bottom of your teeth and then do like the front of your teeth and the back and sometimes you i feel like people .
someone once said like that it's good to brush your tongue or something and like the roof of your tongue .
i forget why they said that but i just do it .
that's probably how i'd do it .
alright that's good .
next one .
next .
some of these are silly .
just like a little boy washing his hands .
and i'd probably get a lot of soap and then like wash em for like maybe fifteen seconds .
kind of depends .
and then i'd dry my hands off like a paper towel and then like shake them off .
this shows like a boy tying his shoes .
and i'd probably tie mine like it's hard to explain how to tie your shoes .
but i'd probably like make cross the two things, make one bunny ear, then like wrap the other lace around it, then make anuh then somehow pinch the two sides together and then pull it and then just wrap them around again to make a double knot .
very confusing to explain that .
i know it is but you did a good job .
this shows a girl pouring cereal .
and i'd probably pour the cereal, pour milk in the cereal, and then get milk to drink .
i like milk .
and that's probably how i'd do that .
what's your favorite cereal ?
lucky charms .
lucky charms are good .
this shows a boy getting dressed .
and i'd probably like .
do they put on the shirt, put on underwear, put on pants, wait no put on socks, then pants, and then that's how i'd do that .
sometimes i put on a hat when it's cold outside .
this one shows a girl baking cupcakes .
and i'd probably like i don't i'm not quite sure how you make cupcakes .
i'd probably like put milk in, flour .
and like a bunch of other stuff .
and then i'd cook it in like the oven or something .
i don't know how long they need to be cooked but i then frost them when they're done and then put a bunch of sprinkles on them .
what's your favorite flavor of cupcake ?
red velvet .
red velvet's good .
do you think red velvet or chocolate tastes different ?
this shows a girl like painting i think ?
and i'd probably first get a piece of paper like canvas or something and i'd put all like two of every color that i would need .
and like so like i could be able to mix the colors .
and i would like mix them like i would first draw a lot like an outline of whatever i was making, then fill it in with whatever i was like whatever color that would it would need and then probably i don't depending on what it was i might add glitter or something depending what it was .
shows a boy buckling his seat belt .
and i'd probably just like sit in the seat, then pull it like over my shoulder and buckle it .
it's kind of pretty simple, isn't it ?
it's pretty simple .
this shows a girl feeding her teddy bear .
i'd probably get the bear and like set it down then maybe get like my food or something and add it on and like pretend like i'm feeding my teddy bear but not .
don't make it touch it because then it'd probably get stained and that's probably how i'd do that .
do you ever feed your teddy bears ?
not really .
this shows i can't really tell if that's a boy or a girl, think it's a boy, or a girl, i can't tell .
so there's a kid in here i think he's like having .
they're having a fashion show or something .
i think .
and i'd probably like show a friend or something .
then i'd go in my closet and get on whatever i was wearing then i'd come like out of my closet and stuff and i have this watch that has like a plus sound and i'd probably like do that .
and that's probably how i'd do that .
i know they're dressed up as like everything, aren't they ?
it's very hard to tell what like what gender they are it's very confusing .
maybe like a witch fairy slash .
business man .
business person .
alright .
this shows two kids sliding down the slide .
and i would probably like depending on how high the slide was i'd send my brother down first .
and then i'd go down .
and i'd try to land on my brother .
it's possible .
who's older, you or your brother ?
my brother .
this shows a boy playing soccer .
and i'd probably like find .
ask my mom if i could play soccer and she'd .
and then i'd pruh .
if i get on a team i'd probably like see what position i am what position i would play and then i'd try to kick the ball in to get the goals or like pass it to someone that could and that's probably what i would try to do .
pretty good .
this shows a two kids playing with blocks i think they're building something .
and i'd probably .
if they are building something i'd probably build the base and then like get it skinnier and skinnier .
as it goes up and then maybe like add supports or something .
this shows like maybe a girl and her dad or her mom .
like getting pushed on a swing and if i was the girl on the swing i'd probably like try to kick my legs back and forth .
and if i was the person pushing her i'd probably try to like push her every time she came back .
and not too high .
yup .
one more .
this i think shows a girl like sharing .
giving someone a lollipop .
and i'd probably .
like give .
like i probably wouldn't give it to a stranger .
i'd probably give it to someone i know and ask if they'd want a lollipop or something and if they say yes then i'd give them one .
then this shows a boy i think he's like thinking or in time out and i i would probably like sit sit there trying to get out of the time out .
like saying something .
i don't know what i'd say but i would try to get out of it .
or else i would think why i did what i did .
alright sound good .
go ahead and hit another buzzer for me and we're on our last one .

i mean if you have a picture you like you can tell me about it you can choose .
okay .
i'll just flip through them you can tell me which one you want to talk about .
any so far ?
yes .
which one ?
probably like the the pig in the bath tub and like i don't know if it was a donkey laying on the couch with all the money .
let's start with that one .
that's my favorite .
then we can go to the pig .
so i think the donkey like he had a birthday party .
and he got a lot of money from it and then he spent a bunch of his money on candy and then .
he's like he didn't notice how much money he spent .
and now he's wondering like wha where it all went because he only has coins .
and like then he didn't notice he spent like a thousand on a throne and like a hundred on candy .
i know it kinda looks like he ate a lot of candy doesn't it ?
and this one it looks like the pig he was getting really muddy outside or something and then he was like very mad because he had to take a bath and when he finally got in the bath he liked it and started playing with his toy boat .
i know .
he's a really cute pig isn't he ?

fifteen, sixteen .
heh .
it tricked you .
heh heh .
so .
it went from what to what ?
fifteen to twenty .
so what do you think might come next ?
sixteen ?
okay that's a really great guess .

what do you think might come next ?
twenty six .
that's also a very great guess .
man !
what's this ?

a garden is a place where people grow food or flowers .
gardens can be big or small .
gardens can be in the ground .
or they can be in a small pot .
gardens can be at home or at a church .
some kids have gardens at their school .
there are gardens at the white house .

you need four things to grow a garden .
a sunny spot, good spoil good soil, water, and time .

soil is a kind of dirt .
pile the soil up like a small hill .
so that the water can go down .
the pile of soil should be about twelve inches .
or the size of a ruler .
it is good for your plants if .
worms live in the soil .
to invite worms, put kkcut up leaves three inches down in your soil .
water .
gardens do well if they get about one inch of rain each week .
if it is hot and dry outside, you will need to give more water to your garden .
the best test is to put your finger in the soil .
if you get mud on your hands, it is too wet .
the soil's dusty .
the plant needs water .
time .
some plants grow in a few weeks .
others take a few months .
you must wait and take care of your plants .
then you can enjoy the food and flowers from your garden .

a goldfish .
pillows stacked on top of each other .
paper airplanes .
for some reason an airplane .
and clouds .
and tree .
and a window .
and a bed .
and a blanket .
and a sock .
and another pillow .

yes .
so do you all save the day together ?
yes .
we save people from villains like a pretend guy called red goblin or glitch .
which is .
i'm not even going to talk about that .
because that's probably going to take an hour of talking .
go for it .
about the back .
it's fine .
who's glitch ?
glitch is an alien from outer space .
which is like a glitched alien .
he landed in a junk yard .
and he sees all these parts .
so he goes into a computer .
and he gets like tinfoil for arms .
and some kind of tin stuff for legs .
garbage stuff .
and we're enemies .
because he tries to glitch our computers .
so the force field around our avengers tower would fall down .
and then all the bad guys will destroy it all .

well if both of them will land .
because even the different amount of weight they would still land at the same time .
that's awesome .
i tried to do that with my little metal mini figs of green goblin and hulkbuster but .
do you want to try one of these ones too ?
maybe .
here let's switch it out .
this one might be better .

so you think the octopus isn't actually there .
why is she imagining the octopus ?
maybe she's trying maybe it's her imaginary friend .
okay .
and what's the octopus doing then ?
helping her with science .

and i think what they're doing .
they might be looking at the fish .
or might be fishing .
and they look like they're having fun .
what why do you think the boy's and the lion's in the same boat ?
probably since cats and since lion is a species of cats .
they don't like water so it's in the boat .
and the boy's sitting in the boat trying to touch one of the flowers .
do you think they're friends ?
do you want to have a lion as a friend ?
no .
no ?
why not ?
cause it might eat me if i get mad at it .
okay .
that makes sense .

it's kind of weird though .
we have a lot of weird words in there .
alright .
so the next task, jibo is going to tell us what to do .
so jibo, you can take over .
hit a buzzer first .
yes, hit a buzzer first .
thank you .
you're doing great .
today, we're going to do an activity together .
i'm going to show you some pictures .

alright .
so let's look at the pictures .
what do you see in this picture ?
can you tell me what you see ?
why do you think this might be going on ?
maybe come up with a story behind what the picture is .
a lion and a boy riding a boat .
two upside down fish .
a dragonfly .
and flowers .
and water .
and mountains .
what do you think is going on in this picture ?
what do you think they're doing ?
where do you think they're going ?
where do you think they came from ?
maybe the boy came from his house .
and the lion came from the forest .
and they're going fishing .
or looking at the sea .
or the lake .
why do the think they're in the boat together ?
would you be in a boat with a lion ?
no .
no ?
because maybe they're friends from like a story book ?
true .
could be, .
anything else .
no .
alright, we can move on to the next one .
same thing .
paper airplanes .
a kid dressed up as a pilot .
toy cars .
clouds .
a window and a tree .
and pillows all over the bed .
and .
a sock .
why do you think there's no ceiling ?
because it's probably his imagination that he's flying in air .
like flying airplanes .
that's a good .
would you say his room is messy or clean ?
messy .
does that look like your room ?
or do you think your room's clean ?
kind of .
kind of ?
anything else you see or you want to talk about ?
no .
there's an octopus behind a girl in a science lab .
and he has a pencil and a book .
and beakers and some mice .
and charts .
do you think the octopus is a scientist ?
or do you think he's the experiment ?
he's the experiment .
what do you think she might be experimenting on octopus ?
maybe his hearts .
and like, to see if he could do, like, things .
that are helpful .
looks like it .
look at him .
he's writing, reading .
all of those things .
alright .
is there anything else you want to tell me about the picture ?
no ?
no .
you're doing an awesome job .
if you were to experiment on an animal, which animal would you choose and why ?
the unicorn because it's one of my favorite animals .
and to make one .
and then to make other ones so they can actually become a real animal again .
my gosh .
that would be so cool .
alright .
why don't .
are you ready to move on to the next one ?
alright .
a girl holding a, a .
giant, .
like, vegetable or something ?
and i see a .
some snails and more of the vegetable .
and a .
and a girl .
and fence .
fencing and the sky .
and a shovel .
what do you think she's doing ?
picking them so maybe she can make something with them .
why do you think it's so big compared to the other vegetables ?
maybe because she watered it extra .
have you ever planted a plant or a vegetable ?
which one ?
i'm i'm going to plant a cabbage .
and i've .
with my grandma, i helped her plant hu .
her strawberry garden .
that sounds so yummy .

all the children danced to the right .
all the children ssslid to the left .
then they took it back .
but before dj casper could say cha cha real smooth, something bad happened .
the cd player started skipping .
cha .
the students stopped dancing .
and ran off to find something else to do .
missus kent said deon .
do you mind if i take a look at the cd player ?
maybe i can fix it .
this happens all the time at home .
that would be wonderful said missus kent .
deon took the cd out and looked at the bottom of it .
it was scratched and a little dusty .
deon's checked to make sure his shirt was clean .
he wiped the cd with his shirt until it shined and then slid back into the player .
deon held his breath and pressed play .
dj casper started playing again .
cha cha now ya'll .

rosa was forty nine years old .
she was black and she waited for the bus to go home .
she was very tired .
rosrosa got on the bus and aa .
and sat down .
the seat she sat in was the front of the bus .
in nineteen fifty five, the city she lived in had an unfair law .
the law started that if .
that if there were not enough seats on the bus, white people .
black people must let the white people sit in their seats .
soon after rosa got on the bus, the seats were full .
then, more white people got on the bus .
the white people waited for rosa to get up from her seat .
rosa didn't think it was fair .
she didn't want to be treated poorly and long .
any longer just because she was black .
she said no and didn't .
and did not give up her seat .
rosa parks was arrested and put in jail .
many people found out what had happened .
some did not think it was fair and felt mad .
so the black people in her town decided we are not going to ride the bus until the law is changed .
for one year the black people did not ride the bus .
finally, the law was fixed .
rosa parks helped black people to be treated fairly .
she was a .
she was a role model and leader .
all across the united states, people began to insist on being treated fairly .

we had .
we got to take home these books on people from school .
and we made bottle buddies .

he's brushing his teeth .

i would do it by putting toothpaste on my toothbrush .
and then start brushing my teeth for two minutes .
sounds good .
my grandma's a dentist, so .
really ?
i'm a pre-dental student .
he's washing his hands .
and i would .
put soap .
two squirts of soap .
and then warm water for about a minute .
and then dry my hands off .
sounds good .
it looks like he's tying his shoes .
so first i would make an x .
and then loop one of the loops .
and then make it tight .
and then make two other loops and tie them together .
and make it tight .
do your sometimes laces come untied ?
mine do too .
mine are kind of short .
well that's good then .
she's .
pouring cereal into her bowl .
first i would put my cereal in .
in a bowl .
and then milk .
and then grab a spoon and eat it .
what's your favorite cereal ?
honeycombs .
sound good .
he's putting on a sweater .
first i would pick it out .
and then put it over my head and put my arms through .
she's frosting cupcakes .
so first i would make my cupcakes .
and then put it into a piping bag or something .
and then i would make, , swirls with it .
with the frosting .
what flavor of cupcakes would you make ?
birthday cake .
oo .
have you ever made birthday cake cupcakes ?
she's painting .

i drew a picture of a dog i really wanted when i was like five or something .
he's buckling his seat .
first, i would grab the seat belt .
and then i would bring it over me .
and then buckle it in .
she's feeding one of her toys .
maybe i would just set a bowl out .
and then pretend i had food .
and then take a spoon .
and then put it by its mouth .
have you ever done that ?
me and my cousins .
we used to .
like put out chairs and table .
and she would take water and then put them in cups .
and then hehe .
you'd have a tea party ?
we would have a fake tea party .
that's so fun .
so fun .
i did that too .
but i forced my parents to sit with me .
alright .
and then the last one for this set .
looks like she's dressing up .
i would just go in my, .
my mom's closet .
cause she has all my dress up stuff in there .
and then just put random things on .
where do you think she's going ?
trick or treating .
i don't know .

my grandma gave it to my mom because my grandpa's a farmer .
that's so sweet .
alright .
we can just keep going with these since you're so well .
they're going down a slide .
and .
i would climb up the steps .

i would take my soccer ball and put it down .
and i would, , kick it .
do you play soccer ?
no .
no .
do you play any sports ?
softball, basketball .
and i might play soccer .
you are so athletic .
they're playing .
they're making a .
tower out of building blocks .
first i will get .
i would get my building blocks out .
and then i just stack them up .
and see how high i could get them .
before they fall over, .
it looks like, .
he's pushing, , maybe his sister on the swing .
first i would get on the swing .
i would .
and then push them .
and then pump .
and then pump my legs .
do you usually have someone push you ?
or do you just do it yourself ?
i just do it myself .
a couple more .
maybe they're like trading candy or something .
so maybe i would take two .
like, some different candies .
and then trade with my friends or my cousins .
i don't know if you guys ever did this .
but did you ever trade silly bands ?
no .
no ?
no ?
i guess that was us .

alright now jibo here's going to give us the instructions for this next task .
i put .
today we're going to do an activity together .
i'm going to show you some pictures and you're going to tell me about them .
alright, so we're going to do what jibo says, okay ?
i see a tiger .
i see a boat .
i also see a boy .
i see fish .
i see a flower .
i see a lily pod .
i see .
is that a mountain ?
i think that's a mountain .
flowers .
i think another fish .
is this an onion ?
it kinda looks like it, ?
i don't know .
i think this is a ll .
water ?
awesome .
fly ?
a fly ?
i don't know what they're called .
i just call them flies .
so then what's going on this picture, like what's happening ?
the tiger .
no the lion and the boy are in a boat .
i'm guessing they're trying to get the flower cause the boy has his hand out .
the fish is upside down .
is that a good thing ?
i don't know .
i don't know .
so .
why .
how do you think they got here ?
like how did he get with the lion to do that even in the first place ?
i don't know .
maybe the lion likes .
maybe it's the boy's pet ?
would you have a lion as a pet ?
my brother would .
that makes sense .
and so they're .
they're going to look for you said the flower ?
what about the flower is special do you think ?
could be ?
i don't know, maybe it's for his mom ?
that's a good idea .
so where are they then ?
they're in a lake .
alright so you think the boy lives close by or how did they kinda get to .
where'd the boat come from ?
i don't know .
maybe they live nearby i think ?
okay .
i don't know .
awesome .
anything else you can tell me about what they're doing or in this picture ?
well the tiger's looking .
the lion's looking at the fly .
for what reason ?
i think he's hungry ?
i don't know .
a bug only lion ?
i don't know .
no that's a good idea .
makes sense why the boy would be in the boat with him then .
alright anything else ?
i don't think so .
alright same thing here .
i see a boy .
i see airplanes .
i see books .
i see a fish .
i see toys .
i see a messed up bed .
i see .
i see the outside .
i think that's a st tree stub ?
there's a picture frame .
there's clouds .
he's wearing a helmet .
i duh .
i see a sock .
i don't see anything else .
so what is he doing ?
what's going on with him ?
he's flying airplanes .
how so ?
maybe he wants to be a pilot ?
that's a good guess .
do you .
so do you have clothes like that ?
or what do you like to play dress up as ?
i don't know i just like to be a little everything .
a little bit of everything ?
so is this kind of .
is this real or what's going on here ?
i think he's just imagining .
imagining ?
that's awesome .
and so you said it's kind of messy ?
did ?
what what .
does your room look like this or ?
no .
no ?
what's different about it ?
not anymore .
not anymore .
the bed is the same .
i .
the toys are actually .
some of the toys are in my closet .
my laundry is in the laundry basket .
that's good .
the books are all upstairs .
i don't have fish, though .
gotcha .
so .
okay .
so what ?
but i definitely don't have as many pillows .
that makes sense .
so what .
what kind of clothes are these that he's wearing ?
airplane ?
he's wearing a helmet with goggles .
anything else you can think of about this picture ?
actually i kind of see like what .
there's kind of like little things .
squid arms ?
i don't know .
cool .
i don't .
but i don't know .
i see a squid .
i see a magnifying glass .
i see a girl .
i see a rat .
i see books .
i see science stuff .
i see a light bulb .
i see a book .
i see a pencil .
i see another rat !
what are they doing there ?
maybe she wants to become a scientist ?
cause the squid's kinda like .
having has this thing up to this .
and she has her chart .
maybe the rats mean she's like the scientist ?
cause .
and so what else tells you she's the scientist in here ?
well there's like .
there's molecules .
and there's like this science stuff in the room .
so what's the squid doing ?
is he helping or is he part of her experiments ?
like what's ?
i think he's part of the experiment because he's in a tank .
okay .
so what kind of experiments does it look like she might be running ?
i think she looks like she's trying to get the bulb running .
i don't know .
i don't really know .
but .
anything else you recognize up here that looks like you can tell me what it is ?
well there's this thing, but i don't know what that is .
kinda .
it .
maybe you're supposed to smash stuff in it ?
that's a good idea .
i don't .
that's it .
really know .
okay .
i see a girl ?
i see a big radish .
i see a .
i don't know what that is .
a slug ?
and i see more radishes and i see a shovel .
i think she wants to be a gardener ?
think she wants to be a farmer .
cause there's like these .
all of these radishes .
and then there's like .
she's wearing like farm clothes .
i would know because i actually kinda live on a farm .
no i think that's a good guess .
so, what .
whose farm is this right now ?
do you think ?

or her grandpa .
or aunt or uncle's .
have you ever been on a farm before ?
yes cause i kinda live on a farm .
i live on a .
well .
chicken farm .
that would make sense .
i live on a chicken farm .
we have a garden back .
out there my dad kinda just plants everything .

and like snap peas .
it sounds like you all are better farmers than she is .
she's only got huge radishes ?
true .

no .
alright well you're did awesome go ahead .
you're doing great .
great job .
go ahead and read this for me .
i'm not really good at reading .
but .
i don't know what that word is .
yup just give it your best guess and move on .
the world .
the word juh duh-juhdjembe means everything come together in peace .
this drum is played to tell a story .
people often come together to play their drum in a group .
three or four may be played together .
to make a drum tuh kuh-kuhcolor .
i don't know what that word is .
people come together to hear the drum music and they like to be .
the people also tell a story with their .
i don't know what that is .
just try to sound it out and then you can move on .
duh-dddancing ?
good job .
the duh-dehdjembe drum has a sh sell sherl sure ?
the top is made for the skin of a goat .
it can be different ruhread rezreasons differences ?
this kid of drum .
this kind of drum can be twelve to fifteen inches around round and as high as twenty three to twenty five inches tall .
it can be eleven to twenty nine puhpounds .
this kind of drum can make different kinds of sounds .
it can sound low or it can sound high .
the music can also be quite quiet or it can be very luhloud .
a luhlong time ago only the men would play the drum .
it was really to see a woman play a drum in west africa so people were suh finned when they say a woman djembe drum player .
player .
the women had to work very hard to get to play now .
there are womwomen drum kuhcolors and they .
and the womwomen are just as good at playing the music as the men .
this kind of drum was first played in west africa, but now it is played all over the world .
it is even played in our city .
the next time you list to .
listen to music, you may hear the beat of the djembe drum in the song .
thank you for working really hard at that .
you did awesome .
okay .
go ahead and hit a buzzer .
i think i hit this .
you're doing an awesome job .
try again make the sound .
there you go .
alright i want you to tell me what's going on in this picture .
the ma .
step by step how you would do it, okay ?
the boy is brushing his teeth .
i would probably put the water on first and then the toothpaste and brush my teeth .
and then i would rinse it off and then put the stuff back where it belongs .
i would .
this .
the boy is washing his hands .
i would probably get my hands wet first and then wash my hands with soap and water .
and then i would turn off the thing and i would dry my hands .
i don't really know how to tie my shoes .
i don't know how to tie shoes yet .
that's okay .
but .
how do you put your shoes on that don't have laces ?
i just like put my socks on and slide them on .
so .
i would probably put my cereal in first and then the milk and then get the spoon out and then eat it .
i would probably put my clothes back first and then put on my pants, my shirt, and then my socks .
and what's he doing ?
he's putting on a shirt .
what's going on here ?
i would probably bake the cupcakes first and then and then put the icing on and then put the sprinkles on .
and what is she doing ?
she's baking .
i would probably get my picture drawn out first and then paint it .
and then probably after it i would probably clean up my mess .
that's a good thing .
so what is she doing ?
she is painting .
what kind of things do you like to paint ?
i like to paint horses .
i like to paint animals .
those are hard to draw .
stuff like that .
that's awesome .
what's he doing ?
he's buckling his seat belt .
i would grab muh .
i would put myself in the chair first and then put muh .
and then i would put my seat belt on and just .
what's going on here ?
she's feeding a teddy bear .
i would probably make sure that the kid doesn't have anything in the bowl before she does that .
that's pretty smart .
what kind of things do you like to play pretend with ?
do you have stuffed animals or ?
i just like to use my imagination .
so .
it seems like that's what she's doing, ?
what's going on here ?
i can't tell if that's a boy or a girl .
i'm not sure .
but looks like she's dressing up and looks like she has .
i would probably make sure the door is shut before i put all that stuff on .
and then .
i would probably put the tutu on first and then the bowtie .
and then the hat, the glasses, then the shoes and then the .
scarf .
do you have dress up clothes at home ?
but they're .
what kind do you have ?
i have princesses stuff but it probably won't fit me anymore .
what's your favorite princess ?
probably elena of avalar .
makes sense .
what do what do you dress up as for halloween ?
i don't really do halloween so .
well at least you still dress up .
what's going on here ?
it looks like people sliding down a slide .
i'd probably make the slide is steady .
and make sure it's not wet .
do you .
what's your favorite thing to do at the play ground ?
probably monkey bars .
i like to try stuff some stuff new .
that's awesome, those are pretty hard .
they are they are .
looks like they .
looks like he's playing soccer .
i'd put my shoes on .
make sure that they are tied or everything .
and then i would probably just get a soccer ball and start practicing .
how .
what are the rules of soccer ?
you can't touch the ball, you can only kick it .
only the goalie can touch the ball .
and so what are you trying to do with the ball ?
you're trying to get it in the goal .
gotcha .
looks like they're trying to build a tower .
first i would get the supplies out and then put the first layer on and the then second layer and then the third or how many levels .
you want to have .
do you like to play .
you play with like blocks or do you play with like legos or what do you ?
i play with barbie dolls .
barbie dolls, ?
what are the things you set up for your barbie dolls ?
i probably set up the bedroom and then i set up the kids rooms .
and then the kitchen and then living room and a bathroom .
awesome .
looks like a person swinging their daughter on a swing and .
looks like .
you ha .
i would probably make sure that my daughter is holding on .
so she doesn't fall off it .
i actually fell off of .
that's scary .
one one time and hit my head on the ground so .
man i'm glad you're okay but you're right .
that what you need to do to be safe .
i also bit through my tongue one time .
not very nice .
looks like she's sharing her candy with people .
i would probably make sure that no one had licked it first .
so, and that .
no one .
and that it didn't fall on the ground .
okay .
looks like he's thinking or he might be in time out .
i would probably make sure that the clock is on .
that makes sense .
what .
are you ever in time out for anything any more ?
no .
what did you used to go in to time out for when you were little ?
i don't really remember .
alright awesome go ahead and hit a button .
alright .
great job .
i'm just going to show you .
great job .
a few of my favorite pictures and then we'll be all done, okay ?
okay .
so what's going on here ?
i think .
looks like a girl is trying to get fireflies in space .
that's kind of silly, ?
and then there's like stars and planets and other stuff .
so what .
what .
who made this up ?
like what what's the point of getting fireflies and stuff do you think ?
are there fireflies in space ?
no .
okay so this is like .
no there's no aliens in space either .
cause i see anuh .
so this is just a pretend .
fun picture .
let's see what else we've got going on here .
what's going on here ?
it looks like there's a frog in a coffee cup and and the frog is wearing a crown .
that is what it looks like .
what would you do if you walked in and saw this in your kitchen ?
i would dump the frog outside .
would you keep the crown or let it .
him keep the crown ?
i would probably let him because i don't want to touch the slimy thing .
looks like the giraffe is eating paper or ham or something .
it looks like there's a double stacked sandwich thing .
so i don't know .
i don't know i think this is just imagination .
so is the sandwich for the giraffe or is the sandwich for the kid ?
i think it's for the kid, i don't know .
it's kinda hard to tell .
it looks like the goat is sitting on the chair and has a lot of money and candy on the floor .
if i walked into this thing i would dump the goat outside and clean up the mess .
or may i would .
i would make him clean up the mess first .
that would .
good luck getting the goat to do that .
no .
alright last one, what's going on here ?
it looks like there's a pig in the bath tub .
maybe the pig needed a bath ?
i don't .
i don't know .
i didn't, would not expect that ?
nope .
unless if i give the pig the bath outside .
i don't want it in my house .

today we're going to do an activity together .
i'm going to show you some pictures and you're going to tell me about them .
wait tell her what about what ?
look at the picture .
you can tell me what you see on there .
a lion with a kid on a boat in a lake with fish .
what else do you see kind of around ?
with ?
flowers .
a sn .
wait what are those ?
a dragon fly .
and lily pads .
can you tell me what's happening in this picture ?
like what are they doing ?
going for a boat ride ?
would you expect a lion to go for a boat ride with a boy ?
so what does that make you think ?
is this a story ?
is this pretend or ?
probably a story that's fiction .
so in this story then why are they on a boat together ?
where are they going ?
any guesses, ideas ?
they're going to the other side of the rainbow to find gold ?
that's a that's a great guess as good as any .
i don't know .
so where do you think they are ?
like we know it's a river, but where in the world is it ?
what does it look like ?
somewhere hot, somewhere cold, somewhere ?
probably somewhere hot .
do you recognize any of those plants ?
yes .
what what are they ?
flowers .
i recognize those .
cause i see them every day .
is there anything else weird or silly about this picture ?
this fish is upside down .
that's kind of weird .
what do you think that means ?
if he's upside down ?
maybe means just playing around or swimming around ?
maybe .
anything else you can think of or tell me about this picture ?
no, not really .
go to the next one .
what's going on here ?
there's this .
i think it's a boy who's pretending to be a pilot .
but he's on his bedroom, his bed .
whwhy do you think he's doing that ?
maybe cause he wants to be one when he grows up ?
do you like to pretend to be anything when you play ?
yes .
what do you like to pretend ?
that i'm a dancer .
that's a good goal as well .
so what else do you see here ?
kinda what's going on ?
his room is very messy .
it's probably summer cause there's a tree with leaves on his window .
and he has a lot of .
he has a fish .
and .
i don't know .
what are the clothes he's wearing ?
something a pilot would probably wear .
and what's all this drawing up here ?
what's, what is it ?
paper airplanes and, and like an old fashioned plane .
awesome .
does your room look like his room ?
no .
why not ?
i don't play with cars like this .
gotcha .
alright anything else you can think of about this picture ?
no .
okay .
there's a girl who wants to be a scientist but there's an octopus in her, in there .
i can't tell if the girl wants the octopus to be in there or if the octopus snuck in .
the picture doesn't help help you out in that regard .
well what's the octopus doing or holding onto ?
like stuff that she's researching .
so i'm pretty .
so like just looking at it, i think the octopus is helping her .
that's good deductive reasoning .
so what .
you said the girl is a scientist .
what makes you think that from what she's doing or wearing ?
cause she has safety goggles on and she's holding a lightbulb .
so what kind of experiment do you think that means she's doing ?
how to like use electricity .
kind of scary stuff .
what else is in her lab that you see ?
mice .
is that what you would expect to see ?
or why do you think they're there ?
maybe they're her pets .
or something .
do you recognize anything, any of the symbols or materials she's using ?
what they are ?
no .
nothing ?
i've seen these but i can't remember what they're called .
what about some of these things ?
oo a microscope and a pencil .
alright .
anything .
what'd you see ?
a plant .
anything else here ?
no .
well, the farmer just grew a massive radish .
this is pretty big .
is the radish big or is she small ?
the radish is big .
what else do you see going on ?
there are snails that might want to eat her plant, plants .
does it look like she grows anything else or does it look like just the radishes or ?
i don't know .
i can't tell if these are radishes or carrots .
right that one kinda looks a little smaller i guess like a carrot .
i don't know .
what what's going on with her outfit ?
do you think she's dressing up or she's .
that's just what she wears ?
i just think that's just what she wears .
what .
what's next to her ?
what's she using that for ?
a shovel to dig up the plants .
have you ever been on a farm before ?
what else .
what other kinds of things do you see on a farm ?
a lot of plants .
a lot of pla .
that makes sense .
it seems kinda hard she doesn't have any machines to help her though ?
do you think this is a big farm or is it just kind of like a garden ?
a big farm .
what makes you think that ?
cause there's a gate over here .
and it looks really long .
that makes sense .
anything else you can think of about this picture ?
no .
alright good job describing .
you can hit a buzzer .
we're all done with that .
okay .
you're doing an awesome job .
alright .
go ahead and read this out for me .
this story takes place in nineteen fifty five .
one day rosa parks had a long day at work .
rosa was twenty four, no forty two years old .
she was black .
she waited for the bus to go home .
she was very tired .
rosa got on the bus and sat down .
the seat she sat in the fr .
was in in was in the front of the bus .
in nineteen fifty five, the city she lived in had an unfair law .
the law stated if there were not enough seats for the bus for white people, black people must let the white people take their seats .
soon after rosa got on the bus, the seats were full .
then, more white people got on the bus .
the white people waited for rosa to get up from the from her seat .
rosa didn't think it was fair .
she did not want to be treated poorly any longer just because she was black .
she said no and did not give up her seat .
rosa parks was arrested and put in jail .
many people found out what had happened .
some did not think it was fair and felt mad .
so the black people in her town decided we are not going to ride the bus until this law is changed .
for the year, for one year the black people did not ride the bus .
finally, the law was fixed .
rosa parks had helped black people to tr to pe people to be treated fairly .
she wuh, she was a role model and a leader .
all across the united states, people began to insist on being treated fairly .
awesome .

what about this one ?
nineteen plus one equals .
i mean nineteen minus one equals eighteen .
awesome .
six divided by three .
this is a times sign .
i mean tie .
six times three equals .
eighteen ?

this one's a bit trickier .
twenty .
you can just read it if you want or you can you can try to answer if you'd like .

today we're going to do an activity together .
i'm going to show you some pictures .
and you're going to tell me about them .
awesome !
thank you jibo .
so this is going to be our first picture .
alright ?
so can you tell me what you see here ?
i see a boy in the like a a maybe like a river maybe or lake .
and then a lion .
maybe it's a friendly lion .
and they're riding the boat to their destination .
maybe .
where do you think they're going ?
i think they're going .
i think the boy found the lion .
and the lion was not in its home, so they're maybe taking it to it's home ?
that's a good idea .
awesome .
what do you see here ?
i see fish .
wait is that a fish or kitten ?
i think it looks, they look like fish .
cause i see an eye .
i see like little fins .
and that's in .
and then frogs jump on these lilypads .
so those might be fish with lilypads on the top .
anything else you see here ?
i see .
here .
some flowers and some plants back here .
and a fly .
and i also and that .
a little weird for a lily pad .
it's like look like a pizza .
kind of .
you're right !
like pieces of pizza .
so you said that they're going somewhere .
how do you think they ended up here ?
like why are they in a boat ?
i think they they were they were in a place where the lion can't live .
and then they saw a boat that someone's about to get in but they stole it real quickly .
and then they're rowing to the place that they have to go to .
the wild .
so they can th .
so the lion can go to it's family .
how do you think the boy and the boy and the lion met each other ?
i think that their parents they were walk looking around or taking a walk .
and the lion was hiding or something in a cage .
and he wanted to get him out so they he got him out .
and then they got the boat .
and they were running to the place where it should belong .
you're .
that's a great idea .
thank you .
that that seems a very possible .
so would you ever be friends with a lion ?
if it was a nice lion maybe .
if it was it did look like it was going to bite me then no .
but if it look nice, then maybe .
that makes sense but do you have any pets ?
no .
no ?
do you want any ?
yes .
what do you want ?
i want a dog .
really .
yes .
what type ?
do you know ?
i either want a ssshih tzu i mean shih tzu or a german shepherd .
oo .
well i hope you get one soon .
i know .
anything else you want to say about this one ?
there's like little circles there .
they might be bubbles coming out from .
they're making bubbles that come up .
maybe .
i think .
seems possible .
so would you ever go on a lake like this ?
if i was on a boat, yes .
i wouldn't swim in it but if i was on a boat, yes .
what would you do on the boat ?
i would probably .
just i would bring an umbrella in case it rained .
and then i would just be on it .
i just be rowing out .
and i'd look down and see the lily pads .
see the frogs jumping on the lily pads .
and see the fishies .
sounds like a lot of fun .
alright .
anything else you want to say about this picture ?
no .
okay .
we can go to the next one .
you did great .
thank you .
alright .
so what do you see here ?
i see a boy on his bed dressed like a pilot or so, a plane flyer i think .
and he want .
and he has these paper paper planes that he can throw out the window and see if they fly .
and he wants to be a pilot i think .
and so he has the whole outfit on .
and he's trying to make those little things fly, in the air .
and that's why he's on his bed .
his room's a little messy .
he's trying to do it .
or he might be pretending like he's imagining flying .
and then pretending that planes were coming near him i think .
maybe .
i think that's a great idea of what might be happening .
and then his little fishy right there .
what other things do you see ?
i see clouds .
little clouds right here .
i think that he hanged up clouds from his room .
with tape .
and then the clouds are coming down right there .
so he's pretending like the airplanes are flying .
that is such a great idea .
i never thought about him hanging them there .
do you do stuff like that ever ?
i i tt sometimes i like to make those little thingies sometimes there because i don't really know how my mom makes them .
i can see if they can fly maybe .
would you ever become a pilot .
not one of my things i want to be .
what do you want to be ?
a fashion designer .
very cool .
thank you .
what type of stuff do you like to design ?
i like to design fancy dresses, party dresses .
i can do wedding dresses but i like the party outfits .
well i'm sure you can do it one day .
thank you .
what other things do you see ?
on the floor or on the shelf ?
i see books, a picture of bubbles i think .
and then cars and a sock and a pillow .
i think his room is a little messy but he wants to play instead of clean it up .
so that's what he's doing .
is your room this messy ?
little bit messier probably .
you don't like cleaning it ?
only when my mom tells me to .
okay, i'll clean it .
do you play games like this in there ?
i usually go downstairs and play with my barbie dolls because i don't want to bring my barbie dolls up to my room because it's up there .
my parents, my mom and poppie are down there so i want to be with them when i'm down there .
but when i'm up there, i after i after it's time to go to bed, i do have some ipad time .
like watch a show or something .
i play with stuffed animals in there .
it's pretty much .
what shows do you like to watch ?
i like to watch a show sydney to the max .
and also this other show .
it's called duck tales .
i like that .
i've heard of that one .
it's kinda like mystery so kinda like that .
very cool .
anything you want to say about this one ?
well i think he opened the window so like the planes would like fly out there .
and they can fly in the air .
do you think he writes any messages on the planes ?
he might be .
he might message .
maybe he has a neighbor that he's friends with .
and he wants to pr dress up like a pilot .
and then he wants to throw the messages over there .
then he would throw the messages .
to a friend ?
his next door neighbor .
what do you think he would right on it ?
if it's his friend .
i think he would write how you doing, i'm playing a pilot game, would you want to come over and play i think .
the new texting .
awesome .
anything else about this one ?
i'm on linux .
jibo is so silly .
jibo's trying to distract us .
alright .
well you did such a good job with this one .
thank you .
i loved hearing your creativity .
what do you think'think is happening here ?
i think she's trying to find a light bulb .
and she finally found one for an experiment .
and she doesn't know there's an octopus behind her stealing all her ideas .
and then going to the under the sea world to go to his own science lab .
that's not good right ?
stealing .
and she does .
what is that ?
she's just looking at that .
just walking away .
and then he's alright, she's gone, grab all you need .
so what do you think she's doing ?
i think she has this little little thing she's building .
little machine .
and how to turn on a light with your mind .
maybe ?
and so she's trying to get a light bulb that kinda can do that .
and then trying to turn it on .
and she's so happy that she found a light bulb .
she doesn't even looking behind her .
what a good idea .
well hopefully she turns around, right ?
what's that ?
those are mouses or rats .
i can't really tell .
what are they doing ?
i think they're helping the octopus for the look out .
maybe .
cause that one's kinda looking over there .
looking over there .
and that one's waiting for th her to walk .
and then giving them the signal .
gosh .
what things do you see ?
i see science experiments that she did .
i see this little thing .
i think they're explaining the honey things that they have, the ants, the bees go in .
and then she has this little thing that think she carries honey from that experiment in there .
and then she has beakers .
i think those are called beakers .
and then they have all these other stuff that she could use to put it in her other experiment, but she's working on this one right now .
what a great explanation .
so what what are these ?
they're books that can help her make the science experiment .
helping her, so this equals that .
she get .
have you ever done a science experiment before ?
yes .
one time we were learning about sugar .
and .
no .
i have i have a better one .
or like dirt .
and we had this big thing of dirt .
and we put a ice cube down it that made it wet .
and then we put water .
that made it all wet .
even water .
and then the science teacher told us so would you want to step in this ?
and we're like no, we'd get our feet all wet and all dirty .
so i think that's one of the experiments we did .
and then we did the sugar .
two cubes .
and then when we shake them really fast, it would break up .
and then if you put water in it, they would kinda disappear .
and you can't really see them .
they'd go to bottom .
so if you didn't look at the bottom, you'd be like where'd they go ?
then when you look at the bottom you'd see them .
woah .
you're like a scientist .
very cool .
thank you .
anything else you want to say about this one ?
i liked your idea about the light bulb .
thank you .
would would you like being able to turn the my turn the lights on with your mind ?
but in our mind we use miss alexa .
turn on first plug and see those .
they can do that, right ?
and sometimes when i want to play songs she's like sorry, i don't know that .
and then .
sometimes they don't hear it .
then when i say can i can i see megalodon, can i see megalodon pictures .
she's like sorry can't do that .
then when i add megalodon search, then she does it .
what else is called megalodon ?
don't know that .
is that is that a singer or what's that ?
in a megalodon, it's a under the sea creature that exists a long long time ago .
it's huge .
it's a huge version of the shark .
woah .
it was really big .
very cool .
i didn't know even that .
well .
thank you for teaching me .
we can go to the next one .
alright .
what do you see here ?
i see a girl .
and she was planting .
i think those are radishes maybe .
and she was digging for the radishes .
and then finally she found a huge one .
and she woah !
and so she i'm going to bring this in so it can feed all the family .
and there's snails right there .
i think they have .
they're just eating the plants maybe .
and she finds that one .
she wants to take it to her home to feed the people .
how nice of her .
does she share in ?
sharing, in her garden .
well it's kinda her mom and dad's but she does it sometimes .
it's like one of her chores maybe to pick them out .
do you ever share ?
yes i do share .
what do you share ?
one time i was coloring and my friend friend didn't have an orange .
and i had two oranges, so i gave her one of my oranges .
how nice .
thank you .
so what other stuff do you see going on ?
i see plant .
i see the top of these .
and the radishes needs, she needs to pick out .
and then the snails are just eating the these parts .
the leaves .
and she's pulling those out .
she she pulled those out .
she's supposed to pull the rest .
and then she's like .
then she finally pulled the huge one out .
do you think she was expecting this one ?
nope !
she's expecting those sizes .
do you ever garden like this ?
we don't have a garden .
we just, we just .
the rain usually waters it for our .
and we have a mower who mows our our grass but .
i did have a plant once but then i forgot about it .
then it no !
then it just pss .
so gotta throw it away but i still have a cup in though .
if you did have a garden, what fruit or veggie would you want to plant ?
i would want to plant .
well not really radishes .
don't really like them .
no radishes ?
real things or imaginary ?
whatever you want .
this is your garden .
i would want to plant grapes cause that's my favorite .
i would want to plant oranges so oranges .
and then i'm going to plant strawberries .
oo .
and bananas .
those are things i'd want to plant .
i don't want to have a bunch then i'd be need a lot of boxes but those are the ones that i'd want .
that's awesome .
that sounds like a great plan .
i love that .
thank you .
anything else about this one you want to talk about ?
well she has a shovel so she's digging them out .
and then she cleans them off .
and then there she goes .
then she digs that one out .
and then kinda pulled on it .
and kinda helped dig it .
and then she found it .
then she cleaned it off with the dirt .
and she picked it out .
do you think this shovel is enough to get this out ?
no she had to use her hands .
and the shovel .
and all that stuff .
she probably had to have .
maybe she had a little brother who kinda helped her out a bit of it .
then he went back in cause it was hot outside .
so he then she got it out .
i don't think i could do that alone .
anything else about this one ?
you did a great job .

the djembe is .
a drum from west africa .
the world, the word djembe means, everyone come together in peace .
this drum is played to tell a story .
people often come together to play their , drum in a group .
three or four may be played together to make a drum circle .
people come together to hear the drum music and they like to dance to the beat .
the people also come to tell a story with their dancing .
the djembe has a shell made of hard wood .
the top is made from the skin of a goat .
it can be different sizes .
the kind of drum .
ththis kind of drum can be twelve or fifteen inches around .
and as high as twenty three to twenty five inches tall .
it can be eleven to nine twenty nine pounds .
this kind of drum can make different kinds of sounds .
it can sound low .
or it can sound high .
the music can also be quite quiet or it can be very loud .
a long time ago ow only the men would play a drum .
it was rare to see a woman play a drum in west africa .
to peep .
so people were surprised when they saw a woman djembe player .
the woman had to work very hard to get to, get to play .
now there are women drum circles .
and the women are just as good as, at playing the the music as the men .
this kind of drum was first played in west africa but now it is played all over the world .
it is even played in our country .

today is the big day .
rena yelled as she ran out of her room .
today is the party for kai .
rena was happy about kai's birthday party at the skating rink .
rena and kai were best friends and they liked roller skating together .
all the girls in her class were invited to the party .
rena got to the party ss early so she could warm up before the party began .
rena liked to go fast in the fog .
the rink was lit red and blue and green lights .
the different colors made rena's pants with ssswag sparkle .
rena skated to the song billie jean .
when the other girls got to the party they saw rena skating quickly around the rink .
said jen .
rena is a good skater .
this looks like fun .
let's have fun like rena said jen .
all the girls walked quickly to the rink floor except for jess and kim .
they walked slowly .
i do i do not know how to skate said jess .
i do not know how either said kim .
watch us said rena .
and kai and rena skated fast across the floor .
now you try said kai .
jess and kim moved slowly .
as they began to skate the girls fell down .
good try said rena and kai as they helped the girls up .
we will teach you how to skate .
hold our hands .
rena and kai did not skate fast .
they went slowly as they helped jess and kim .
next time we will go fast said kai .
the girls smiled .
good job !
have you been skating before ?
yes !
i have my own ss pair of roller blades that can turn into roller skates .
and then back to roller blades .
that's so cool .
i've never seen that .
how'd it go ?
it was fun .
because we have this like loop by our house .
and we ride there .
on our bikes and our scooters and our skates .
that's so fun .
you're probably better than me .
i'm awful at skating .
alright could you read this one too ?
it was bab's birthday .
and she was excited to take a birthday surprise to school .
bab made cupcakes in a cookie bake oven to take to school as her surprise .
bab's mom helped her .
bab liked to frost the top .
she spread yellow, pink, blue, green and orange frosting on top of each treat .
bab liked orange the best .
when it was time for bab to go to school, she did not ride the bus .
she did not her surprise to get squished .
so bab's mom drove her to school in the van .
bab felt very special .
she was happy to share with her class .
after lunch the teacher said class it is time to sing bab's for for bab's birthday .
mrs glad had bab come to the front of the class .
she got to sit in the chair with wheels as the class sang happy birthday to you .
happy birthday to you .
happy birthday dear bab .
happy birthday to you !
bab smiled .
she started passing out her treats and let each student pick one .
bab wanted to get eat an orange one so she set it on her bleh left .
when she got to the last student there were three cupcakes left .
fern said no thank you .
i want an orange one but they are all gone .
bab looked at the orange one on her desk .
she thought i want to share on my birthday .
i will give the orange one to fern .
bab gave fern the orange cupcake and took a pink one for herself .
both girls smiled as they ate bab's birthday surprise .
that's nice .
awesome !
sharing is caring .
okay .
thank you .
thank you jibo .
do you want to read this one too ?
okay !
grandma has a big house with lots of steps .
she has a bad leg so i run up and down the stairs to get her medicine and slooper slippers .
i like to help her .
mama and i need to find a new home .
grandma wants us to live with her .
i want to live with grandma .
on sunday i was visiting grandma .
she fell on the steps and broke her leg .
i was scared .
i had to get help .
i called nine one one .
the ambulance took grandma to the hospital .
grandma and mama told me i did the right thing .
we will live with grandma said mama .
she needs a good smart and kind boy like you .
i was so happy to live with grandma !
one morning grandma told me to watch the pancakes while she set while she let the cat out .
do not touch the pan said grandma .
when grandma left i tried to flip the pancakes like the man on tv .
my pancakes went in the air .
and they came down but not in the pan .
the pancake batter went all over .
what a mess !
i was so scared .
grandma came back and said what happened kai kai'won ?
then grandma began to laugh hard .
she took .
she told me to look at myself .
i had batter spots all over my face .
i looked so funny .
and i laughed too .
we cleaned up the mess and made more pancakes .
they were the best pancakes ever !
nice .
have you made pancakes before ?
i help my mom make the batter .
and then i also pour some of them too .
what types do you like ?
i like regular pancakes .
but when we go to restaurants i usually get chocolate chip pancakes .
we went .
we got pancakes from a restaurant this morning .
really ?
yep .
you got chocolate chip ?
yep .
oo that's delicious .
awesome !
you did such a great job reading !
go ahead and hit a button !
awesome !
you're doing an awesome job !
so now .
thanks jibo .
jibo i think that maybe we can try the green task again ?
if jibo's good to go .
yes !
take it away !
today were going to do an activity together .
i'm going to show you some pictures .
and you're going to tell me about them .
look at the picture .
so what do you see there ?
what is this ?
i see a lion .
a boy .
i saw two fish .
and the lion and the boy were on a boat .
sailing on a big river with like huge fish .
with a bunch of lily pads .
and then there is a bunch of flowers behind them .
and i don't .
i think hills behind them ?
i don't know what that is .
but there's a dragonfly too .
so how do you think they got there ?
what's happening ?
i think that this boy was just trying to like ride a boat .
and then a lion just hopped in .
and then he was like okay let's just have a lion come .
so what are they doing now you think ?
sailing across the little river to try to get somewhere .
to get somewhere ?
where do you think they're going ?
maybe the little boy is trying to go home ?
jibo where'd the picture go silly ?
sometimes jibo does this .
but you did a great job explaining that .
thank you .
there it's back .
anything else about this one ?
would you ever ride with a lion ?
probably not .
why ?
unless it's like a baby lion .
then i th i wouldn't .
because i know lions are very dangerous .
if they're not .
if they're wild lions .
and if they're like .
if they were born in captivity then they are mostly likely to be close to humans .
and they probably trust humans more than a wild one would .
because people hunt lions .
so the ones not born in captivity would be scared probably .
and then that's when they would try to attack to protect their family .
do you think these ones are friends ?
yes .
cause they're in the boat ?
because he's the lion is just sitting down .
not doing anything .
just enjoying the view .
good !
anything else about this one ?
this big like flower things .
that i don't know what they are .
like right here .
what do you think they might be ?
i think they might be like big flowers .
so like maybe the ones that eat bugs ?
the plants that eat bugs .
maybe .
that's a good guess .
anything else ?
you seem to know a lot about flowers .
do you garden ?
not really but we plant .
we have flowers in our yard .
and we have a flower box .
kind of at the edge of our yard between our neighbor .
and we're growing like the really tall flower .
they're suppose to be like three feet tall .
woah .
and they're pretty big right now .
what types do you have ?
do you know like the names ?
no but my mom would .
okay .
that's okay !
that's awesome though .
alright so if you don't have anything else we can probably do the next one jibo .
alright .
there is a boy .
who has a paper airplane .
trying to throw it out his window .
and pretending like he's a pilot .
stomping on his bed .
and he has a bunch of cars .
and he a sock like that looks a baseball .
kind of .
and that's suppose to be his like his imagination probably .
because you can't have clouds in your room .
unless you have like hanging clouds like babies might have .
like a mobile .
if you could have ?
for babies .
something in your room what would you have if it were possible ?
i want a desk .
a desk ?
what would you do with your desk like ?
i would do my homework on there .
and i would probably put all my drawing stuff on it .
and put my computer there .
what type of drawings do you make ?
i'm really good at drawing eyes .
cool .
and some .
and i have a bunch of markers and drawing stuff that i could use .
awesome .
so it's fun .
cool !
so with this like what do you think is going on ?
how did he like come up with all that ?
i think that he probably wants to become like a pilot .
so that's why he is wearing all of that stuff .
and he has paper airplanes .
like he's pretending to guide them to an area .
okay so .
so that .
no that's why there is an airplane over there .
and that .
and he's pretending like this is that .
and he's pretending like he's soaring through the fields driving it .
do you want to be a pilot one day or no ?
no .
okay .
it's the wind .
because i feel like a pilot is like .
if you .
if the plane crashes .
and your it's your fault .
then you have like millions of like a bunch of people who died in the plane crash .
you have to blame yourself for that .
and it would be a lot of pressure .
and if it crashes because i know plane crashes happen sometimes .
you would most likely die .
so i probably would want to have a safer job .
that's fair .
that's sad to think about .
but .
you gotta think about the meh minor details that you might not think about .
but you just have to think about what is the danger level of this .
do you know what you might want to be or not yet ?
i think maybe an actress or a teacher .
oo .
or maybe a zookeeper .
pretty cool .
awesome .
so the room looks kind of messy or clean ?
messy because he's trying to see go through all of his stuff .
trying to find all the clothes that he's wearing .
and trying to find all the paper to make paper airplanes .
does your room ever look like that ?
yes .
are you good at cleaning or ?
what would you do that would be more organized you think ?
i'm not .
i don't really like organizing .
but it would make it a little bit easier .
but i can just find things out of the spot .
because i only have like a few stuff .
sometimes i have to dig for like old stuff .
that i don't use anymore .
and recently .
like a couple weeks ago .
we went through our rooms and our basement and donated a lot of stuff .
that's so nice .
that's awesome .
well you did a great job explaining this .
i have one shelf .
that is crowded with books .
what type of ?
you you say you like historical fiction ?
so what types of books do you have there ?
a lot of world war two books .
and a bunch of series books that i collected that i'm probably going to give to my little sister .
because she it's about her reading level now .
to .
i would give them to her when she's at my .
when i started reading those books .
so when she starts getting in fourth grade .
because there's some stuff that she may not be able to handle now .
because there's big words .
that she needs to learn still .
that's very nice of you to share your books .
with her .
awesome !
you're doing great !
thank you .
alright are you ready for the next picture ?
yup .
alright thanks jibo .
so what do you think is here ?
okay .
this girl is a scientist .
and dreaming about doing experiments .
she's basically a living cosi .
so and there's a big octopus in the background .
probably her imagination .
because i don't think that would possibly be happening .
in a like a school lab .
or maybe her house .
and she's has ideas .
she has a bunch of stuff on her wall to help her .
and she has a notepad .
she has a lab coat .
she has a rat .
at the bottom .
she's got a bunch of the experiment bottles .
two rats .
a bunch of books .
a bunch of jars .
with a bunch of stuff in it .
and a lot of posters to help her .
like this the d n a poster .
and then this .
about probably about molecoo molecules .
i don't know .
sorry .
mol .
molecules .
all good .
i understand what you mean .
anything else you see there ?
i think you got most of it .
so if you could have any pets or animals to help you out in a lab what would you like to have ?
what ?
i don't really understand that question .
like to experiment on ?
no to help you out .
to be your friends in the lab .
to help you do your experiment .
kind of like how this octopus seems to be helping her out .
i know dogs can be trained to help .
some dogs can open a fridge .
so probably like a german shepherd or a golden retriever .
because they can do a bunch of simple tasks when i'm busy experimenting .
awesome !
love that .
so what do you think they're doing there ?
like what type of experiment are they doing ?
probably trying to do a chemical reaction .
because there's a bunch of stuff in those .
or probably trying to figure out d n a of certain animals .
what type of stuff do you do in your science class ?
anything similar ?
well this year we just .
our homeroom class was just all of our classes .
we did .
i kind of forget because this was a while ago .
we did a roller coaster experiment .
where you had to build a roller coaster out of a bunch of stuff .
and it was energy .
and motion .
and we learned how to make a light turn on with a battery and a wire .
and the rollercoaster you had to build one .
and you had to have friction .
you had to have motion .
it's .
i forget all the stuff .
but you had to build a roller coaster .
and you had to make a marble go down .
and i remember my group .
we built a popsicle stick bridge .
and then we had a toilet paper roll .
like curved up to add the friction .
awesome .
to stop it .
that is so cool !
i wish i could do that .
alright anything else about this one ?
i don't really think so .
okay .
so we can probably go to the next one jibo .
alright .
this this girl loves gardening .
she's growing a beet .
bigger than her head .
she probably lives on a farm .
there's a snail .
there's a bunch of little beets .
what ?
what is that ?
a big snail ?
that's a huge snail .
more snails .
a lot of beets .
that she's growing .
and that's probably going to be a world record .
one that she's been trying to make create .
she's probably been growing it for like five years .
and i don't know what's in the background there .
it looks like it's breaking .
and there's a big fence around it .
and i .
that's what i see .
i don't know what the stuff in the background .
that stuff is back there .
i don't know either .
but i think you had good ideas about it .
so if you could have anything .
grow anything for a world record .
what would you want to grow ?
biggest doughnut .
biggest doughnut ?
what kinds of doughnuts do you like ?
i like doughnuts .
all doughnuts ?
i don't really like jelly filled doughnuts .
i like the long john ones .
because they're cream filled .
and they're and they're still a doughnut .
you get more doughnut than a regular glazed one .
so if your mom says one doughnut .
you only get to pick out one doughnut .
pick out a long john !
because it will give you more .
then it would a regular one .
and it's still one doughnut .
very true .
very smart .
love that .
so you kind of said what you already saw there .
but what do you think like ?
so you said she is going to make a new world record .
probably .
but .
because it's huge .
after that what do you think she'll do with it ?
she'd probably buy the book that she's in and just admire herself .
say .
i grew that beet .
and she'd probably try to grow a lot more of stuff .
and probably try to grow .
since she lives on a farm .
grow different things that her farm grows .
like soy beans .
or corn .
so she probably try to do that as a world record .
knowing that she has done it before .
because it gives you the motivation .
like i can do this again .
i've done it .
yep .
very cool .
anything else about this one ?
i don't think so .
alright .
good job !
thank you jibo for helping us .
great job !
awesome .
you can go ahead and hit a buzzer now .
that was so great .
i love hearing all your ideas .
alright now we're going to do something else .
and for this one if you could please tell me what you see this person doing .
and then how would you do that ?
what steps would you take ?
this little boy's brushing his teeth .
and i have braces .
so i have to brush the bottom .
brush underneath the bracket .
over the bracket .
un behind the teeth .
and then around .
so that's how i would do it .
oo .
so how ?
what would you do with the brush or ?
i would put my toothpaste on the brush .
and then i would start with the bottom teeth .
then the whole process .
and then i would turn on the water .
and spit it out .
sounds good to me .
and wash off my toothbrush .
so that way there is no toothpaste on it .
that would be kind of yucky .
alright what about here ?
this little boy is washing his hands .
and i turn on the water .
i get my hands wet .
i get the soap .
and then i wah .
and then i scrub it in .
and then i do the water .
and then i turn it off .
awesome .
he's tying his shoes .
i don't have tie able shoes on right now .
but i .
cross it .
it's kinda .
it's hard to explain unless i had tie able shoes .
you can just try your best .
all good .
so you put it in .
you ss .
you you have the two strands .
you put one over .
you put it through .
and then you tie it .
you don't tie it yet .
then you make a bunny ear .
and you wrap one around .
you pull it through .
and then you double .
and then i have to double knot it .
sometimes i don't double knot it .
and then it looks like two bunny ears with like strand sticking out .
you did a great job explaining that .
it's it's very hard to explain .
so it might not be a perfect picture .
but it's a semi complete picture .
no .
no .
i had a beautiful visual of that .
thank you .
thank you .
alright what's up here ?
this girl is pouring herself cereal .
except she has probably like milk .
even though she has milk .
or she's got to pour it in .
because at first i pour in the cereal .
in my bowl .
which i have to get out the bowl .
i pour in my cereal .
i pour in the milk .
i get the spoon .
and then i bring it to the table .
and eat breakfast .
nice .
or dinner .
breakfast or dinner .
what type of cereal do you like ?
i like fruit loops .
do you have cereal often ?
usually when we we're going to school .
we either have like a granola bar or cereal .
what about this one ?
this boy is putting on a sweatshirt .
and it's kind of hard to explain .
you can try your best .
but first i take the sweatshirt .
i put my head under it .
i put my arms through .
and then i pull .
and then i puh .
and then .
okay .
i put it over my head .
my head is out .
and then i put my right arm .
and then my left arm .
because my right arm is my good arm .
nice .
awesome !
what days would you probably want to wear a sweatshirt ?
in winter .
or like if i'm cold .
sounds good !
what else would you wear in the winter ?
pants .
and boots .
and long sleeve shirts .
awesome .
what about this one ?
she is frosting cupcakes .
i usually .
we don't we don't really make cupcakes .
but i would probably do it the way she's doing it .
how's she doing it ?
she has the plain cupcake .
and she has the frosting .
and then she's swirling it around .
going in before .
and like making like a big like taller and taller loop .
until she gets to the top .
what might you put on top ?
after that ?
sprinkles .
sprinkles ?
that sounds .
or just eat it plain frosting .
good stuff .
good stuff .
what about this one ?
this girl is painting a picture .
i have acrylic paint .
so i would get my canvas on my easel .
i pick out my paint that i want on my palette .
i would get my brush .
put it in .
and then i would just start painting .
and then i would put it in the water .
and then dry it off on my paper towel .
awesome !
and i know you said you like to paint eyes ?
do you paint anything else ?
i don't paint .
i draw eyes .
but i paint .
i just paint kind of abstract i think .
and do a bunch of shapes .
i know i made a dripping one once .
and it looks really cool .
very cool .
i made a sunset .
and a cool sh shape one at my friends house .
that was before i got acrylic paint .
very cool .
any other crafts you do ?
i don't really know .
that's okay !
it's been a while .
all good .
alright what's happening here ?
this boy is fastening his seat belt .
so i pull down my seat belt .
like like this .
and bring it over .
like diagonal .
because usually it would just go like this .
and then i'd buckle it in .
and then i just like tighten it if i needed to .
nice .
what about here ?
this girl is pretending to feed her sick teddy bear soup .
and i would just pretend pick up stuff from the bowl .
and just put it by it's mouth .
like she's doing .
alright .
wait so here what do you think this person is doing ?
he is having a costume party .
but he didn't know what to wear .
so he just went with all of them .
so what is he wearing ?
he's wearing a tutu .
a suit .
beautiful scarf .
fairy wand .
and then sunglasses .
and a witch hat .
do you dress up like this ever ?
sometimes when i'm messing around with my sisters .
that's fun .
what's happening here ?
this boy is going down the slide .
and i would do the exact same thing he did .
because it's kind of the only way to go down a slide .
unless you went head first .
which i sometimes do .
what would you do maybe before you get on the slide ?
i would climb up the ladder .
put my feet down first .
and then just slide down .
okay awesome .
what's happening here ?
this boy is playing soccer .
and i would kick the ball .
pass it to my teammate .
and then like go by the goal .
because i play soccer .
you do ?
what position ?
we kind of switch positions .
but i usually play off .
i play all the positions .
because i don't .
i use .
i sometimes play offense .
i usually play goalie in the games .
at least one quart .
at least one session of it .
defense .
and then mid .
which is like in between offense and defense .
and it's offense offense and defense .
so if you have the ball you can just score a goal .
but if offense is on the other side of the field you kind of want to be in between offense and defense .
gotcha .
very cool .
have you been playing for a long time ?
no .
i played when i was like three .
but i have .
i started this year in the spring .
again .
and i'm going to do it in the fall .
awesome !
well i hope you have fun !
these people are building blocks .
and they spelled blue .
and then z q s .
which is not a word .
but they spelled blue with letter blocks .
and then i would probably spell like words .
like weird words .
probably like glue .
or goo .
what about this one ?
this boy is pushing the girl on the swing .
but i would not recommend what he's doing .
because he is flipping the swing like this .
and she's just like falling off of it .
but holding on .
so how would you do it then ?
they would be sitting on a swing .
and i would just like push their back .
not push the string .
because that would make them slow down more .
good idea .
awesome !
what's happening here ?
this .
some .
either this girl is giving her a lollipop .
or this girl is giving her a lollipop .
and it's kind of hard to tell .
i think this girl is receiving the lollipop !
because she wrapped it around .
no this girl is receiving it .
because this girl has candy already .
do you ever do this ?
not with my sisters .
that's funny .
do you like candy ?
yes .
oo what types ?
i can't really have that much .
but i make exceptions for gummies by ripping them up into little pieces .
and then just sucking on them .
nice .
good .
what's this happening here ?
this boy is in time out .
and he looks like he probably does baseball .
so he probably was swinging and hit the window .
so he has to wait for the timer to go off .
how long do you think he's going to wait ?
thirty minutes .
that's a reasonable guess .
and then probably be grounded .
because he doesn't .
have you experienced this before ?
i've been in the corner before .
but like it was only for like a minute .
okay .
cool .
cool .
cool .
you're all good with that .
you can go ahead and hit a buzzer .
and then we'll look at a few pictures .
you're doing an awesome job !
thanks .
we'll look at a few of these fun pictures .
and then be all done okay ?
cool .
okay .
so this one's kind of cool .
i think you'll like this one .
so what do you think is happening here ?
what do you see ?
this little girl is either in space .
no she's not in space because she can't bring a book .
i don't think .
into space .
but she and these planets aren't that close together .
she's pretend .
there's not two saturns .
and she's pretending like she's in space .
and she's wearing probably an astronaut costume .
because she wants to be an astronaut .
and she's .
and this is her imagination .
and this is what she sees in her imagination .
very cool .
would you ever go in space ?
probably not .
why ?
because i know that a lot of spaceships have crashed .
and i would probably be away from my family for a while .
that's a good reason .
i like this one .
that's cute .
so what do you see ?
i see a frog wearing a crown .
a king frog .
and a mug .
how do you think that happened ?
he just hopped into the mug .
because frog can do that .
and he's cute .

there's a bunch of there's a bunch of like chemicals in jars and stuff .
think that's a trash can i see .
over by the rat .
there's a couple rats .
there's a couple books .
and i think the octopus is also holding a magnifying glass and another chart .
so maybe .
do you think the octopus is like helping out in the lab .
cool .
do you think the kid knows the octopus is there ?
probably .
okay .
alright .
anything else about this picture ?
no .
i don't see anything else .
alright .
then we can go on to the next one .
look at the picture .
i believe it's our last picture .
what is this ?
alright .
so what do you see here ?
think that's a kid .

where'd the picture go to now .
i'm on linux .
no .
sometimes jibo likes to play games and mess around with us .
it does it very often .
jibo !
okay .
it's back .
okay .
i think that's a kid with a giant radish .
and i think i see a bunch of radishes planted .
i think the kid has has family or something .
owns a farm .
and one of the things they make is radishes .
i also see it looks like a pretty big snail .
i see a shovel .
another snail .
kid's in a farmer's outfit .
have you ever ?
have you ever been on a farm ?
i think so .
if you could plant anything if you were to have a farm what would you want to plant ?
probably .
i'm not really sure .
probably .
probably lettuce .
any fruits ?
probably .
not sure .
maybe like an apple tree or two .
that'd be nice .
but lettuce would be mainly for my hamster .
gotta think about the pets .
i like that attitude .
the pets .
awesome !
so the big rabbit's there .
what do you think she's going to do with it ?
probably put in make use it to make another food a another food .
and have like dinner or something .
so does it look like she's working on the farm ?
or that's her farm ?
what do you think ?
think she's just working .
i think her parents or something own the farm .
okay .
she's just helping out .
that's nice of her .
so you said you noticed some snails there right ?
what do you think they're doing there ?
i think it's like their natural habitat .
like they lived there when the farm was made so they just they just stayed there .
and sometime .
and like they just go around doing pretty much nothing .
yep .
maybe they're just helping or something .

thank you .
my favorite color is blue .

that's so cool !
it's so cute .
alrighty, let's get started .
so what are we doing ?
today, we're going to do an activity together .
i'm going to show you some pictures .
and you're going to tell me about them .
what is this ?
what, ?
jibo, we need the picture buddy .
i need the picture .
awesome, okay .
what do you see there ?
i see a little boy .
fish .
a lion .
dragonflies .
i see a boat .
i see lily pads .
i see hills in the background .
i see grass .
i think i see flowers .
i see the water .
that's all i see .
awesome !
so, what do you think the boy and the lion are doing ?
they're on a boat looking at the fish .
yep .
how did they get there ?
i have no .
maybe by .
maybe the little boy rode the lion to get over there .
so how do ?
do you think they're friends or what are they ?
i think they're probably friends .
okay, so this is a friendly lion ?
would you be friends with a lion ?
as long as it was nice and .
okay .
wouldn't eat me .
what would you do with a lion if you were friends with one ?
i would probably keep it a secret from my family .
maybe they'd want to be friends with it too !
well, i don't know .
maybe the lion will be friendly to them .
okay .
so where do you think they're going ?
maybe they're trying to ride the boat out to the ocean, maybe .
and where do you think they're going to go from the ocean ?
maybe go to a different place, like another island or something .
that's a great guess .
so where are they here ?
i think they're in like a pond or a lake .
have you been on a pond or a lake before ?
well our grandpa has two lakes, well ponds, in his backyard .
so i go there .
but in one of them there is a bunch of frogs .
and in the second one there are baby snapping turtles .
turtles and snapping ones ?
it's .
so when you go there, what do you normally do then ?
i normally go to the pond with all the frogs .
and i scare the frogs .
because i love to hear them like croak and like scream .
and .
who do you ?
it's fun .
go with ?
i normally go with my sister .
and we just go over there .
we grab a stick .
and we run the stick over the tall grass and cattails to scare the frogs .
and does it work ?
yes it does .
one time we actually caught a frog but we had to let it gg .
but then it jumped out of our hands because it was so slippery .
what, what was it like, holding it ?
it was like slimey .
never held a frog before so .
i've held a .
i caught a tadpole once .
what, what was that like ?
it was kind of hard actually to be honest .
anything else at the pond that you see ?
we see a lot of fish with the pond that has the snapping turtles in it .
we see a whole bunch of like little black figures .
and we're .
and then .
and we go out sometimes with our gran, with our grandpa and we feed the fish .
that's nice .
how ?
what are the fish like ?
how big are they ?
they're actually pretty small .
they're maybe about like this big .
okay .
they're not that big .
okay that's cool .
well i'm glad you all get to do that together .
yeh .
anything else you do ?
we played a lot of .
we play a lot of board games and card games .
like what ?
we play .
we play uno .
and i .
we sometimes .
i watch the grownups play rummy cube .
because they love to play that like pretty much every time we go there .
you're the one who always suggests it .
or it's our grandma .
so i'm .
i'm guessing you don't like the game they play .
i, i'm not sure what game it is but .
it's actually kind .
it's actually pretty fun .
okay .
what ?
what is the game ?
i don't know it .
it's kind of hard to explain .
is it similar to uno or ?
no .
not really .
so in the first round you have to have .
so each of these little like dominoes blocks has like one number on them .
and it goes up to thirteen .
and then on some of them, there's a little face .
and that could be any number you want .
and so in the first round you have to have , three numbers that add up to thirty or more .
correct ?
it's thirty or more ?
okay .
and then in the second round you just need to put out ones that would match .
like that would go like one, two, three and so on .
and so that's pretty much the game .
until you get rid of all of your little pieces .
and if you don't have something to make, then you grab one extra .
very cool .
i'll have to play it sometime .
i've never .
it's a lot of fun .
so you do like it ?
yes .
okay that's funny .
anything else you all do together ?
we'll watch movies .
what type ?
and sometimes .
sorry .
everything except scary movies .
okay .
me too .
and we have something called camp grandma .
and sometimes she'll let us stay up past our bedtime .
that's nice .
but that's only sometimes .
and we're going to go to her house .
for camp grandma .
awesome that's .
soon .
so fun .
soon ?
when i .
when our parents go to atlanta !
do you want to go to atlanta too ?
yes .
maybe when you're bigger you'll go there .
maybe .
awesome !

he's probably pretending to be like an explorer .

what do you like to do ?
i like to hah, put my stuffed animals in random spots in my room and pretend like i'm finding a lot of rare creatures .
very cool !
what type of creatures ?
creatures that aren't even real .
okay .
creatures that aren't actually a thing .
i just make it up .
as i go .
that's fun though, right ?
awesome !
so do you think this person ?
what do they want to be when they grow up you think ?
he could also be pretending that he's a pilot .
so maybe a pilot, an explorer, .
do you know what you want to be .
something like that .
when you grow up ?
not yet .
not yet ?
i've had a lot of different ideas .
and you know, you don't need to know yet .
no .
so that's totally fine .
so on a scale of one to ten, how messy would you rate that room ?
maybe about seven point five, seven and a half .
my room's gotten messier .
really ?
our basement's gotten messier .
so if you rated your room and your basement, what would you rate them ?
over ten .
well like both of them combined together over ten .

you can make it up .

they're going to another galaxy .

, that's fun !
do you think these fishes are going with them ?
no .
no ?
they're probably going to run away .
what else do you see ?
i see , a .
is that a dragon fly ?
and i see flowers .
and i see .
and then thei , their lily pads .
and the boy has a rain coat on .
and these are more flowers .
and , i think that's , there's some small grass over in this area .
and there's a lot of fish .
a lot of fish ?
have you been on a boat before ?
how'd you like it ?
it was fun .
what did you do ?
we went on a cruise boat .
oo .
let's see what's here .
that looks like a boy version of amelia earhart .
tell me more .
what is she doing ?
so .
he's throwing paper airplanes .
it looks he's trying to throw them .
out the window .
or something .
and i guess .
he's hoping to make .
to be an avaviator .
when he grows up .
and he has goggles .
he he has a costume on .
he's prepared to go on .
ride in a plane .
and he is .
he's , i think he's dreaming .
up here .
he's dreaming .
that he's a .
he's sorta like a famous engineer .
or something that .
and he flies planes .
and he's like throwing this paper airplane .
and as you can see .
it , it goes over there .
and it probably just goes somewhere else .
and he has a fish .
and he also has a really messy bedroom that his mother is probably going to yell at him for .
what makes it messy ?
because he stacked all his pillows on his bed .
he left out a stinky gym sock .
he has two toy cars .
and a pillow on the ground .
he's got stuff hanging out of his closet that he needs to put away .
i think he is very messy .
i think i have to agree with you .
does your room look like that ?
what's going on in this picture ?
it's a little .
it's a little girl who .
i think she wants to be a scientist .
she's dreaming about the stuff .
she she has an octopus .
and she's in a science lab .
and the octopus has a pencil .
and a note a notebook .
he has a .
she's holding a light bulb which stands for ideas .
and she needs to clean up this place too because there's rats .
what do you think he's trying to say ?
she's probably trying to study .
science .
and my .
maybe do an experiment .
that's a good way to look at it .
what do you think the octopus is there for ?
maybe an assistant .
would you like an octopus assistant ?
he can do many things at once .
what's going on here ?
there's a girl .
and she just .
and she looks like a farmer .
and she just pulled out an enormous tulip .
or is that a radish ?
i don't know .
and .
that can be whatever you want it to be .
and she has to clean the garden because there are snails everywhere !
there's a lot of snails .
and they're going to destroy her garden .
no .
what do you think she's trying to do with this ?
she might .
she's g .
maybe she'll make a stew .
oo .
or maybe she can make a tulip .
i mean .
radish bread .
or she could throw it away .
she could leave it in compost .
so she could make more soil .
she could give it to someone poor .
so they can eat that .
and .
and .
move on .
kuh and they haven't .
and get .
give them giving them enough food .
and .
maybe she's .
she could like , she could cut it up .
put it in a drawer .
and use it for salad .
or something like that .
she could paint it .
and use it for decoration until it rots .
she could feed it to animals .
maybe she has a pet .
or a deer .
or something .
like an animal .
maybe she can feed it to horses because she lives on a farm .
and maybe .
shshe could give it to someone .
and just let them keep it for no reason .
she could be a worker .
and have to and be harvesting stuff .
for a someone .
maybe a owner of the farm .
i actually think it's big enough you can do all of those things .
right ?

alright .

peanuts are a healthy snack .
peanuts grow on plants .
the peanut is not a nut .
it is really a bean .
the plants grow to be one foot tall .
that is the same length as a ruler .
the plant has leaves and flowers .
the flowers are red with yellow .
the flower pushes under the ground to grow a pod .
the pod is also a shell .
the peanuts grow inside the pod .
the pod is under the ground .
the peanut pods are one to three inches long .
to eat the peanuts crack open the pod .
inside the pod will be one to four peanuts each .
the peanut you can eat is really the seed .

one .
and then now tell me what you think is going to come after it .
and it might, we might trip you up .
so get ready for some patterns .

my goodness .
alright .
alright this one .
i want you to tell me everything you see in the picture .
and then tell me a story about it .
just use your imagination .
i know you've got a good one based on the .
i see two fish .
a kid and a lion in a boat .
and a dragon fly .
and some lily pads .
and land, plants, and water .
alright .
can you tell me any ?
even if you made up an imaginary, with your imagination, a story about how they got here or what they're doing ?
so there's a giant flood in the boy's town .
and the lion was stuck .
so the boy saved the lion .
and there's giant mutant fish in the water .
and they couldn't get back on land .
because there's plaplants surrounding it .
and there's moldy lily pads .
and that's all i have .
awesome .
well so what happened at the end ?
did they get out ?
the boat got too wet .
and it molded .
and they sank .
my goodness .
but the boy could swim but the lion couldn't .
okay .
and then what happened ?
the lion died .
i told you to use your imagination .
that was awesome .
anything else you want to say about this picture ?
there's a giant killer dragon fly in the scare, in the sky .
killer dragon flies too ?
well i asked to get inside your brain .
and i did .
same thing with this one .
tell me everything you see first .
i see the same boy at his house .
playing with cars and planes in his room .
with planes or pillows all on his bed .
and i see a tiny mutant fish in the fish bowl .
they're back .
and there's planes in the sky .
and clouds .
and dirty socks .
and his bed .
that's all i have .
alright .
so can you tell me a continuation of this story since i think this is now the sequel ?
the kid was trying to ride on his plane .
his paper airplane but he couldn't .
so he threw trucks on the floor .
and his dirty socks .
and he got on pillows .
and the mutant fish was in the water so he got too big .
and the water went everywhere .
and it started the whole flood .
and the kid .
this is the prequel .
and the kid ended up in the boat with the lion again .
alright .
can you explain this to me ?
why are there clouds in his room ?
because he's imagining .
perfect .
anything else about this picture ?
the same thing happened in the first story .
all over again .
one tear .
okay .
now i know this might be a different story .
so let, well let's see what your brain comes up with .
but tell me everything you see first .
and let me know what you know .
there's a girl with giant rats .
and a squid not in the water .
which could die .
and she's trying to do science .
and she might be at cosi .
maybe, maybe behind the scenes ?
she might try to kill everybody with her experiment .
but that's all i have .
on purpose ?
yes .
so what, what tools would she use ?
can you tell me anything about these ?
do you know anything about any of these tools ?
a notebook, a pencil, a magnifying glass .
rats for experiments .
glass jars .
so what kind of experiment would she be doing ?
because i know you and your sister talked about being scientists so .
what, what would she be looking at ?
elephant tooth paste .
you know what ?
i'll i'll give you that bud .
anything else you want to tell me about this scientist ?
she's looking at the light bulb .
yep .
what does that mean ?
he might be trying to make the light bulb brighter .
okay .
alright .
last one here .
same thing .
there's a tiny girl holding a big radish .
with giant snails .
on a tiny farm .
with a shovel .
and other plants .
and that's all i see .
you got one more story in you ?
the girl picked up a giant radish .
and she's trying to feed it to the big snails .
and then when she did, they'd get all fat .
she's going to take her shovel .
and then chop them up .
and eat them .
my goodness !
so you think snails are, would be good food ?
no .
so then why would she chop them up ?
because she likes snails .
fair enough .
because she's the farmer .
she bought the farm or did someone give it to her ?
she bought the farm .
alright .
anything else about this picture before we're done ?
there's dirt everywhere .
what'd you say ?
there's dirt everywhere .
there's dirt on the snails too .
makes sense .
we're outside .
you delivered with your stories .
thank you so much .
go ahead .
and hit two buzzers for that one .

and if you want to double knot it, you cross it over and put it through again .
perfect .
gave us all the options .
this person's pouring cereal in the bowl .
so you put cereal in the bowl .
then you put milk .
and then you eat it .
this person's putting a sweater on .
so first you put it over your head .
and then you put it on the rest of your body .
and you put your arms through .
this person's putting icing on cupcakes .
so first you get the cupcake .
and then you squeeze it on the cupcake .
and then you eat it .
this person's painting .
so first you get paint .
then you put it on the brush .
and then you put it on the paper .
this person's sitting down in the car .
so first you sit down .
then you put your seat belt on .
and this person's feeding their teddy bear .
which you shouldn't do that .
so first you get the ss you get the food on the spoon .
then you put it on the teddy bear .
that makes sense .
you don't have to tell me how to do anything anymore .
just tell me what you're doing .
and what you would do if you were that person .
would you do the same thing ?
would you do something different ?
that person's playing dress up .
and i would put on a spongebob costume .
a what costume ?
a spongebob costume .
you like spongebob ?
would you ?
did you see if he has movies too just like, in addition to the tv show ?
but i can't watch it because i, because we don't have paramount plus .
we only have amazon prime .
maybe soon .
they're on a slide .
i would rather swing and jump off .
how high are you able to jump off ?
as high as i can before i do an under dog .
this person's playing soccer .
i would play baseball instead of soccer .
do you play baseball all year round or just during some of the seasons ?
i play spring and summer .
and i sometimes play in the fall .
but i normally play soccer in the fall .
what position do you play ?
second base and pitcher .
ththey are playing with blocks .
but i would rather play with legos .
because they, you can build more stuff with it or ?
you can build more stuff .
this person's swinging and pushing them .
i would rather just pump my legs back and forth .
you're .
this kiddo's younger .
these people are trading candy .
i would rather not because it's during covid .
and you don't know if they already licked it .
you know what ?
that's smart .
this person's in time out .
i would normally get grounded instead .
alright .
hit a buzzer for me .
we're onto our last game .
so i'm just going to show you my favorite pictures .
because i think some of them are pretty silly .
okay .
and i want you to .
because of your imagination, i want you to tell me what you think the story , is happening .
okay ?
they're in space .
and they're, they are catching fireflies .
which you can't do that in space .
because they would already be dead .
you know, you know why people can't survive in space ?
well people can survive but fireflies can't .
and why do you have an air tube that's like that's like two hundred feet long ?
no you're exactly right .
we made these to kinda be silly to make you go that's out of place .
so you found the things that were out of place .
right ?
alright let me see some of my favorite ones i want to show you .
why is there a frog in a cup ?
i thought it was so cute !
what else does he have on him ?
is he drih ?
he's a king .
and he's drinking coffee like while he's in the mug .
that's as good a guess as any .
i like that .
the pig obobviously made the water brown already .
because they're always dirty .
and how would he be able to play in a boat ?
and he's like twice the size of that bath tub .
well .
how would he be able to fit in that ?
i'm surprised the water's not overflowing more .
makes sense .
and there's no way to put in water .
it's just a tub in the middle of nowhere .
i didn't notice that either .
but that is true .
okay last one .
there's a polar bear selling potatos .
for seventy five cents .
that's too cheap and .

that one's .
he he he .
i like that one .
it's different ones each time .
alright .
for this one, jibo's going to tell us what to do .
okay ?
today, we're going to do an activity together .
i'm going to show you some pictures .
and you're going to tell me about them .
sounds good .
okay .
what is this ?
i think he's going to show us .
there it is .
can you tell me what you see ?
a boy in a boat .
with a lion in the boat with him .
and two fish .
and something in the corner .
behind the lion .
look really close .
there anything detailed you see ?
what are all the little stuff in there ?
grass, flowers, dragonfly, , lily pads, shell .
seashells i think ?
and .
i think i see lillies .
nice .
so, tell me a story about this .
how do you think they got there ?
haha .
i have no idea .
i think .
i think it's definitely fiction because a lion never befriends a boy .
unless it was born with the boy .
that's true .
so, .
use your imagination .
i .
tell me what you think happened .
like, people took a baby boy and a baby lion cub and put them together .
ha ha ha .
and then they're on a boat .
that makes a lot of sense .
looking at fish .
where are they going ?
i don't know .
maybe just, like .
i, i think they're just exploring .
because it looks like they're exploring the lake .
anything else you see there ?
i think there's rocks in the distance .
or, like, huge dragonfly wings .
haha, .
interesting .
anything else ?
not really .
alright .
jibo, i think we're done with that picture .
can you show us another one ?
what is this ?
a dude pretending to be a .
like superman on a bed .
which he forgot to clean up .
no .
a pilot .
he's pretending to be a pilot .
shooting airplanes around in his messy room when he was supposed to be cleaning it .
that's, haha, makes sense .
haha .
can you tell me all that you see in there ?
i think that's some books .
something .
like socks .
his dresser has, .
like something hanging out .
and, like, i think fake clouds .
i don't know .
and i think a bedsheet or something .
over the ceiling .
toy cars on the floor .
sssock where it shouldn't be on the floor .
a pillow, a pillowcase .
his bed's unmade .
and his window is halfway open .
good description .
so you said he's pretending to be .
a pilot .
how can you tell ?
bless you .
i can tell by , the hat and goggles .
and some of the outfit .
what's going on at the top of the screen ?
what's that all over ?
it, it .
it looks like two, .
a two sky with a plane .
bless you .
alright, cool .
anything else you want to tell me about this picture ?
nothing except the boy should be cleaning his room .
why ?
what is this ?
what is this ?
no .
let's see what pops up .
haha .
a dude experimenting and .
with an octopus thing reading a book .
and a science lab .
and a dude .
with a .
and a dude has bushy hair with a lightbulb in his hand .
book under arm .
and .
he's running somewhere .
with goggles .
and the octopus squid thing .
just looking at him like, what now ?
good description .
what, .
i see a rat .
that too .
two rats .
books .
what are they doing there ?
i don't know .
maybe they're pretending to be dead .
so that they can go and devour some stuff .
maybe that's cheese .
so what kind of science do you think they do there ?
just experiment on animals .
so what, what do you think the octopus is ?
like, is he, like an experiment ?
is he there to help ?
what are you thinking ?
haha .
i, i have no idea .
take a guess .
make a guess .
i guess that they captured him in the wild and forced .
and he just became a scientist or something .
anything else you see here ?
the clock thing in the corner .
what is it ?
that .
what .
it's strange cause she's holding on to, like, a magnifying glass .
but it also is .
it looks like it's part of the thing there .
so it looks like the d n a thing .
makes sense .
anything else ?
nothing except why that's there .
cool .
hah .
alright, jibo .
you can show us another one .
what is this ?
giant thing .
i forgot what it's called .
with slugs in her garden and weeds and stuff .
and a fence in the background .
this time it's an actual open sky .
not like the dude and his .
he was supposed to be cleaning up his room .
with an imaginary sky .
awesome .
what kind of place is this ?
i think it's like a garden .
farm or something .
haha .
is it .
it's a .
what's .
although i don't know how they grew so big .
do you think this is real life ?
do you think you could find a farm like this ?
no .
no .
why not ?
because, , i don't know anything that could grow that big .
and, , i'm sure the turnip has leaves on it .
have you seen a snail before ?
not one with his shell .
i've seen, ones .
like, ones that look like this without shells .
but never ones with shells .
why do you think there's so many of them ?
i have no idea .
anything else you see on this picture ?
a shovel .
what's the shovel for ?
digging up the plants .
cool .
anything else ?
why does he have the hu .
the biggest turnip in the world ?
haha .
that is a good question .
i don't know .
and does the next one have a dog ?
that, that'd be strange .
haha .
thanks jibo .
that was cool .
you're doing great .
haha .
go ahead and hit a buzzer for me .
alright .
go ahead and read me this page .
okay ?
the sweet potato is a root vegetable, so that means it grows under the ground .
sweet potatos are large and sweet .
sweet potatos are long .
the skin of the sweet potato can be yellow, orange, red, brown, purple , or tan .
on the inside, the sweet potato can be tan, white, red, pink, purple, yellow, or orange .
if the sweet potato is white or pale or yellow, it is not very sweet .
the sweet potato will taste sweeter if it is red, pink, or orange .
there are many ways to cook a sweet potato .
you can bake it in the oven .
you can make sweet potato fries .
you can even make sweet potato pie .
i do not think that's real .
haha .
alright .
cause it can be tan on the outside .
that's true .
and the inside .
that's true .
alright, go ahead and read this one .

cam visited the water park with his uncle moe .
cam was running around with his squishy shoes .
a boy who was bigger than cam asked, why do you have your shoes on ?
cam looked down at his feet and shrugged .
why not ?
cam told him .
they both started to laugh .
come on, said the boy .
the boy started to run and cam could barely keep up .
they ran in zig-zags to avoid the tall water .
they jumped over the short water .
the boy found his friends and they all started playing a game of tag .
cam didn't see the girl on the other side of the tall water .
the girl didn't see cam either .
cam was running as fast as he could and pow !
they both fell hard .
cam's arm was bleeding and his eyes were stinging .
he stood up and helped the girl get up .
you okay ?
cam whispered .
i am sorry .
i did not see you there .
well you should walk !
yelled the girl's mom, who came to help .
to help the girl back to her towel .
cam felt sad that the girl was hurt .
then he realized that he didn't even know where his uncle moe .
hh, where his uncle moe was .
now cam's eyes were leaking water .
he was glad he was all wet so no one could see his tears .
how could such a great day turn so bad ?
cam counted .
closed his eyes and counted to ten .
he lifted his chin up and tried to find his towel .
maybe uncle .
maybe uncle moe would be near the towel waiting for him .
do you want to read this last one ?
or do you want to move on ?
i'll read this last one .
okay .
a garden is a place where people grow food or flowers .
gardens can be big or small .
gardens can be in the ground or they can be in a small pot .
gardens can be at home or in church .
some kids have gardens at their .
at their school .
there are gardens at the white house, the home of the president of the united states .
one garden grows food and the other garden is the rose garden .
you need four things to grow a garden .
a sunny spot, good soil, water, and time .
a sunny spot .
plants need sunshine to grow nice vegetables and flowers .
a spot that faces south is best .
good soil .
sssoil is a kind of dirt .
pile up the soil like a small hill so that the water can go down .
the pile of soil should be twenty inches .
or the size of ruler .
it's good for your plants if worms live in the soil .
to invite worms, cut up leaves three inches .
put cut up leaves three inches down in your soil .
water .
gardens do well if they get about one inch of rain each week .
if it's hot and dry outside, you need to give more water to your garden .
the best test is to put your finger in the soil .
if you get mud on your hands, it's too wet .
if the soil is dusty, the plant needs water .
time .
some plants grow in a few weeks .
others take a few months .
you must wait and take care of your plants .
then you can enjoy the food and flowers from your garden .
awesome job .
hit a buzzer for me .
we're going to do a few more of these .
and then you're all done .

i had to tie them when i got here .
a girl pouring cereal .
or something in a .
her bowl .
i don't do that .
my mom does it .
a dude putting a sweater on .

and , i always do the stuff that goes under first .
a person making cupcakes .
i do not know how to make cupcakes .
do you know how to ice cupcakes ?
and decorate them ?
i think .
can you tell me how to do that ?

purple .
purple yup .
isn't that your favorite color too ?
i love purple .
so .
in this task, i want you to tell me everything you see in the picture .
ooh .
and then if you can, maybe come up with a story on like what's going on or how they got there .
that's going to be kind of hard .
well you can be as creative as you want .
you can be as .
hmm well i didn't really see a lion .
a boy in a boat .
i see a few fish .
one's upside down .
i'm not sure if they're both upside down .
but .
and a few lilypads .
no, a fish tail right there which means there's probably another fish somewhere .
lots of flowers over here .
i don't know what that is .
maybe a bigger leaf ?
and i don't know what that is but .
and there's a dragonfly and another dragonfly .
some grass right here .
a big thing that might be a lily pad i don't know .
and .
i also see water .
water yup .
so if you have to come up with a story on what's going on, what would you say ?
and you can be as creative or as crazy as possible .
well here's what i think .
let me see .
so there was a boy and a lion .
and they met one day .
and the boy thought that the lion was going to eat him but the lion didn't .
and the lion just came closer to him and closer to him until it rode, until the lion rode on his back .
and and apparently, after that, he would see the lion every single day .
the lion would come up to him .
he would even be able to pet the lion .
and then one day they found a boat by the lake .
so they went on the boat and went exploring together .
and then they found a bunch of a big fish and stuff .
would you be friends with a lion ?
i love cats .
you love cats ?
do you have cats ?
i have one cat that's named princess truffle thunder kittie .
my god haha .
you like cats ?
do you want another cat ?
hmm maybe .
maybe ?
in the future ?
alright anything else you want to tell me about this picture ?
i don't know .
i don't know .
everything's very detailed .
i know .
these fish are so big too .
they're so big .
i know those are huge fishes .
aren't those almost as big as the boat ?
they're almost as big as the lion .
i know that's crazy .
imagine if you actually saw a fish like that, like that big .
i'd, that would be scary .
that would be really scary .
imagine how many teeth that thing would have .
hmm my god .
probably like a great white shark teeth .
alright let's move on to the next one .
you did so good on that one so i want you to do the same exact thing for this one .
how many, how many of these are there ?
there's only three more .
okay .
including this yup .
so two more after i finish this one .
well i see lots of .
i see some cars .
some airplanes .
some paper airplanes .
this guy looks like he's having fun pretending to be a pilot .
i see i see lots of pillows .
and i see a sock .
there's a bed you know .
he has a pet fish .
he does .
picture .
i don't know exactly what's on the picture though .
some clouds .
looks like some wind .
some nice breezes up ahead .
and a lamp .
some clothing out of the drawer it looks like .
some books and drawers .
and his bed .
and .
why do you think there's no ceiling but there's a window ?
hmm maybe he's using his imagination to pretend like there's not a ceiling .
so in the picture there's like .
that's a great guess .
no ceiling .
so if you have to come up with a story about this picture, what would you say ?
well i'd say that this little boy is very interested in planes and vehicles and stuff like that .
and i think when he grows up he wants to be a pilot so .
i believe that this is him imagining and pretending that he's in, on a mountain watching the planes fly by .
so .
do you ever do that ?
do you ever imagine anything ?
not really .
no not really .
what do you want to be when you grow up though ?
a zoo keeper or an astronaut .
my god .
have you seen the planetarium here ?
no .
no ?
you definitely should .
no .
planets and stuff .
but is there anything else you want to tell me about this picture ?
i don't know there's a pretty nice tree right there .
alright we can move on to the next one .
this is one of my favorites .
the, woah .
is her teacher an octopus ?
i guess .
alright octopus teacher which is kind of crazy .
looks like the teacher is teaching her a lot of things .
looks like she's carrying a lightbulb .
she has safety goggles on .
and well she has a pet rat .
she has another pet rat .
she has lots of books .
looks like they were testing chemicals .
and they have lots of jars over there .
some stuff over there .
lots of, ooh they have a little plant right here .
like a, i forget what you call that thing .
what thing ?
a microscope ?
yes .
well the teacher's holding up a pencil .
it looks like she's trying to sneak out of class but teacher's just like nope not going anywhere today .
cause look at that, look at that .
she's like where are you going ?
would you have an octopus teacher ?
isn't that so funny ?
no i don't have an octopus teacher .
anything else you want to say about this picture ?
i don't know .
it looks like the girl's pretty happy studying her lightbulb .
what do you think they're experimenting ?
this light bulb ?
maybe .
i have no idea .
fair enough .
probably something crazy .
i mean there is literally an octopus teacher so .
alright next picture, last one for this activity .
woah that's a big beet !
so there's a big ginormous beet .
there's a girl holding the beet .
that must, that beet must be heavy .
there's some other beets as you may see .
a big snail .
big, big snail .
that's like the biggest snail i've ever seen .
cause look how, look look at the size of that compared to that .
crazy .
that must be a very big snail .
i know .
well nice clouds, a sky .
there's huge leaves on this beet like .
those leaves are so big .
that's a big beet .
i wonder what the biggest beet in the world is .
let me see .
that one's almost as big as her so that's crazy .
it's taller than her .
how do you think it got so big ?
well maybe she had the right soil .
and like the right water and like .
maybe .
what about the other ones ?
they weren't that big .
well maybe she picked the other ones early .
cause maybe, maybe they could have grown more like that one but she just picked them .
ooh maybe have you ever planted anything ?
we have beets in our garden .
you do ?
hopefully they'll grow as big as that .
hopefully wouldn't that be crazy .
i want to see, i want to see a beet that big .
so what do you do with a beet that big ?
i don't know .
probably break a world record .
and then my parents will probably make something out of it .
like bake something .
that would last you like the whole year .
you'd just be eating beets for dinner everyday .
anything else you see ?
well, well, well .
i see a nice you know like a nice little like wooden fence .
looks like another snail over there .
and .
and a shovel .
and another snail .
and lots of leaves for the beets .
so detailed isn't it ?
alright well you did amazing on that .
so go ahead and pick another buzzer for me .
and we can move onto the next one .

tess was sitting around the house one sunday afternoon .
she wanted to go play tennis so she asked her mother if she could go to the park .
you can go, but take your brother .
i, i need you to watch him for me said her mother .
tess groaned .
she always had to take her brother along .
she didn't want to take him because he slowed her down .
tess was eight years old and ty was only five .
ty never wanted to go to the park so tess had to convince him it would be fun .
tess really wanted to go so she went to the back room where ty was playing superman on the xbox .
ty let's go to the park, she sang .
no way, said ty .
tess then knew this would happen so she had a plan .
okay, fine .
as tess turned to leave the room, she dropped a bright yellow tennis ball on the floor, rolled it past ty's feet .
ty paused his game and picked up the ball .
where did you get this, he said .
i earned it, said tess, said tess .
ty bounced the ball on the floor .
it was really loud .
he did it again and again until his mother came in and said, take that ball outside .
it's too loud in here .
here ty, give me the ball back .

you can hit them all at once or two at once .
yup .
alright .
this is super easy .
just tell me what's going on in the picture and how you would do it .
well looks like this guy's brushing his teeth .
so how would i do it ?
first i would get my toothbrush wet cause i don't really .
cause i want it wet a lot because toothpaste kinda activates with water so .
that's what i would do .
you have to get it wet so then you get it wet .
and then put toothpaste on it .
and then i scrub it on my mouth .
and all my teeth .
i scrub it on my teeth .
and then, , .
alright good job .
what about this one ?
wash my hands .
well first i get my hands wet cause soap needs to activate with water .
and then i squirt some soap onto my hands .
and then i scrub for a while .
and then i rinse the soap off .
and dry my hands off .
amazing .
alright looks like this guy's tying his shoes .
well how i tie my shoe ?
well i kinda tie it differently than most people would .
so i'm going to show you how i tie mine .
i do like a trick to do it .
i put it in these holes .
that's so cool .
so basically it holds them like that cause it's really hard for me to do that .
and then .
can you describe it to me cause i can't see .
just .
can you describe it, as you're doing it ?
i can't, i can't really describe it .
it's so hard .
like i .
where are you putting the laces ?
that's really cool though that you have that on your shoes .
so like what do you do like, can you tell me like do you do bunny ears ?
do you loop it around ?
well .
i kind of put the ends of the strings and on the holes on either side, on either side of my shoe .
and then i .
and then what i do is i double knot it .
and then take the ends of the shoe laces out .
so it's basically it's tied up so i don't really have to .
that's so creative .
that's a, an easy way to tie your shoes .
maybe i'll try that next .
alright .
looks like this girl is getting breakfast .
and she's pouring cereal into a box maybe ?
how do you make it ?
make cereal ?
well first i get a bowl .
then i get a spoon .
and then i get my cereal .
and then i pour it into the bowl .
and then i get my milk .
and then i pour that into a bowl .
and then i put the milk and cereal away .

what about cookies ?
yes i've made cookies .
how do you make cookies ?
do you know ?
can you describe it to me ?
it's kind of hard .
cause i can't really remember that good .
i think you take eggs, milk, and like flour .
maybe some butter i think .
and i think you mix that all together .
and you add sugar, and add sugar .
then maybe some baking soda .
i can't remember .
and .
and then i guess you put that in the oven .
you can add stuff to it like chocolate chips or something like that .
and then well to ice cookies if you want to ice them .
i think you take butter, sugared powder, and maybe like some .
i don't know .
i don't know .
but i forget what the other ingredient is to icing .
and then you you beat it in like a batter .
and then you basically .
well you take like the butter knife or something like that .
and then you like take some icing, get it on the butter knife .
and then you like put it on the cookie .
you're making me crave cookies now .

and then i get a small little thing of water .
like a small little cup of water .
and then i get my water paints open .
and then well i dip my paintbrush in water .
dip it in one of the watercolors .

cause you want to make sure it's all mixed up .
and then i paint a picture .
good enough .
what do you paint usually if you had to paint something ?
i don't know .
just whatever comes to your mind ?
hmm looks like this guy's getting buckled into a seat .
so basically all you have to do is get your buckle thing .
pull it down this way .
and get it into the clip thing .
and there you go, you got your buckles .
good job .
alright .
okay so like .
now, this girl looks like she's feeding her stuffed animal .
i know isn't that so funny .
i've never done that in my whole life honestly .
at least as long as i can remember .
but i guess you just take like maybe like a bowl and a spoon .
and pretend like there's food inside of it .
grab one of your stuffed animals .
and pretend to feed it so .
i know that's so silly .
but .
alright .

you you ne sometimes you can push yourself with, on that thing with your hands .
and then you go down the slide .
this guy looks like he's kicking a soccer ball .

it's like a plane person outfit .
like a skydiver's .
and his .
his bed's messed up .
he's looking out the .
well the .
his window's open .
he has a picture .
a dresser with his clothes hanging out .
books on his dresser .

and pillows on the floor .
and a sock .
that was very descriptive .
do you want to come up with a story behind what he's doing ?

looking in his window .
with his .
he's wearing, like, a lab outfit .
with the elephant reading a book .
and then there's like a sign up there .
what .

another pillow .
those are definitely fake clouds .

like fake hanging clouds .
okay .
that's cool .
a bunch of them .
does your room look like this ?
no ?
cause i have a loft bed .
cause .
really ?
my dad, my dad built it, handmade .
that was sweet of him .
for christmas .
and he made it my favorite color .
which is pink .
pink .
nice .
and my curtains are pink too .
your what are ?
my, my curtains are pink .
okay .
and i have a big, like a really big barbie house that's pink .
so you got a lot of pink in your room .
right ?
gotcha .
i like that .
and, and dad built me a shelf .
it's of .
is that pink ?
for all my books .
so if you could have a pink dog and pink chinchilla would you have that too ?
and then mom's wearing all pink .
what'd you say ?
mom's wearing all pink, too .
she is wearing all pink .
i feel like we didn't get the memo that we should be wearing pink .
so, why you, why is he like on top of his bed ?
he's probably .
like pretending that he can like fly .
and he's, and he's like having a paper airplane .
going through .
would you ever want to fly a plane ?
no ?
have you ever been in a plane ?
do you like heights ?
you do ?
okay .
what about roller coasters ?
you like roller coasters ?
you're not scared ?
i'm not scared .
you're not .
i'm not scared of even scary movies .
i'm scared of scary movies .
what about ?
okay .
what about like spiders ?
are you scared of spiders ?
i don't like spiders .
you don't like spiders ?
i don't .
okay .
what about snakes ?
a little bit scared ?
i holded a snake before .
really ?
it's .
how big of a snake ?
it was a baby .
just a little one ?
what'd it feel like ?
felt like slimy, a little bit .
was it, was it gross ?
no ?
you're just fearless .
you're not scared of anything .
now what about this picture ?
she's like a scientist .
okay .
she's figuring out a lot of stuff .
and .
and .
the octopus has a pencil and a book .
and then there's two rats .
and then a bunch of books .
where, where do you think she is ?
her bedroom or school .
okay .
so why do you think there's an octopus there ?
cause it's all right here .
what's it ?
but i don't .
he is drawing .
or he's just like writing a book .
okay .
interesting .
and why do you think there's little mice here ?

do you think you would ever want to be a scientist ?
what kind of stuff would you want to study ?
all kinds, all kinds of stuff .
all kinds of stuff ?
think you would get to work with an octopus ?
no ?
cause they're slimy .
cause they're slimy ?
cause they first have to live in water .
right .
and i don't want to have a room full of water .
makes a lot of sense .
even though we have a pond it won't fit a octopus .
what'd you say ?
we have a pond in our front yard, but it will not fit an octopus .
cause we have a lot of fish .
okay .
how many ?
what kind of fish do you have in your pond ?
how big are they ?
we have koi .
and we just have normal fish .
how big are the koi fish ?
we just bought them .
but we have one normal when it got really huge .

like here ?
okay .
and then like the koi fish go to there .
then they get big ?
dang .
you have like .
do you ever try and name them ?
are there just too many ?
there's just too many .
and they all look similar .
okay .
does your dog go and sniff around the pond ?
we jj she normally just stays in the back .
and .
in the inside the house .
gotcha .
and we don't have like something to block the pond though .
we don't cause we have no turtles anymore .
you guys had turtles ?
what kind of turtles ?
how big were they ?
we had three turtles .
and one of them is, was like huge ?
okay .
like this big .
and then the other one was like ss really small .
and then we had one that it had, it had, it had eggs .
really ?
that's cool .
and then but they but they did not come .
okay .
and it ran away, so .
so you really love animals, ?
have you ever thought of wanting to be like a veterinarian when you grow older ?
to help animals .
not really cause i don't really want to see their blood .
but my friend olivia wants to be cause she loves cats .
and dogs .
or you could go help work at a zoo .
you get to hang out with animals and feed them .
that .
i want that .
alright .
how about this picture ?
there's a snail shell ?
and clouds .
and there's a girl .
it's carrying that .
i don't know what that's called .
and then a shovel .

yucky .
do you ever do this ?
sometimes .
alright so this one's a bit different .
it's not really like a task they're doing .
but you can tell me like what they did .
and then if you would ever do this .
it looks like they're dressing up for halloween .
and they've got like a mixed outfit .
they have like a ballerina tutu .
and they have like sneakers .
and i don't know what that is .
like a feather thing .
they got a witch hat, a princess wand, and a tie .
and glasses .
it's a lot of stuff you can wear for halloween .
do you ever dress up like that ?
for halloween usually .
we have a candy drawer and it has so much candy in it .
our old neighbor .
because we moved .
and our old neighbor would give us three hundred suckers .
and that that's how our candy drawer got so full .
that is a lot of candy .
what's your favorite type of candy ?
i really like suckers, twizzlers, gummies, skittles .
that's mostly my favorite .
i, i'm not the chocolate fan .
so i don't like chocolate .
i only like gummy candies and stuff my mom doesn't like .
she only like chocolate .
okay .
my dad made the candy drawer .
my mom doesn't like, like sugary stuff .
she only likes desserts not candy .
do you, what did you dress up as for halloween ?
last year i was jojo siwa .
that girl that sings .
and rhys was a character from a movie .
the nightmare before christmas .
that was a good movie .
we watched it in between christmas and halloween .
cause it's, it's a halloween and a christmas movie .
right .
awesome .
anything else ?
no .
okay .
what's happening here ?
looks like they're maybe at a playground .
and they're waiting turns to slide .
i like slides .
especially the really twisty tube ones .
those ones are fun .
do you like the water slides ?
i haven't been down a water slide actually .
like the big ones .
because last year i wasn't old enough and it was covid so i couldn't go on them anymore .
so how would you go on a slide ?
well there's usually a ladder or stairs to get up to the slide .
and and usually it's one at a time cause you can't always go down the slide at once .
but sometimes me and my friends and rhys would go down the slide all at once and get clogged up at the bottom .
that's so fun .
anything else about this one ?
no .
okay .
what's happening here ?
they're playing soccer .
they're probably in like a field or something .
or in a backyard .
and i've actually never played soccer in real life .
i mean i've played like pretend soccer just kicking a ball around .
we don't really have the yard for it .
cause our yard is mostly ivy .
we have like a treehouse house .
nice .
so we don't have any grass .
okay .
besides down .
we do live in a cul-de-sac so it is really fun to scooter in the cul-de-sac .
cause it's really big and it's not a crazy busy road .
that's so fun .
do you play any sports ?
no .
but sometimes when i'm at my grandma's house we play basketball and ping pong .
that's so fun .
awesome .
what's happening here ?
looks like they're building blocks .
do you ever do that ?
my cousins do it .
i'm actually the oldest cousin so .
all my other cousins have blocks but when i go to their house i build blocks with them .
so i'm the oldest .
the youngest, the oldest other cousin .
the oldest youngest the oldest out of out of, besides me, is my cousin .
and she's four .
i'm still the oldest though .
besides my brother which he's five .
and he is the oldest cousin besides me .
okay .
that's cool though right ?
do you like being the oldest ?
what's happening here ?
looks like they're swinging .
i'm going to a new school this year so there should, there's swings there i think .
there's tire swings .
and those are really fun too cause they spin around .
i use this swing the opposite way you should use a swing .
so i swing the other way like that .
and sometimes i normal swing .
and some parks have swings and some parks don't have swings .
and i do like swinging .
i'm at, i'm, i am asking my mom if we can .
we have so many trees in our yard .
our yard is like the forest .
so we have .
i'm going to ask my mom if we can get one of those tire swing things .
where there's like a bottom and it hangs on a tree .
that would be fun .
i hope you get one .
my cousins have .
my cousin, the four year old cousin i have is, she has one of those .
and i really liked it .
it was fun .
awesome .
alright anything else about this one ?
no .
alright what's happening here ?
they're sharing candy .
i do that with my brother .
we share the candy drawer .
and looks like one girl has a sucker .
and the other girl has a sucker .
and then there's more candy down there .
awesome .
and they're sharing it .
anything else ?
no .
okay what's happening here ?
hmm that's a confusing one .
i can't tell .
what do you see ?
there's like .
it's like, that must be a timer or something .
and he's looking at his shoe .
and thinking about what the shoe looks like or something .
do you ever do that ?
no .
alright .
cause i just slip on .
sometimes i look at my shoes because my shoes are all scuffed up .
and i only got these shoes like two months ago and they're all broken already .
that means you're walking around .
that's good right ?
i like to run a lot .
i run around the house .
but i can't have shoes on in the house .
and i am outside .
and we scooter a lot .
so that's how they get worn out all the, all the time .
does your brother ride your scooter with you ?
he rides this thing called a mini scooter .
it's like a scooter on the ground with like eight wheels .
two in the front, two in the back .
well like four in the back and four in the front .
and then it would like it, you use your feet to push around .
on it .
but he drags his new shoes on the ground .
so he had to change into his old broken shoes .
which they have like huge holes in them .
that's so fun .
i do .
i scooter a lot when it's nice out .
today could be a good day to scooter maybe .
nice out .
last one ?
anything else ?
no .
alright you did so great .
hit a buzzer .
that's awesome .
alright do you want to look through some fun pictures too ?
these are really fun .
so go ahead and tell me what you see here .
what do you think is happening ?
it looks like a girl that's in outer space .
and it has, she has like a jar of like space fireflies or something .
they kinda look like fireflies .
hmm .
she's, has a rope so she can't fly away all the way .
cause you'd get lost in space and you can't swim in space like you can in the water .
so, and she has a jar full of the space fireflies .
and she's probably trying to catch more .
i don't know why she doesn't have a net .
cause you can't just like grab them .
or it would squish them .
yup .
my cat can't kill things .
she can't even kill a mouse or a fly .
she sometimes accidentally eats spiders .
but she just plays with them .
she thinks they're like toys .
we have a bunch of stink bugs and she tries .
she doesn't eat them but she just touches them and rolls them over .
and tries .
she accidentally smushes them with her paws sometimes .
cause she's like a giant .
she's like a giant to the stink bugs .
that's, that's silly .
that's awesome .
alright anything else about this one ?
no .
okay .
we have some silly ones coming up .
you want to like .
so let's look at this one .
we can come back to these if you want .
but what about this one ?
i love that one .
it's a frog in a, in a mug that's like a king or a queen frog .
and it's like, it's got polka dots on it .
or like dots .
and .
how do you think it ended up there ?
probably sneaked in the house when the door was open .
like letting a dog out or something .
and it sneaked in .
and it went in somebody's cup .
it's probably taking a bath in the cup .
anything else ?
no .
okay .
we have some more silly ones .
i like these ones .
giraffe .
it doesn't look like, it's just making sandwiches for the giraffe .
it isn't making sandwiches for himself .
i don't know how that giraffe got into the house .
i bet the boy sneaked it into the zoo .
and it, tried to hid it in his room .
so he's making food for it .
giraffes actually really like lettuce .
i've been to the zoo before and i've fed jjgiraffes lettuce .
they're, they're really slobbery .
they like lick your whole hand .
they, they don't bite though .
i don't even think they have teeth almost .
i didn't know that .
they might have teeth .
cause i can't feel their teeth when they just .
they just kinda .
just like my cat she doesn't bite .
she just little nibbles on you .
she .
so she's pretty friendly ?
anything else about this one ?
no .
okay .
let me find another silly one .
this one .
i think you'll like this one .
it's a goat that's like a princess .
and it's got candy and chocolate coins maybe .
and diamonds .
and .
ever seen something like this ?
no never .
do you .
i play minecraft and i really like that game .
and they just updated it like two days ago .
and they have goats in it now .
and the goats look really funny .
that's so awesome .
they're little white goats .
they don't wear crowns .
they don't wear little party hats or anything .
that's a bummer right ?
it would be funnier if they did and eat pizza .
and have candy and .
and have party hats on .
anything else about this one ?
no .
okay .
let's see .
i feel like there it might be .
this one is silly .
i love pigs .
they're so funny .
it looks like it's sneak into the house and took a bath .
with a, and they're spilling bubbles and water .
my mom would be angry if a pig snuck into the house and took, used, took the bath, and took the bathtub and overflowed it .
i think mine would be too .
it would be bubble .
my mom has a really cool bathtub .
it's a big bathtub .
and it's got, it's got a faucet that's not connected to the wall .
so it's just like, kind of like a shower head .
she has really big cool bathroom .
very cool .
anything else about this one ?
no .
okay .
let's see what else there is .
if you see one you like you can always stop me too .
that one's funny .
it kinda looks like me grooming ramona sometimes .
i, she just, she, i probably be petting her instead of grooming her .
cause she doesn't like to be groomed .
cause i don't even know if we have a groomer .
in the morning she'll wake me up by meowing and asking for food sometimes .
cause she loves wet food .
and she waits all, all night for her wet food refills .
she does have dry food and water at all times .
so she can eat water and dry food when she's hungry .
good .
what does this look like ?
it's a, i think it's like a tiger .
it kinda looks like a lion at the same time .
cause it's like, it's got a mane kind of .
i gave ramona a bath but she just did not like it .
cause she, she can get out of the house sometimes .
and she's not an outdoor cat .
she's an indoor cat .
on accident she gets out sometimes .
and we'll catch her and find her .
but there's poison ivy in our yard so we have to wash her .
and there's only one person that can touch her .
like i don't know .
it could be really anybody but i'm the one that mostly catches her .
good job .
and she knows us so she won't leave our yard .
so she doesn't like baths ?
she doesn't like baths .
she's like if i get out i know i'm going to have a bath after .
smart cat right ?
but she doesn't get soap .
she doesn't have to have soap .
okay .
awesome .
so she just gets in water .
the water gets really hairy .
anything else about this one ?
okay .
now what ?
that one's silly too .
i was getting ice cream the other day .
maybe yesterday ?
it was yesterday .
and i had like the biggest thing of ice cream .
like rhys got a banana split tinfoil of .
it was full of birthday cake and rainbow sprinkles .
and i got a cone of ice cream .
and i, he finished almost half .
and then i ate the rest plus the big cone i had .
so it was a lot of ice cream .
also the birds were out there trying to look for food .
what type of ice cream do you like ?
i like a lot of sorbet .
like i like mango sorbet, watermelon sorbet .
that one, it was only out for one summer so it's not out anymore .
but that was like my favorite flavor ever .
and i like lemon sorbet .
and there's a new strawberry sorbet coming out and i, i want to try that .
i've tried every sorbet they've had .
my favorite's probably mango or lemon .
cause those were really good .
lemonade, it kinda tastes like lemonade .
you like all the sorbets .
i need to try more of them .
we go to graeter's .
that's so, i love graeter's .
so where do you think she's at ?

and you know, you wouldn't have ice cream in the winter .
we go on vacation in july tenth .
we go to south carolina .
and there's a beach there .
and, and my whole dad's side is coming .
cause my mom's side lives like two hours away so it'd be like a fourteen hour drive there .

a baby sitter but for cats .
who else is coming ?
my aunts and my cousins are coming .
my second cousin's coming and their side of the family are coming too .
and we get to stay there for a week .
and it's worth the drive .
my mom has a big van so we get .
i can sit of the back of the car and rhys gets to sit in the front .
well not the front front but in the middle .
and cause sometimes i can't sit my things like .
i have this big stuffed animal that i like to bring some places and it doesn't fit next to me all the time .
what do you like to do at the beach ?
i like to make sandcastles .
i like to play in the water .
i'm always so afraid of stepping in the water cause you can't see .
it's not crystal clear water it's like water with like .
it's bluer water so it isn't crystal clear .
so you cannot always see what you step on .
but there is really cool shells there .
one time i stepped on a shell .
but it was like a really cool shell once i figured out what i stepped on .
it was a big one .
and that's all about that one .

what is he doing ?
he's standing on the bed .
and doing what ?
he's holding up a paper airplane to the sky .
would you do that ?
maybe .
how come his room has no ceiling ?
because he's using his imagination .
this .
is his room messy, do you think ?
just a bit .
if you had to make up a story for this, what would it be ?
okay, so .
once upon a time, there was a little boy .
and he would .
and he was an expert of, of flying airplanes .
and then he crashed !
but good thing he crashed safely .
and then he moved into the house .

i'm going to make a story with this .
okay .
so, there was a girl that was a scientist .
she walked through , the lab .
and, and before, she saw a baby octopus egg in the toilet .
and then, it grew bigger and bigger and bigger until it outgrew the toilet .
and then, it went into the lab while the girl was not looking .
then it, then it stole everything and put it .
and then put it into the mini .
into the big toilet and then flushed itself away .
my gosh .
so they're enemies ?
woah .
i would be scared of that octopus .
are you scared of that octopus ?
or is he a friend ?
are you on the bad side or the good side ?
good side .

so you're with the scientist ?
okay .
well, what is she doing to try to stop the octopus ?
what'd she do ?
she grabs a lightbulb, looks at him, and smash !

how do you think he did that ?
he caught the lion .
he he made ff after like a couple years he noticed him as like you know .

i see .
maybe .
do you have any pets ?

and then the other one likes to growl .
then the rest of them just just kiss me they just .

and then they start putting their paws on my face .
and then they just start licking .
like crazy .

he has a very messy room .
he's pretending he's on something that can fly .
he has a goldfish .
he's in his room and you know two cars .
five hundred pillows .
lots of books .
he's having a dream .

he offered me to fly in the mid air but no .
that's still kind of cool .
so you think you, would you ever want to be a pilot ?
yes .
what kind of places do you want to go if you could be a pilot ?
i could probably go to hawaii .
ooh hawaii .
also i could probably go to .
i might even start an island .
ooh how would you do that ?
i would .
me me and my friends would like .
like there would be like five people on deck .
we they would just they would just sail sail to a random place .
and then we will start building stuff so like docks, houses .
we'll just start building .
okay i like that plan .
is there anything else that you kind of like dream about being or doing kinda like how this kind wants to be a pilot ?
i've been dreaming to be an architect .
okay .
that's a really good .
i love that .
i've always wanted to be in a scientist .
and i also .
you can be in the background wearing lab coats like me .
yes .
yes !
i mean like, i mean like an actual scientist that researches .
and i also wanted to be an engineer so i can like design robots like these .
got you .
and also .
so what, so you're saying architect .
have you built anything before ?
yes i've built a lego tower that's probably about to that tall on the roof .
ooh .
i needed a ladder to get up there .
i've also built i've also built out of cardboard .
i've built like a mini sized house as probably as big as this table i think .
and that we still play with it .
he's impressed .
well that's pretty impressive .
yes .
you're only eight right ?
ooh i could see you being an amazing architect .
and i also and i also built a cardboard computer .
what ?
okay tell me about that .
it was kinda like that computer except it was it was just cardboard .
okay i get you .
so no so like no technology was .
so what made you think about wanting to like do go into architecture or science or engineering .
i .
when i .
i thought about it when my mom told me there was a job called architecting .
and i was like ooh what's architecting ?
and then she told me it's where you can design anything you want .
and i was like .
and then i started building things so .
is there anything you really want to build ?
i've always wanted to build a unique building so like .
so it's like a figure eight building so i don't know if it'll stand up well but .
it's going to it's going to be a figure eight hotel .
ooh .
and that will move it if it's like you know, if it's like hot or cold .
are there any buildings that you've been in that you're like this is really cool ?
no but i've seen videos of buildings .
like you know the the tower that like changes if it's like too dark you just you just say .
i think i don't think you've seen it but i think it's like in europe .
somewhere in europe .
so you want to make cool ones like that ?
yes .
i've been also designing buildings in minecraft also .
okay so you're a minecraft fan .

i'm i'm dd i am designing a very futuristic mansion right now .
okay .
and i'm also designing a a solar paneled like a red stone garden .
kind of like it'll do it by itself .
so like so like instead of instead of me planting it the villagers will plant it .
so do you do you do all this in creative or survival ?
survival .
nice .
but i just i just i just get the materials in creative but just because it'll waste my time .
exactly it's easier it's easier .
alright well i can't wait to see your name on some famous magazine or newspaper .
alright tell me as much as you can about this one .
he looks like he's a scientist .
there's an octopus probably stealing all .
maybe he's helping or he's stealing all his things .
there's two rats .
he's in a science lab .
books .
gibberish .
and a lot more .
so you said he's either helping or .
it looks like he's helping .

and then she's holding it .
and then she's going to screw it on .
okay .
what's all this stuff in the background ?
that's all her supplies that she needs .
okay okay .
so why do you think there's an octopus in the lab ?
i have no idea .
maybe he's just helping .
i don't know if he's stealing anything .
yes .
alright so when you're some amazing mad scientist that you're going to be .
would you have .
would you let an octopus in your lab ?
maybe if i trained it well .
trained it ?
okay .
so it would be like your little helper .
yes .
what would you name him ?
i would probably name him octopi because he's going to be married to another octopus .
and then he's going to be .

didn't i get to pet the baby cheetahs ?
what did a baby cheetah feel like ?
super soft .
i was like three .
and i have a stuffed animal that i got from the zoo that day .
and i named it bobo cheetah .
but if i had knew how to say the cheetah's names .
there were three sisters .
and if i knew how to say their names i probably would have named it that .
you weren't scared then ?
no ?
would you get in a boat with a cheetah then ?
a baby cheetah .
okay .
do you remember how big the baby cheetah was ?
probably like that big .
they were tiny .
little .
very little .
and then one of them died .
last year .
which zoo did you go to ?
columbus .
okay .
cool .
so are cheetahs your favorite animal ?
yes .
any other animals you think that are like second and third ?
giraffe and monkey .
cause cause i'm a monkey .
you're a monkey ?
yes .
why are you a monkey ?
cause i climb on the counter .
and i climb on the bunk bed not using the ladder .
i grab up on it .
and i jump .
and i pull myself up .
would you get into a boat with a monkey ?
they'd probably flip the boat so no .
you think so ?
why ?
cause it would be bouncing around .
okay .
unless it was sleeping .
and still it'd probably be jumping around .
okay .
well how about this picture ?
tell me as much as you can about this one .
he's in his bedroom standing on a bunch of pillows .
like it's a mountain .
and it looks like on his bed .
and he has cars .
and sock .
and looks like another pillow on the floor .
he has a fish .
and he has a paper airplane .
and he's flying them out the window .
like he .
and he's dressed up like a pilot .
and he's acting like he is driving a plane .
does your room look like that ?
no .
why not ?
cause at my dad's i live in my own house .
but then at my mom's my house caught on fire so i live in my aunt's basement .
okay .
cool .
so it's not my real room .
okay .
well do you clean your room a lot ?
i actually just cleaned it .
well that's good .
how often do you clean your room ?
she doesn't want to say .
it's not too often .
it's not to disclose .
i have no idea .
okay .
well would you ever want to be a pilot like this kid ?
no .
why not ?
cause i want to be a vet .
okay .
so you want to help animals ?
what kinds of animals do you want to help ?
big and small .
okay, what kind of big ones ?
like farm animals .
so like horses, and cows, and llamas, and alpacas .
i want to be like dr pol .
okay .
have you hung out with horses and cows ?
and we go over there sometimes .
then i take horse back ridings .
and i've done it ever since i was like three .
what kind of horse do you ride ?
all kinds .
all kinds ?
do you have a favorite ?
micky mouse .
micky mouse ?
okay tell me about micky mouse .
he's kind of a shorter horse .
he's brown .
very very loving .
he does not like to lope .
he'll park you right into the wall .
okay .
rude .
yes .
rude .
actually i have two favorites .
okay .
and then .
you could probably .
if his stall was clean he could be laying down in his stall .
and you cuddle up with him .
really ?
he's super sweet .
that's cute .
really ?
yes .
he's mean .
like he was at the fair .
and there was literally this huge sign that said do not touch i bite .
my gosh .
and my aunt was like .
yep there really was .
his name's gator ?
what does gator look like ?
he's a white horse .
he looks like the frozen two spirit horse .
oo .
kind of .
he's just a little bit darker of a white .
okay .
but now he's a stinker butt .
so we both hate him now .
mickey mouse ?
yes .
mickey mouse and aerie .
who ?
aerie ?
who's aerie ?
she is pretty .
what's she look like ?
she's big .
she .
i think she's like a light brown .
and .
she is the same as mick .
if she's laying down in the stall you could probably cuddle up with her .
that's sweet .
and she's very easy to ride .
she doesn't really like to trot .
she likes to walk but she'll go slow as a turtle .
okay .
and then she loves to lope .
because like i had a lope and la, last lessons .
and she didn't even go to the past trot .
so she starting trotting .
and then went straight into a lope .
she she loves to lope .
okay .
that was the first time i rode her .
that's sweet .
okay .
now how about this picture ?
what's going on here ?
it looks like she's a scientist .
and she's in her lab .
she has a whole bunch of stuff .
and she has a pet octopus .
okay .
that can write in books .
and she has a two rats .
she has a lightbulb in her hand .
looks like she has a lot of posters .
looks like she studies human body .
cause of that .
what's that ?
i'm pretty sure it's like .
if you would have a x-ray .
and you looked at the genes .
and that person .
it's called d n a .
that's actually my initials .
that's why it's funny .
and .
, he's got a couple of posters .
if you are going to be a vet are you going to help octopuses too ?
no .
why not ?
cause i'm only helping land animals .
okay .
so there's .
and not zoo animals .
there's a distinction .
okay, gotcha .
gotcha .
unless it's an emergency .
do you think the octopus is helping her with science ?
maybe ?
how do you think she got a octopus into the lab ?
i don't know .
you don't know ?
how would you try and sneak an octopus into a lab ?
no clue .
you don't have any ideas ?
i wouldn't think of that .
you wouldn't ?
okay .
no .
it looks like this one rat likes to hang out by the trashcan .
what do you think ?
why do, why do you think he likes to hang out by the trashcan ?
cause he probably wants the trash in there to eat it .
probably .
like a raccoon did .
okay .
what about this one ?
you're doing great .
it looks like it's a girl .
and she pulled a huge onion .
and then she has carrots growing .
maybe it's an onion .
i don't know .
and then it looks like she's got some snails .
and she has more onions .
and it looks like that onion is very big .
i don't know how she grew it that big but .
i don't even know how that will fit on the chopping board to chop it up .
do you think you could eat an onion that big ?
i don't even like onions .
you don't even like onions ?
alright .
never mind .
and even if i did i don't think i could .
ma i'd be crying .
my eyes would be watering .
you do any gardening ?
what do you like to have ?
i .
in your garden ?
we .
and we planted flowers .
and they grew back this year .
and like my garden is so full of flowers .
it literally .
like the flowers just collapsed down to the ground .
we had to like put it behind other flowers that stay up .
so they stay up .
and then we have .
we got these things .
and it's like stepping stones and a fairy house and a bridge little pebbles to put in it .
and we make a little fairy garden each year .
but now we have a boy cousin so we have to find him a dinosaur garden .
we already got her a fairy garden like ours .
okay .
what are you going to do with the ?
what are you going to put the dinosaur garden ?
he's little .
he can crawl really really fast though .
i can't beat him when i crawl .
it hurts .
hurts my knees .
but i don't know how he does it .
okay .

snails ?
have you ever held a snail ?
no .
wait .
no .
no .
no .
no .
no .
what do you think a snail would feel like when you held it ?
slimy .
the shell would be hard .
i probably just drop it and run and scream .

we got through that .

a pond .
a lily pad .
a flower .
dragonfly .
that's all i see .
there is leaves ?
grass .
what about ?
yep .
boat .
i don't see anything else .
so what's going on in this picture ?
who are they ?
how did they get there ?
you can make it up .
they they were on an adventure .
and then a lion hopped into their boat .
what !
what would you do if that happened to you ?
i would .
scream probably .
why is he not screaming ?
what do you think happened next ?
then they .
then .
maybe they became friends .
so what do you think they're setting off to do ?
what would the lion want with the boy ?
how would the boy help him ?
maybe they are going to a zoo .
that's a good idea .
so where do you think they are in the world ?
probably .
i would say probably .
west virginia ?
okay .
what ?
anything else you see here ?
or any other ideas you have about this picture ?
okay .
what's going on here ?
this boy is throwing a paper airplane .
and pretending it's a plane .
and he's driving in it .
and he's on his bed with a ton of pillows .
and there is a toy truck under his bed .
and a toy car right next to his bed .
and a sock .
and another pillow right next to the sock .
and there's a fish in a fishbowl .
there's books .
and there is a window .
and clouds outside .
anything kinda funny about this picture ?
or out of place ?
there is .
a ss there is .
the whole .
an airplane in his room .
there's an airplane in his room .
have you ever played pretend before ?
what do you like to play pretend as ?
a wrestler .
a wrestler ?
is that what you want to be when you grow up ?
probably not .
i'll probably be maybe a firefighter .
that's awesome .
so what does his ?
does his room look like your room at home ?
no .
what's different about it ?
there's a fish .
and there is a bunch .
and there is a painting .
and there is books on his dresser .
so it's a little ?
yours is just set up a little differently ?
what's he wearing ?
he's wearing a flight suit .
kinda like a ?
and goggles .
and a ff a hat .
any other ideas about this picture ?
he's wearing slippers on his bed .
i i don't see anything .
that's it ?
alright .
there is a scientist with a light bulb .
and there's an octopus in their lab .
and there is books on the grab ground .
and there's a la two labs rats .
and the .
it looks like the periodic table .
right there .
good eye .
and there .
and the octopus is holding a mire magnifying glass .
right next to the periodic table .
and the octopus is also holding a pencil and a notebook .
with .
and there is d n a on a little poster .
and there's little scientist stuff all over .
little things where you pour it together .
and then it makes something new .
and that's a trash can .
and there's a huge desk with books on the ground .
that's all i see .
and the octopus is also holding .
and the octopus is .
also .
and there's a plant .
and a cup .
probably with water .
that's all i see .
that's a really good description .
so you think everything in there is for different experiments or ?
what do you think the experiment she is doing right now ?
studying electricity .
kinda like the exhibit you just were in .
that's awesome .
so the reason the octopus is there on purpose as like a helper ?
or do you think it is not supposed to be there ?
what does it look like ?
it looks like it's in a little .
it's a helper .
it's writing notes .
it's putting a magnifmagnifying glass right next to the perperiodic table .
so she can see .
i see .
that makes sense .
well what do you think about the rats then ?
they're probably going to be like sub subtests .
to see what different medicines do .
so they're a part of the experiments .
makes sense .
any other ideas you have about this picture ?
or experiments she might be doing ?
she might be studying the op octopus .
that's .
that's very going to help me .
but i'm also going to study you .
that'd be wild .
do you ?
there's a trash can .
do you think that you would ever want to do something like the scientist would ?
or is that not ?
nah .
not really ?
no .
alright last one of this .
there is a girl holding a giant beet root .
and there's .
and she's in a garden with carrots .
and there's a snail .
and there's a snail in a sh-sh and there's a snail in a shell .
and there is a shovel .
and there's a bunch of beet roots around there .
there's clouds .
there's grass .
it looks like she's in like a garden .
so what do you think is going on in this picture ?
she's probably farming .
getting like the beet root .
the carrots .
do you think she owns the farm or ?
probably her parents own the farm .
so do you think that she's like a normal sized kid and that's huge ?
or do you think she's really small ?
like what's the ?
what makes the most sense to you ?
the beet root's really big because those care .
because the other beet roots and carrots are smaller .
that's that's a good deductive skills .
what about the snails though ?
are they just closer to the picture ?
or do you think that they're big too ?
they're they're closer to the picture .
gotcha .
have you ever been on a farm before ?
i think ?
maybe ?
vague memory ?
what what would you grow if you had a farm ?
i would probably grow carrots .
because i loved cooked carrots .
that's a good that's a good plan .
so you'd you'd enjoy being on this farm then ?
any other ideas about this one ?
there's a fence in the background .
and .
is the fence for ?
probably keeping animals out .
or keeping animals in .
well either way .
that would make sense .

and they turned around .
and there was a tiger behind him .
how'd he get out ?
in the boat, boat .
he broke the cell .
he broke the thing that he was in .
and they were going in the water .
and then the fish said what the lion doing here .
and then the lion fell in the water .
and then the boy fell in the water .
and then the boy swam away .
and the tiger .
well that's a long story .
no i mean i did not expect the fish to pop in that story though .
it's kinda funny .
anything else about this picture you want to say ?
i see sky .
you're exactly right .
nothing much in the sky in this one ?

let me tell you .
you ready ?

and then i see a tree and a broken sock that was knitted .
and i see a bed and a lamp light .
pajamas sticking out .
dresser .
airplanes, paper airplanes .
a plane .
goggles .
clothes .
the story is the boy wanted to be a pilot .
so he always pretends to .
so he makes paper airplanes .
and he pretends he is up in the sky .
and he's a pilot .
and he also likes to dress up .
where do you think he got those clothes ?
for his birthday from his mom or his dad or his grandpa ?
and .
any other ideas ?
anything else you see, you want to talk about ?
well i see some books .
maybe he read about a pilot .
and he wanted to be a pilot .
i like your imagination .
so thank you for sharing with me .
same thing here .
that's the one you've got on your shirt !
that's cool .
so there's a girl .

and there's a lot on the floor .
magnifying glass .
paper, paper .
clipboard .
scientist stuff .
and posters .
another clipboard or something on the wall .
books and a lightbulb and drawers .
and the story is .
there was a girl who always loved to be a scientist .
and one time a octopus .
she .
there was octopus who .
she was supposed to be looking out for her mom who was a scientist also .
and she was in the lab .
and she was supposed to let nothing happen to the lab .
and this octopus came in .
and she didn't know it sh because she was so curious about this lightbulb .
that the octopus started breaking all of the stuff .
and her mom said i'll never let you go in this lab again .
and .
she, when she got older she had to make her own lab because her mom kicked her out of the house .
i think that's a great entrepreneur story .
she said i'll start my own .
what was so interesting about the lightbulb ?
what do you think ?
well .
maybe because she it she was trying to make it like .
she was just looking at it .
and say how could i use this in a lab or something ?
awesome .
anything else ?
anything you know about these other tools or why these rats might be in there ?
maybe because they're using them .
and they broke out of the things .
and that's one of the reasons .
and they're trying to figure out what rats do but they broke out because of the octopus .
i mean between the lions, the octopus, and the rats, we can't keep these animals contained !
alright last one here .
well there is a girl .
and she's planting a garden .

and some vegetables .

and so she's taking out all the stuff .
and she was about to eat it when there was a snail inside the radish because they, it was so big .
and she threw it on the ground .
and she pulled out all the other stuff .

you have to have some water ww in a cup to brush the paint out so you can do other colors .
and then you paint a pretty picture .
putting on your seat belt .
well it depends what seat belt you have .
if you have the one that straps in and then has the one at the bottom .
you put on this this strap first .
and then you put on .
and then you pick up this thing .
and then you put that one in .
and then you put that one on .
if it's the other one, you just put it take it .
and then you put it around you .
and that's pretty simple .
thank you for the specificity .
that's awesome .
okay .
feeding your bear .
that's a silly one .
okay so you get pretend food .
and then you put it in the bear's mouth .
and that's kind of it .
alright now i want you to tell me what they're doing .
and would you do the same thing ?
and if so like what would you choose to do ?
okay so they are putting on costumes .
and yes i would like to do that .
i like doing that .
but i wwwould like to put on like princess dresses or something like .
you like those ?
or well different costumes but not like a tutu, a bow tie, a hat .
that's kind of a wild amount .
okay so going down a slide .
i love to go down slides but i like to do like tall slides .
like the really tall ones ?
nn-nnnot like those water slides .

like higher higher than the baby slide .
right .
no i get what you're saying .
soccer .
yes i love to play soccer .
yes in fact dad is the coach .
my dad's the coach of some .
what positions do you like to play ?
i like to play offense because then you get to try to score goals .
and i was the gold team .
and i like games more than practices because you get to like play people .
and is it ?
that's fun .
are you guys able to work as a team to score or is it still a lot of ?
kind of doing things individually ?
well it depends .
some people some people they .
well one person .
we lost a couple of goals because they didn't pass .
i mean i was right on the other side .
they could've passed .
but the goalie is so focused on her then the goalie's so focused on her .
and they could've passed .
and then we could've scored .
so .
but .
that's what everybody needs to learn better ?
but but ss but that's it's only one person .
ss ss a lot of other people they play, they pass to people .
awesome .
building blocks .
okay so i would do that .
i guess .
my brother would do that .
i would do it if i was three or four but .
you don't play with your brother's blocks or you do ?

that's okay .
can you think of any situations where you would give away candy and be happy about it ?

the djembe .

the world djembe means everyone come together in peace .
this drum is played to tell a story .
people often come together to play their drum in a group .
three or four maybe maybe play together to make a drum circle .
people come together to hear the drum music .
and they like to dance to the beat .
the people also tell a story with their dancing .
the djembe .
the djembe has a shell made fr of hard wood .
the the top is made from the skin of a goat .
it can be different sizes .
this kind of drum can be twelve to fifteen inches around .
and is as high .
and as high as twenty three to twenty five inches tall .
it can be eleven to twenty nine pounds .
this kind of drum can make different kinds of sounds .
it can sound low .
or it can sound high .
the music can also be quiet .
or can be very loud .
a a long time ago only the men would play the drum .
it was rare to see women play the drum in the west africa .
so people were surprised when when the women had to work very hard to get to play .
now there are women drum circles .
and women are just as good at playing the music as the men .
this kind of drum is first played in west africa .

his heart was beating very .
tut .
rapidly .

his feet moved slowly .
there were children in front of deon and children behind him too .
how will all of us get out of the tunnel he thought .
deon was scared .
his feet would not go .
the stars kept spinning .
and he felt dizzy .
jana held deon's hand and smiled .
you can do this jana said .
i am here with you .
the kids in front of deon were gone .
the children behind deon waited for deon to move .
deon took a deep breath .
he walked slowly .
jana held deon's hand .
then deon opened his eyes .
and he was out of the tunnel .
thank you jana said deon .
i was afraid at first .
but you helped me be brave .
i do not feel dizzy anymore .
i'd like to try it again .
i'm proud of you deon .
you were quite brave said jana .
deon and jana .
ran to nana .

why can't you both go down ?
because you will kick each other's butt .
no .
that wouldn't be good .
where are slides usually ?
outside .

that's a pretty tall one .
do you ever get scared to go down it ?
no .
no ?
does your sister ?
no .
she's the one who's barely ever afraid .
but she was afraid to go in that tunnel in the water .
i mean the ocean area .
there was a tunnel .
she was afraid to go in it .
but i went in it .
then i came out .
because there was a bunch of kids screaming in there .

standing on pillows .
and didn't fall .
and that sock looks like it's laying like with a foot in it but there's no foot in it .
and .
those are giant paper airplanes .
yes .
and it kinda looks like the clouds are in his room .
but there's a roof in the room .
so that's .
impossible .
so what do you think this kid's doing ?
probably pretending to be a pilot .
how's he pretending ?
with his brain .
like .
what is he holding or ?
airplanes .
do you think that he's going to throw them anywhere ?
probably out the window .

so what do you think they're doing here ?
probably pretending to be scientists .
okay .
do you think that they know the octopus is there ?
probably ?
okay .
so are they working together or what's going on ?
probably .
because .
or the octopus is just looking through his diary .
okay .
what type of science do you think they're doing ?
probably .
i'm actually not sure .
that's okay !
do you see anything on the shelf here ?

like a bottle .
and then he put the lid on it .
and he forgot to wear safety goggles .
and looked up .
and it went everywhere .
no !
and he's so funny !
it was everywhere !
but thanks to me, i was the only one that had like extra clothes in my ff locker thing .
so everybody else was all dirty and gross while i was clean .
i guess that's good, right ?
that's a bummer for everyone else .
but good for you .
because we were supposed to bring them for gym clothes .
well that sounds kind of fun i guess, right ?
we went to like three weeks before the end of school .
it took like two days for the stink to get out .

a garden is a small place where people grow food or flowers .

it's okay .
to grow nice vegetables and flowers .
a .
vegetables and flowers .
a spot that face south is best .
good soil .
is a kind of dirt .
pile the soil like a small hill so the water can go down .
the pile of soil should be about twelve inches, or the size of .
a ruler .
it is good for your plants to .
or plants if worms live in the soil .
to invite .
to invite worms, put cut leave .
put cut leaves up .
put cut up leaves and .

i am here with you .
the kids in front of deon were gone .
the children behind deon waited for deon to move .
deon took a deep breath .
he walked slowly .
jana held deon's hand .
then deon opened his eyes .
and he was out of the tunnel .

that's cool .
we actually have a robot here .
he's just sleeping today .
his name is jibo .
he sleeps in that box up there .
that blue box up there on the shelf .
what does he look like ?
he is a little white .
he's about this big .
and he's a white robot .
and he's .
how does he fit in there ?
the box is kind of long .
it looks .
it's longer than it looks .
and he .
he talks to kids too .
he's just sleeping today .
so sometimes, people like me talk to you guy, talk to kids .
but sometimes jibo does all the talking .

well, then we're in trouble .
that does happen sometimes .
alright .
do you want to hit a buzzer for me ?
okay .
i want you to pick one of these pictures to talk to me about .
i'll do space .
okay .
so, she's in space .
and she's chasing after something .
but what thing ?
i don't know .
and that cord should not be connected to her helmet .
why ?
because it should be connected to an oxygen tank .
it's dangerous to have it connected to the helmet because the helmet could get pulled off .
and then .
so you can't breathe in space ?
you can't without oxygen .
why ?
because there's no oxygen in space unless you bring it up there .

why mars ?
because no one has walked on it yet .
only people have walked on, on the moon .
so, why not uranus or jupiter ?
why mars ?
well, because mars is one of the closest planets to earth .
how would you get there ?
in a rocket .

when i make lego towers, it .
it goes like .

but i would not sit with the swing just under my knees .
i would definitely sit on the seat .
definitely .
anything ?
any ?
anyone push you ?
usually my mom .
okay .
where do you play swings at ?
at the park .

it's bad for your teeth, right ?
my brother has a lot more candy than me .
this boy is sitting in .
i think he might be on timeout .
so .
he probably did something he shouldn't have been doing .
why do you think he's on timeout ?
he probably jumped over the back of the couch .
did you ever get a timeout ?
a lot !
what did you do ?
i don't really like telling .

and then they got on a boat and sailed .
so but why ?
to get away from something ?
get away from what ?
you can be .
a dragon .
a dra .
okay that explains why the lion is scared ?
why are they in a boat together ?
because they're friends .
would you be friends with a lion ?
maybe .
what would that depend on ?
not eating me .
well that's fair .
that's fair .
what kinda jungle do you think they're in ?
like what do you .
what do you see around ?
where do you think they are ?
a swamp jungle .
where do you think that would be ?
in the world .
in a rain forest .
that'd be pretty cool .
do you know any other animals that might be in a rain forest other than these ?
crocodiles .
could be .
other bugs .
probably a lot of bugs .
you're right .
anything else you want to tell me about this picture ?
alright let's see another one .
tell me what you see .
a man standing on his bed with a plane hat throwing a paper airplane .
and the bed is in his room .
and he has trucks, a sock, a pillowcase .
lots of air stuff .
and an open window .
that is a great attention to detail .
thank you ben .
let's see .
so what do you think he's doing ?
like was he ?
he's throwing a paper airplane .
because he wants to be a pilot .
so he's pretending to be a pilot .
he's pretending .
have you .
what do you like to pretend to be ?
when you play pretend .
animals .
made up stuff .
and .
zookeepers .
ww i .
it makes sense if you want to be both animal and zookeeper, you'd be a friend to the animals .
i like it .
what .
what else do you notice about his room ?
is it like your room ?
no it's way too messy .
what's messy about it ?
he got a sock on the floor .
he hh .
it looks like he hasn't cleaned for like two weeks .
that's a good observation .
does he have any pets ?
a fish .
do you have any pets ?
we had a pet .
it died .
i'm sorry to hear that bud .
it was a dog .
that's .
named olive .
dogs are much better than fish, ?
yes .
okay .
because they're playful .
unlike cats .
and fish .
and other stuff .
i fully agree with you on that .
okay .
anything else you see here you want to tell me about ?
that it doesn't look like my room since i have a bunk bed .
you do ?
that's all .
are you bunk bed to yourself or do you share ?
i share with my little brother william .
we also call him .
that's a cute nickname .
so you saying you guys both keep it clean better than him .
i bet your mom's happy to hear that .
william doesn't do much anything .
he just does stuff .
i just clean .
keep the room clean after mom cleans it when i'm away .
so do you think you're going to help him get better at it when he gets older ?
maybe .
maybe .
awesome anything else here ?
no .
alright .
how about this one ?
it's a crazy scientist with an octopus .
and a rat .
and lots of stuff she wants to experiment with .
and another rat .
you found them .
do you know what any of that stuff is ?
magnifying glass .
a pencil .
magnifying glass .
safety goggles .
a clipboard .
a lightbulb .
a trashcan .
books .
and papers about experimenting .
yup makes sense .
have you done any experiments before ?
not too many .
well you're doing one right now .
so how's that make you feel ?
confused .
well what you're going to learn today is science .
science is not just this .
it's talking too so you're doing great at it .
anything else on these shelves ?
plants .
a magnifying glass .
a bowl .
and some other stuff .
what kind of experiment do you think she's doing ?
is she doing it with the octopus or on the octopus ?
with the octopus since the octopus is writing stuff down for her .
that makes sense .
and she's trying to make a lightbulb go on .
do you think she's going to succeed ?
no because she looks like a potion scientist .
you know, she has potion stuff so maybe she'll be more successful at that .
yes .
why are the rats there ?
i don't know what that means .
wwwhy .
how did the rats get in here ?
are they there on purpose or did they sneak in ?
they look like they're science pets .
or they look like they have a hole here .
and they just be there .
that would make sense too .
or maybe they smelled cheese .
i think all of those are good possibilities .
anything else you see here or want to tell me about ?
no .
okay .
last one in this section .
a fantasy person because she has a ginormous radiradish .
and snails, leaves, more radishes .
and she's at a farm .
so what makes you say this is a fantasy person ?
because it's so ?
the radish is so big ?
is that what you're saying ?
yes .
so well then in this fantasy world, why are the snails here then ?
what purpose do they serve ?
they eat the leaves .
have you been on a farm before ?
my grandpa owns one so of course i have .
that's awesome .
so you know the stuff that they have to do around the farm .
what do they have to do around a farm ?
like things to take care of or chores to do .
my grandpa doesn't really do most of it .
but there is .
but we do have somebody named ed who like does all the like field work .
and then they split the money .
that's awesome .
that they get for selling the stuff .
do you .
so grandpa all he does is pay for ththe stuff they need to work the field .
ed does the rest .
that's .
that yep that's how a lot of that works .
so what do you think she does around the farm ?
do farm stuff .
does she have tools with her ?
what did .
what could she do with the tools ?
use a shovel to dig up that fantasy radish .
would you .
have you eaten a radish before ?
no .
would you eat this fantasy radish ?
no .
why not ?
i dd .
i don't want .
i don't want to eat a radish since the only fruit i really eat is like strawberries and .
apples .
i can't think of any other since i don't know if corn's a fruit .

alright, let's go on to next one !
okay, so what do you see here ?
this boy hh is in his room with a bunch of pillows that he's standing on .
and they're .
the pillows are on his bed .
and he has toys scattered everywhere .
window's open .
and then he's imagining that his paper airplane will fly above the clouds .
there's a little bookcase over there with a little fish .
there's a little plane he's imagining .
and all the clouds .
and then he has the window open .
and i think he's going to fly stuff out there .
and then there's a little tree out there .
that sounds like a great prediction of what's happening .
and he's wearing a suit, costume .
have you ever done something like this before ?
i don't think so .
you don't like to play with paper airplanes ?
well, i make them .
but .
what do you like to play with ?
toys .
i really like building with legos .
have you heard about the new lego mario sets that are out now ?
i have not .
if you like mario and you like it too much i guess, you can get them lego sets .
and if you love legos too .
that's so cool !
what do you build with your legos ?
i like to build little creations .
i'm thinking about actually posting them in lego life magazines .
i'm really hoping i can !
that sounds so cool !
in my books and my lego life magazines, there's a little code you can scan .
you can vote on how you like magazines, like this little magazine .
oo, awesome !
cool .
so would you say that this room is clean or messy ?
i'd say that it's a little bit messy .
honestly it's not like mine .
honestly .
what is yours like ?
i cleaned it up .
actually, we don't live here .
we just took a trip .
so i cleaned my room .
awesome !
now i live in at a hotel .
and i don't think it's too dirty .
okay .
i think we're getting too far into this dirty thing .
no !
it's all great .
alright .
so all great .
so what things do you see down here or up here ?
a truck .
a sock .
a car .
a pillow on the floor .
other pillow .
his sheets are draping down .
and the trucks are under his bed .
and then there's pictures .
and then a couple books .
i don't know what that is .
i think it's a towel hanging out of his few drawers right there .
there's three drawers .
and his pet fish .
do you have a pet fish ?
i used to .
what was it's name ?
rainby .
that's so cool .
a rainbow fish .
oo .
she died .
but now we have a crab .
and we got him from the beach .
he has a few snail friends left .
that's so cool !
i've .
i'm sorry about your fish .
and we still have two cats, smokey and bandit .
smokey's the friendliest and most adventurist .
that's awesome .
what do they look like ?
smokey's gray .
she's a tabby .
and then bandit's black .
she has kind of a white tuxedo under her .
she has a white underbelly .
the thing is, when you actually get really nice to her and she gets to know you .
i'm basically their brother .
so when she gets to know you pretty well, sometimes she'll go and show you her underbelly .
because she trusts you .
and then you can do belly rubs .
she really loves belly rubs .
that's awesome !
she purs some of the time but not , you know, as often as smokey .
cool !
they've been cuddly lately .
i don't know why .
maybe she just likes hanging out with yah .
okay .
alright well done .
so, what about up here ?
what's ?
what do you see here ?
the boy's face .
a paper airplane .
and then there's a little airplane right here .
and then there's clouds .
i think there's wind effects .
i don't know .
why's there a paper airplane right there ?
is he throwing it ?
and then there's a little paper airplane there .
and he's .
basically it's his imagination .
okay .
so you think it's the imagination ?
yep .
so you .
the clouds, do you think they're actually there, or ?
imagination .
okay .
awesome !
anything else that you want to talk about here ?
okay we'll go on to the next one !
alrighty, what's happening here ?
i guess a scientist girl just did an experiment .
and she's holding a light bulb .
and she's taking a few notes .
i think .
i don't know if that's a pet rat .
but .
she has a pet octopus who is studying i guess ?
and then she has all these charts up here .
and then she is growing a plant .
and then she has a little, little microscope right here .
and a little bowl .
and then there's jars of stuff .
and she's running an experiment .
and maybe she's carrying stuff right here .
i like the way she's dressed too .
kind of like you guys .
kind of like us, right ?
with the coats ?
but she doesn't have a name tag though .
so, do you think that the octopus is helping or maybe she doesn't know it's there or she does know ?
what do you think is happening ?
i think it's her pet probably .
awesome !
and what is the octopus holding ?
she's .
he's holding a microscope .
and then he's studying a book .
have you ever done a science experiment before ?
yep .
what's ?
what's one that you've really enjoyed ?
crystal growing .
we grew a little crystal on a stick .
it was edible .
it didn't really taste like we expected it .
but it was really good experiment .
after all we haven't finished my christmas list of experiments .
still got them .
did you get one at school or with your family ?
with my family at home .
that's nice .
before we got the cats .
is there another one you enjoy maybe at school or with your family ?
we do a lot of, experiments at school .
we definitely like newton's law .
i like the little things that swing back and forth .
it's a really good law of motion .
very cool !
so .
did you notice this right here ?
a little plant she's growing .
have you ever grown a plant yourself ?
well i've planted some .
planted some .
was it fun or you didn't like it or ?
no .
maybe it's still at home .
it's actually a few plants .
they're growing .
maybe like ten, twelve .
i don't know .
very cool .
just little stems, just poking out .
are they supposed to get really big or ?
i actually don't know .
alright !
but my mom has a few flowers though .
awesome !
so you help her take care of those ?
well, she does it on her own .
but i help her with other things .
that's nice of you .

alright .
anything else about this one ?
okay .

and a snail right there .
she has a little fence guarding it .
there's clouds up here .
and she's wearing farmer clothes .
it's a girl .
and there's soil down here .
she's wearing boots .
and then she just grew a ginormous radish or a beet ?
something .
but she pulled these two .
then she has a little shovel that she digs up with .
so do you think that sh this is her farm or do you think that she's working on it or what ?
basically i think she has the farm with maybe her dad, stepdad, mom, stepmom .
maybe she lives alone .
it'd be hard to live alone, though .
so she has this really large vegetable, right ?
i think it's maybe a radish i think .
you think it's a radish ?
okay what do you think she's going to do with it ?
eat it .
she's going to eat it ?
all by herself ?
and it would probably be as big as this table .
this is taking long to chop .
have you ?
have you ever been on a farm like this ?
i think so .
i've been on a couple farms in my life .
my first set of gran, grandparents have a farm .
it's still running .
very cool !
my mom grew up there .
so if you could have your own farm, what would you want to plant ?
peanut butter jelly kk trees .
i don't know if it's possible .
but at least it would conserve soil .
anything else you'd grow up there ?
any fruits or other veggies ?
maybe .
well a few .

a pear .
pear .
another pear .
another carrot .

you're doing an awesome job !
thanks !
do you like reading ?
my goodness .
do you want to try reading this page for us ?
sure .
thank you .
i know this is a djembe .
same page .
no, you can start with that .
the djembe is a drum from west africa .
the word djembe means everyone come together in peace .
this drum is played to tell a story .
people often come together to play their drum in a group .
three or four may be played together to make a drum circle .
people come together to hear the drum music .
and they like to dance to the beat .
the people also tell a story with their dancing .
the djembe has a shell made of hard wood .
the top is made from the skin of a goat .
okay .
i actually didn't know that .
well anyways .
it can be different sizes .
ss this kind of drum can be made twelve to fifteen inches around and as high as twenty three to twenty five inches tall .
it can be eleven to twenty nine pounds .
this kind of drum can make different kinds of sounds .
it can be low .
or it can be a high sound .
the music can also be quiet .
or it can be very loud .
a long time ago, only the men would play a drum .
it was rare to see a woman play a drum in west africa so people were surprised when they saw a woman djembe player .
women had to work very hard to get to play .
now, there are women drum circles .
and the women are just as good as playing the music as the men .
this drum was first played in west africa .
but now it is played all over the world .
it is even played in our country .
next time you listen to music, you may hear the beat of a djembe in the song .
that's cool, right ?
alright .
do you want to read one more or do you want to move on ?
it's alright .
i can move on .
okay, thanks !
i actually know the story .
i can do a summary if you want .
you can go ahead and read it .
do you mean you know about this person ?
i know about her .
you can go ahead and read that one .
okay .
this story takes place in nineteen fifty five .
i actually didn't not know that .
one day, rosa parks had a long day at work .
rosa parks was forty two years old .
she was black .
she waited for the bus to go home .
she was very tired .
rosa got on the bus and sat down .
the seat she sat in was in the front row of the bus .
in nineteen fifty five, she had lived an unfair law .
these people started, stated if there were not enough seats on the bus for white people, black people must let the white people sit in their seats .
that's bad .
soon after rosa got on the bus, seats were full .
then, more white people got on the bus .
white people waited for rosa to get up from her seat .
rosa doesn't think it was fair .
she did not want to be treated poorly any longer because she was black .
she said no didn't get up in her seat .
rosa parks was arrested and put in jail .
many people found out what happened .
some did not think it was fair and felt mad .
so black people in her town decided we are not going to ride the bus until the law is changed .
for one year black people did not ride the bus .
finally, the law was fixed !
rosa parks helped black people to be treated fairly .
she was a role model and a leader .
all across the united states, people began to insist on being treated fairly .
that's actually good .
alright, do you want to read one more ?

now, the .
you're doing great .
i, i feel like he's connected to the buttons .
you think so ?
in a way .
okay, so let's see what happens if you click all of the buttons at once .
do you think something's going to happen ?
haha .
he gave you a little .
he's so cute .
alright, so the next thing we're going to do .
you know what ?
we'll just have jibo tell us about what we're going to do next .
what are we going to do next ?
today, we're going to do an activity together .
i'm going to show you some pictures .
and you're going to tell me about them .
okay .
okay .
so, for our first picture .
look at the picture .
i see a lion in a boat with a boy .
two fish .
one, two, three .
four lily pads .
one, two three, four, five, six, seven .
seven ffflowers .
ooh .
a mountain .
a dragonfly .
water .
that's .
i see ss, a lot of leaves .
why do you think that there's that .
that little kid is in the boat with the lion .
the lion is his best friend .
would you get in a boat with a lion ?
no .
why not ?
lions are carnivores .
but they seem to be fine in their little boat .
hehe .
that's probably because it's a fantasy story .
okay .
so if it's a story .
what do you think the story is ?
like, where do you think they're going ?
if i looked they must .
if i see a mountain .
they must be going across a pond .
cause i also see pond lilies .
i'm not sure what they're called .
okay .
so they're probably going to the other side of the pond .
okay .
but that's all i see .
okay .
where do you think they're coming from ?
i think they're coming from a mountain .
a mountain .
okay .
cool .
have you ever seen a lion before ?
where ?
i've seen pictures .
and i've seen one at the akron zoo .
zoo ?
what else did you see at the zoo ?
haha .
i honestly forget .
well .
when you saw the lion were you scared ?
no .
but i thought you said they're carnivores !
kinda scary .
it was behind glass and metal .
okay .
okay .
hmm .
you think .
how do you think the lion and the little kid met ?
and the little kid met ?
the zoo .
you think they met at the zoo ?
hmm .
would you go to the zoo and knock on the glass ?
and see if you can be friends with a lion ?
no !
by the way .
i like how your mask has a clear part for people that can't hear .
who read lips .
thank you !
all of us at the lab have one .
they're very fun .
and very nice .
hehe .
so thank you !
you're welcome .
hmm .
anything else weird about this picture .
that you think of .
anything else that kind of makes you think about ?
that fish is upside down .
when it should look like it's right side up .
why do you think the fish is upside down ?
well, that's usually a top fin .
i see .
i see .
hmm .
ss .
is this one right side up ?
it looks like it's being squished .
haha, by what ?
the boat .
why do you think ?
why do .
well, i guess .
how much do you think a lion weighs ?
last time i heard it was sixty through a hundred pounds .
that's a lot of lion .
it's cause they eat so much meat .
i see .
then why isn't the boat sinking ?
the moa .
the boat must be able to hold like a thousand pounds or something .
geez .
that's kinda cool .
we also looked at one aa .
we actually looked at one of your raiders .
and we saw that wood is used the least amm .
probably the least amount .
in .
for what ?
for energy .
interesting .
and wood is not the best, but it's .
it is sort of better since you aren't polluting the air .
got you .
people need to learn to plant more trees .
and so there's not just trees that are coming down .
i agree .
he he he .
have you ever planted a tree ?
we have never bought a sapling .
okay .
gotcha .
in this one .
i want the robot to look over there .
jibo, look over there .
jibo ?
he's very .
he's a very curious guy .
he's very curious behind you, though .
okay .
so how about .
this one .
i see a boy who looks like he wants to be a pilot when he grow up .
grows up .
i see a single car and a truck .
a fish with a lot of rocks .
some books .
a bed .
that's not made .
a sock .
and a pillow on the floor .
his window's open .
i see a tree .
and it looks like it must be summer or spring .
i see two paper airplanes .
his scarf looks like it's blowing in the wind .
i see clouds .
probably from his imagination .
okay .
and an actual airplane .
hmm .
okay .
and his window has what looks like a handle .
does your room look like this ?
no .
no ?
why not ?
i don't even have a fish .
haha, okay .
that's the part that you're worried about .
not all these clouds in this guy's room ?
is your room this messy ?
no .
no ?
unless peter parker choose to come in .
and mess it up .
okay .
got you .
for some reason i think the robot's taking what i'm saying .
and sending it to companies .
i can promise you he's not sending it to companies .
he's part of just helping us out here .
but what we want to do .
and what you're helping us do .
is so that we can teach other robots like jibo to get better .
like siri ?
so, you said he wants to be .
you think he wants to be a pilot ?
do you want to be a pilot ?
no .
do you like flying ?
what ?
i'm sort of scared of heights sometimes .
okay .
well, i'm scared of heights if it's like .
very high and i look out a window .
like on the .
on the biltmore mansion .
it's one papatio .
looking spot that's made of concrete .
i looked over the rail and i was like .
was it really scary ?
did you know that the biltmore mansion was the second house to get electricity ?
j p morgan's house was the first .
woah .
i did not know that .
it is actually a fact .
where do you learn all this stuff ?
history facts .
the men who built america .
what's that ?
it's a show about .
it's basically a history a show .
okay .
do you watch the history channel a lot ?
do you watch the history channel a lot ?
no .
no ?
i've only seen .
not even a whole episode .
i've seen hamilton .
oo, did you like it ?
what did you like about it ?
i don't know why, but my favorite song is dear theodosia .
i ff .
battle in yorktown .
oo, okay .
good one .
the song after phillip dies .
i don't know why !
i just really like it .
and the final song of the movie .
gotcha .
hmm .
who is your favorite character ?
i want you to guess where aaron burr is .
i want you to guess where aaron burr is .
where aaron burr is ?
on the .
on the scale from one to ten .
i mean zero to ten .
and ten being your absolute favorite ?
what ?
in .
is ten being your absolute favorite ?
hmm .
is he a nine ?
he's the .
or is he your least favorite ?
he's the bad guy .
so he's at zero .
he's your least favorite ?
he's a .
he's the bad guy .
but he has a little redemption in the end .
he doesn't mean it .
he literally becomes illegal .
that is true .
you got me there .
heh .
so who's your favorite ?
alexander hamilton .
alexander hamilton ?
okay .
i think the schuyler sisters would be either nine or five .
i think they were so cool .
but, i mean .
like, peggy and angelica .
but i mean .
eliza's automatic nine .
automatic nine .
okay .
that makes sense .
peggy's like a seven .
philip is probably a, a, eight .
love philip .
did you know in the dual .
hamilton .
his son was in the area .
so he wrote notes and .
to himself for .
just in case he died .
and he told his son to go help his mother .
the, .
i mean eliza .
and the .
his son argued .
but he was forced to go .
and then they spent an hour getting across the hudson river .
hmm .
then dueled .
hamilton purposefully threw away his shot .
even though in the song i am not throwing a shot .
he clearly says he does not want to throw away his shot .
but he does .
and he shoots an oak tree about like sixty feet above him .
do you like any .
so .
okay .
so, you like hamilton .
haha .
is there anything else you know a whole bunch about like this ?
not really .
not really ?
hamilton's just your favorite ?
do you like musicals ?
no .
just hamilton ?
mostly .
i like hih .
i like historical musicals .
but i'm only familiar with the new york version .
me too .
of hamilton .
did you see the one that was on disney plus ?
me too .
i i .
my mom said my g g mus .
could've watched it live .
that would've been so cool .
i don't know if you realized .
but angelica .
she has flowers for the main play .
but since there's .
they put on two different plays .
the other one .
there's nothing .
i actually only realized that when mom pointed it out .
haha .
so you know all of the little easter eggs don't you ?
i only really know that one .
what's another one ?
i have no idea .
you don't ?
okay .
hmm .
you know a lot about hamilton .
we might have to revisit that later .
alright .
let's try this picture .
say as much as you can about this one .
it looks like .
like a scientist who's thinking about an octopus .
in a lab with two .
basically, pots .
the octopus is holding a magnifying glass .
the girl has goggles .
a clipboard .
and a lightbulb .
and she has like buns i guess ?
there are four cupboards and drawers .
four books .
a, a .
two mice .
a trashcan .
and a d n a picture .
and the octopus is also holding a book .
why do you think there's an octopus in this lab ?
imagination .
imagination ?
so you don't think he's really here ?
really ?
why do you think she's imagining that there's an octopus ?
it's because octopus .
since it's not in a water tank .
they need water .
ooh .
you're totally right .
you're totally right .
though in shows they are out of water .
they can .
they basically can survive for like, two seconds without water .
interesting .
do you think the octopus is helping ?
what do you think he's helping her with ?
a study .
study ?
the girl looks like she wants to be a scientist .
ooh .
that's actually all i see .
okay .
do you like science ?
what kind of stuff have you learned about science at school ?
i don't know why .
but i feel like i learned nothing in school .
really ?
well, you're great at your alphabet .
you're great at .
you can read .
you've got .
well, you're good at math .
so you're clearly learning something .
but it just doesn't feel like it !
why not ?
i don't know .
haha .
well, do you have fun at school ?
yes .
i think .
my favorite subject is probably technology .
you have a technology class ?
that's so cool .
what do you learn in that ?
basically how to use a computer .
okay .
though i am almost a pro .
i actually helped my teacher three four five times .
cause you just already know how to work ?
i know a lot .
but i don't know everything .
so, can i say something ?
of course .
my mom taught me .
is it control z or .
i don't know what you're trying to say .
control z for cop .
i know .
control c for copy .
c, .
and then control v to paste .
and i also told her how to do the .
you undo what you did .
what was that call .
how do you dd .
how do .
was it .
control z .
control z .
it basically rewinds .
okay, so you know a lot about computers .
you know all the keyboard shortcuts .
i only know those two .
you'll learn some more .
it seems you already know them pretty well .
hehe .
anything else going on here that kinda makes you think ?
no .
no ?
i see a plant .
but that's all that really is out there .
alright .
how about in this picture ?
a girl imagining she has the biggest radish in the world .
i see a shovel .
fifteen radishes .
i'm just taking a wild guess .
okay .
a shell on a snail .
or slug .
a fence .
another snail .
another snail .
patches on her shh .
on her pants .
short sleeved .
pig tails ?
i was just using context clues since the illustrator doesn't do that .
so i was just guessing from the placement .
right, .
and i see a lot of pebbles and dirt .
okay .
and some grass .
have you ever been to a farm ?
no ?
i've seen a lot of videos and pictures, though .
would you ever go to a radish farm like this ?
nah .
no ?
why not ?
i think farms are boring .
really ?
i thought that there were so many cool things at farms .
i don't really .
i just don't know .
i don't like them .
how about these guys ?
would you ever hold a snail ?
no ?
why not ?
i've felt a slug .
what did it feel like ?
slimy .
hold on .
that reminds me of a joke .
is a snail fast without its shell ?
no .
it's more sluggish .
since slugs are slower .
haha .
alright .
you got me there .
that was a good one .
i'll give you that one .
i actually made up two jokes .
why did november do so well in school ?
i don't know .
why ?
his nickname was know it all november .
ooh !
another one is .
what did the martian say to the martian ?
what ?
do you want some mars mallows ?
those are good too .
we got a little comedian on our hands .
alright .
so you said that this was just all in her imagination .
how big this is .
why ?
cause there .
it's .
it would be fantasy if a radish grew that big .
you think so ?
what if i told you that there are some vegetables that people just grow that big ?
haha .
i think .
i think .
there are !
after this, we'll google and i'll show you a picture .
i honestly .
haha .
would you ever eat a radish that big ?
i hate radishes .
you hate radishes ?
alright .
what vegetables do you like ?
broccoli ?
okay .
but that .
peas and green beans .
but that's really it .
what's your favorite food ?
haha .
i honestly .
i have no way to answer that .
why ?
well .
i do like the papa john .
papa john's pepperoni and green pepper pizza .
okay .
haha .
and i do like their breadsticks .
so i'd say papa john's .
papa john's ?
that's a good one .
that's a good choice .
i'm hones .
ma .
we've only been eating dominos .
and i'm starting to get tired of it .
and i really want to change back to papa john's for one or two more orders .
at least, like .
at least, like .
i mean like one order .
and then do dominos for a little bit .
haha .
okay .
anything else in this picture you see .
hmm .
that you want to talk about ?
nah .
nothing ?
except she's wearing boots .
but that's it .
got you .
well .
you did amazing with that one .
you can go ahead and hit another buzzer for me .

alright .
so, tell me .
do you like reading ?

all the students finished lunch quickly .
so they could go outside for recess .
during recess .
the children enjoyed dancing to the wobble .
and the songs like the dougie .
they really enjoyed line dances and denim ?
that one's deon .
deon was one of the best dancers .
after lunch .
miss kent brought the cd player outside to the playground .
so the children could dance .
the first song to play was chacha slide .
everybody clap your hands .
dj chasper sang .
all of the students started clapping to the beat of the song .

the students stopped dancing .
and ran off to find something else to do .
miss kent said deon .
don .
deon ?
i'm just going to say deon .
okay .
do you mind if i take a look at the cd player ?
maybe i can fix it .
tha this happens all the time at home .
what a wonder .
that would be wonderful said miss kent .
deon ll took the cd out .
and looked at the bottom of it .
it was scratched .
and a little dusty .
deon checked to make sure his shirt was clean .
he wiped the cd with his shirt until it shined .
then slid it back into the player .
deon held his breath .
and pressed play .
dj chasper started playing again .
cha cha now, you all .
cha cha again .
deon smiled .
and began dancing .
all the children started running back to the dance area to join him .
they had a great time dancing .
and deon was a hero .
amazing .
do you want to read another one for me ?
this story takes place in nineteen fifty five .
one day rosa parks had a long day at work .
rosa .
by the way she died in two thousand five .
okay .
rosa was forty two years old .
she was black .
she waited for the bus to go home .
she was very tired .
rosa got on the bus .
and sat down .
the seat she sat in was at the front of the bus .
in nineteen fifty one the city she lived in had unfair laws .
the law started that if you were not enough seats on the bus for white people .
black people must let the white people sit in their seats .
soon after rosa got on the bus .
the seats were full .
then, more white people got on .
the bus .
the white people waited for rosa to get up from her seat .
rosa didn't think it was fair .
she didn't want to be treated poorly any longer .
just because she was black .
she said no and .
and did not give up her seat .
rosa parks was arrested .
and put in jail .
many people found out what hap .
what hhhad happened .
some did not think it was fair and felt mad .
so the black people in her town decided .
we are not going to ride the bus until the law is changed .
for one year black people did not ride the bus .
finally, the law was fixed .
rosa parks helped black people be treated fairly .
she was a role model and leader .
all across the united states .
people began to insist being treated fairly .

got you .
what's your fav .
so is handles your favorite ice cream place ?
i honestly think dairy queen more .
since they have the , cookie dough .
okay .
i understand .
understand .
how about this picture ?
painting ?
do you like to paint ?
so what kind of stuff do you like to paint ?
i don't know why .
but i usually just paint like lines .
just lines ?
lines .
and circles .
and turn them into people .
okay so we got a picasso, right ?
very geometric .
but cool .
that kind of stuff ?
what colors do you like to paint with ?
every color .
every color ?
except white .
that's like useless .
useless .
okay .
and how about this one ?
putting on my seat belt .
how do you put on your seat belt ?
haha .
i just grab the seat belt .
pull it .
and buckle .
and how do you know when it's buckled ?
there you go .
and now we'll do this one .
i actually saw soccer .
and i do do that .
alright .
you know what ?
this one .
so, you play soccer .
do you like .
do you like playing soccer ?
it's actually .
have you been .
my favorite sport .
i've been playing it for four years .
okay .
this is my fourth, technically .
got you .
got you .
i like dribbling .
i like scoring .
i like playing goalie .
and i sometimes do pass .
my favorite position when i'm in off field .
is dd .
wait, no .
offense .
is center field .
since you have the whole field .
instead of left wing and right wing .
okay .
hah .
and that's just how i play .
and the .
so what other sports have you played ?
basketball .
and baseball .
which, mom .
why didn't you sign me up for basketball last year ?
they didn't have it last year because of covid .
you can't fight that .
but maybe this year !
i hope so .
and what about this one ?
playing with blocks .
i hardly do this .
really ?
not even legos ?
i play with those .
but i don't really make that good creations .
i mean .
i made a watch tower .
ooh !
how big was the watch tower ?
size of two of these sheets together i guess .
oo, okay .
i mean like that plus another .
cool !
and i did actually one of the strongest designs .
instead of just stacking up, up, up .
i did basically .
so i used four by twos .
they're act .
okay .
so, the four means .
so, say i'm looking at it like this way .
there's four dots going up .
and two to the side .
right .
so i'll take up a two by two spot .
so basically half the block .
and i'll place another four by two on .
and keep doing that .
oo .
to build a design .
it's actually one of the strongest designs you can make .
since it's like bricks .
i basically make bricks .
nice !
that is so cool .
and i actually found that out .
is cause like .
if you tried to take it apart sideways .
if you were to do that with a cube .
just stacking one on top of the other .
easy .
but for that .
they're so connected that you can't do it .
right .
is there anything you really want to try to build one day ?
nothing .
nothing ?
what about a bigger tower than the one you already built ?
think you're going to top that ?
i could .
sure .
he he he .
i mean .
it's got four pillars .
i just need four two by twos .
or two by twos rounded .
okay .
and then i've beaten it .
i just need one .
i just need four for each pillar .
then i .
it's basically beaten .
well, you sound like an absolutely amazing architect to me .
haha .
my sister's better .
she is ?
want to get to know who my friend over here is ?
he'll probably introduce himself, i think .
jibo, are you going to talk about yourself ?
maybe not .
why don't we hit a buzzer first ?

eight zero zero eight .
and then, , my friend .
his name is jibo .
i think will introduce himself .
so go ahead and hit .
hi .
i'm jibo .
and i'm a social robot .

what is it here ?
twenty five .
perfect .
any ideas ?
twenty nine ?
almost !
it .
and then ?
thirty .
thirty five .
almost .
you would've gotten it .
and now we switched it up again .
what's this number ?

five hundred .
a thousand ?
alright .
now tell me what this is on there .
and if you know the answer, go ahead and tell that to me, too .
nine plus seven .
sixteen .
what's this ?
equal .
nineteen minus one .
that equals eighteen .
it's okay if you don't know this one .
i don't know it .
alright .
just tell me the numbers you see on the page .
six and three .
perfect .
same thing here .
just tell me the numbers .
twenty one and three .
perfect !
hit an .
you're doing great !

go ahead and hit another buzzer .
the green one .
that one's my favorite too .
alright .
next thing .
i'll have you look at me .
and we're going to go through these flashcards, okay ?
so if i say that this is a bag .
and now there's two of them .
there are two ?
three bags .
three bags next .
you're exactly right !
it would be next .
but we're only going to go .
by .
do one and two .
so, if we have two of them, there are two ?
go ahead and say it again .
bags ?
yep .
just like that .
easier than you think .
so if we have one dup ?
there's two dups .
we have one boat .
we have two boats .
this is .
you're exactly right, but we're going to call it a ship .
okay .
okay ?
two ships .
perfect .
this we're going to call a smide .
two smides .
this is going to go be a skack .
two skacks .
this is a cup .

back .
and we're back to the beginning !
good job !
the bag !
we made it through that quick .
go ahead and press another buzzer !
great job !
now we hit this one .
alright .
so, now, jibo's actually going to tell us what to do for this next one .
so, can't wait to see !
today, we're going to do an activity together .
i'm going to show you some pictures .
and you're going to tell me about them .
alright .
that sounds good .
which one ?
okay .
what is this ?
okay .
what do you see ?
there's a kid friends with a lion on a boat .
and they're looking at the fishies in the water .
what else do you see ?
everything you might see .
there's a bug .
those long things that look like sticks with that stuff on them .
i don't really know what that's called .
lily pads ?
what, ?
tell me a story about them .
what do you think they're doing ?
how did they get there ?
what's going on ?
they, they found a boat on the other side over there .
and they got on it and went there .
that's a pretty good idea .
that makes a lot of sense .
well then, where are they going now ?
they went to the middle .
and then they're going to go to the other side .
what's on the other side ?
the end !
that's a good .
is there anything else you can think to say about this picture ?
or see in this picture ?
it needs color .
it does need color .
that would make it all show up a lot better .
you're right .
alright, jibo .
we can go to the next one .
thank you .
what is this ?
kid wanting to jump out the window .
my gosh .
that window is open .
why would he do that ?
what does it look like he's doing ?
he's like, i want to ride an airplane because he threw a paper airplane .
he's standing on his bed .
his room's dirty .
how is it dirty ?
sock .
pillow .
toys .
that's, that's true .
and counting his bed, it's messy .
what else do you see in the picture ?
i see his dresser with clothes sticking out .
i see a picture .
and him ss tch, about to throw another airplane .
that's why you said he wanted to jump out .
and an airplane right there .
so, do you think this is real or do you think this is imaginary ?
is he pretending ?
imaginary .
that makes sense, cause who has clouds in your, in your room in a real home .
is he wearing anything silly or is he ?
is that how you would normally look when you're playing pretend ?
silly .
okay .
what, what's silly about it ?
it ain't cold in his room .
it would be a warm day .
do you think he'd be too hot in that ?
makes sense .
anything else about this pic ?
if he ain't even riding the airplanes, why would he have both ?
that is a good point !
alright, jibo .
i think we can go to the next picture .
thanks .
what is this ?
there .
there's an octopus on his head .
puffy stuff coming off his head .
he's holding a lightbulb .
science stuff .
posters it sounds .
you have a really good eye .
that's really small .
books .
books .
two mice .
what are they doing there ?
i don't know .
i think they're looking for cheese .
do you think they have cheese in there ?
do you see any ?
no .
they're trying to find their way to the cafeteria .
i would be doing the same .
makes sense .
the desk .
and tubes .
so, tell me a story about this one, then ?
how did they all get there ?
you told me about the mice .
they've .
their home was over there .
and they just crawled all the way over there, looking for cheese .
well then what about the other things in there ?
the person and the octopus .
he made .
he made an octopus .
he made an octopus ?
how ?
from science .
alright .
it came out of a big .
a small tube .
that would be really cool .
crawled its way out .
that is a smart scientist, ?
anything else you can think about this picture ?
why does he have fluffy stuff on his head ?
i don't know .
alright .
thanks jibo .
we can go to the next one .
what is this ?
oo .
that's a big vegetable .
some kind of vegetable .
there's a shovel .
there's more of them, but smaller .
there's that .
a fence .
a snail .
that's a snail .
that's a snail .
i didn't see the little .
ope, i thought that was just something else .
the leaves popping out of the ground .
clouds .
and that little animal back there .
i can't even see that .
you really do have good eyes .
thanks for seeing everything .
i was just looking at the shovel .
and then i seen it .
so tell me how this happened ?
what do you think the story is here ?
she wah wanted some vegetables .
she planted some a year ago .
okay .
then they grew .
and now she's hungry .
she's hungry ?
she has that huge vegetable !
she's going to eat it .
perfect .
that's probably why she picked it up .
that's pretty smart of you to know that you need to plant things a year in advance .
that's .
do you know how ?
do you know any farming things ?
or you been to a farm ?
you just knew that from reading ?
or on your own ?
on my own .
that's really smart, hayden .
thank you so much .
anything else to say about this picture ?
this girl's like .
do you think that means she's excited to eat it ?
or something else ?
she's like ay .
i'm going to eat something .
i haven't ate in a year .
i think that that makes total sense .
thank you, jibo !
we're all done with that !
you're doing great .
that's nice .
alright .
go ahead and hit another buzzer for me .
starting over .
nice .
alright .
can you do some reading for me ?
go ahead .

a garden is a place where people grow food or flowers .
gardens can be big or small .
gardens can be in the ground .
or they can be in a small pot .
gardens can be at home .
or a ch .
at a church .
some kids have gardens at their school .
there are gardens at the white house .
they .
the home of the president of the united states .
one garden grows food and the other garden grows .
garden is the rose garden .
you need four things to grow a garden .
a sunny spot, good oi, soil, water, and time .
a sunny spot .
plants need sunshine to grow nice vegetables and flowers .
a spot that faces sound is best .
south is best .
good soil .
soil is a kind of dirt .
piles the soil up like a small hill so that the water can go down .
the pile of soil should be about twelve inches .
or the size of a ruler .
it's good for your plants if a wor wasn't .
if a worm .
if worms live in the soil .
to invite worms, put cut leaves three inch down your soil .
water .
gardens do well if they get about one inch of rain a week .
if it is hot and dry outside, you need to give them more water to your garden .
the best test is to put up your finger in the soil .
if you can get mud on your hands, it's too .
is too wet .
if the soil is dusty, the plant needs water time .
water .
time .
some plants grow in a few weeks .
others take months .
you must wait and take care of your plants .

you can come up with a story that's super crazy .
i don't care .

where do you think they're going ?
i think they're going like they're stuck on a river .

okay .
would you be in a boat with a lion ?
why not ?
cause they're dangerous .
but why do you think the guy is in a boat with a lion ?
maybe they're friends .
maybe .
or do you think the lion's waiting to eat him ?
they're friends .
how do you think they became friends ?

it was stuck with him .
that's a cool story .

y yogurt yellow .
z zebra .
where would you see a zebra ?
at the zoo .
alright .
hit a buzzer for me .
now we're going to do ss .
you're doing an awesome job .
now we're going to do some numbers .
one .
two .
three .
four .
five .
six .
seven .
eight .
nine .
ten .
eleven .
twelve .
thirteen .
fourteen .
fifteen .
sixteen .
what happened ?
twenty .
twenty five .
thirty .
forty .
fifty .
sixty .
seventy .
eighty .
ninety .
a hundred .
two hundred .
five hundred .
one thousand .
nine plus seven .
okay .
so nine then ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen six .
sixteen .
that's easy .
twenty .
no .
eighteen .
what's that say ?
nineteen minus one equals eighteen .
that's right .
six times three .
okay .
six times three is three six times so .
six .
obviously .
nine .
twelve .
fourteen .
no .
fifteen .
eighteen .
awesome !
you got it .
god .
twenty one divided by three .
have you done division in school yet ?
no .
my dad taught me a long time ago .
but i forget .
that's okay .
so the answer is seven .
seven ?
because .
so division is the opposite of multiplication so you have to think what goes into twenty one three times .
and the answer is seven .
you're going back though .
what do you mean going back ?
that's twenty one .
how would that be seven ?
because when you divide .
what's that .
what this is saying .
twenty one divided by seven .
is what number goes into twenty one three times .
so the number has to be smaller than twenty one .
so seven .
one seven equals seven .
two sevens equals fourteen .
and three sevens equals twenty one .
so it's basically just adding up to that number .
we have to figure out what number goes into that number three times .
okay .
alright .
can you hit a buzzer ?
great job .
alright .
now we're going to do these .
so this is a cup .
now there's two ?
what would you call those ?

spit my .
bleh bleh .
the rest .
and then just rinse off my thing .
tap it on the thing a couple times .
and then i'm done .
perfect .
washing hands .
i would get my hands wet first .
and then i would get soap .
blah .
and then .
i would put it back in the water .
rinse all the soap off .
and then dry my hands .
nice !
tying .
shoes .
so .
i just do the .
cross .
and then make a loop .
tie it around .
tuck it under .
pull it through .
then do that to make sure it's tight .
and then double knot .
perfect .
pouring cereal .
i would do cereal first then milk .
then smush the cereal .
in the milk a little bit so .
it's all wet and not .
all dry .
and then i would just eat it .
perfect .
putting on clothes .
guess i would just put on clothes .

do your pants first or your shirt first ?
it depends on if i want to wear .
a certain type of top or a certain type of bottom .
and then i would just go from there .
okay .
baking cupcakes .
so i would just listen to the directions .
and then .
usually i would bake them with my sister .
and so we would .
we would pick out .
the different .
cupholders that we want .
and so we have .
and some that are mine .
maybe some that are our mom's .
but .
they're all ours .
so it doesn't matter .
but then .
me and .
my sister would just .
put the frosting on together .
and we wouldn't really use sprinkles .
but sometimes we would .
painting .
so i do painting different ways .
but when i'm doing it at my dad's i tend to just .
either just paint something .
or do .
where you make .
globs on a piece of paper .
and then you grab another piece of paper and stick it on .
cool !
buckling your car seat .
so you would .
just .
i would .
get situated .
and then i would .
take my seat belt .
make sure i know where the .
metal part is .
and then just put it in .
i don't do this .
you don't do that ?
no .
do you pretend to do anything ?
well i usually .
sometimes play games with myself .
act out one person .
and then i would act out another person .
what kin ?
what ?
what kind of things do you act out ?
random stuff .
that's cool .
dressing up in costume .
i'd just find a costume and put it on .
what kind of costumes do you have ?

okay .
sliding down a slide .
i just wait my turn if there are other people .
then just sit down and slide .
perfect .
is this just kicking a ball or playing soccer ?

i'll .
i just get the ball in front of me .
and then kick .
cool .
playing with blocks .
i don't really do that often .
really not at all .
did you used to do it when you were younger ?

i would .
once when i was playing with .
blocks .

this whole city .
that's cool .
what do you do when you're done playing with them ?
i destroy it very carefully .
you destroy it very carefully ?
alright .
what's this kid doing ?
swinging .
so sometimes i will either .
not sit on the swing yet .
but then go back with the swing .
and then once it goes forward i just jump onto it .
i uu .
sometimes i will do that .
or i would just sit on it and pump my legs .
is this eating candy or giving candy ?
i think either or maybe they're sharing ?
so if it's sharing i would just ask the person .
do you want this ?
or do you want a turn ?
what is this kid doing ?
i don't know .
what do you think ?
i don't know .
well he's sitting on a chair right ?

so the astronaut is not .
totally in space .
no .
no .
totally just .
hanging out there .
it's .
connected to this .
little wire that they have .
on spaceships .
so there's .
a little room .
and then in that room there's .
where your .
spacesuit is .
and then if you just want to go out you connect the thing onto your spacesuit .
and then you can .
and then you can just .
chill in space .
space .
because .
you're not going anywhere until that moves .
why do you ?
why do you need a spacesuit in space ?
well there's no gravity up there .
so if you didn't have a space suit then you would die .
that's true .
it also gives you oxygen ?
